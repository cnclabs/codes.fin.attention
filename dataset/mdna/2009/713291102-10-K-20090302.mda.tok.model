risk factors the businesses of phi  pepco  dpl and ace are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
the occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of any one or more of the companies  including  depending on the circumstances  its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unless otherwise noted  each risk factor set forth below applies to each of phi  pepco  dpl and ace 
phi and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation  and unfavorable regulatory treatment could have a negative effect 
the regulated utilities that compose phi s power delivery businesses are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects their operations 
each of pepco  dpl and ace is regulated by state regulatory agencies in its service territories  with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the supply and distribution of electricity and additionally for dpl the supply and distribution of natural gas 
in addition  the rates that the companies can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by ferc  and dpl s natural gas transportation is regulated by ferc 
the companies cannot change supply  distribution  or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved distribution and transmission rates are intended to permit the companies to recover their costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  the profitability of the companies is affected by the rates they are able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by any of the companies in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates  the financial results of that company  and correspondingly  phi  will be adversely affected 
phi s subsidiaries also are required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses 
phi believes that each of its subsidiaries has  and each of pepco  dpl and ace believes it has  obtained or sought renewal of the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  none of the companies is able to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require any one or more of phi s subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or significant capital expenditures or to change the way it conducts its operations 
pepco may be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the district of columbia and maryland 
phi and pepco only pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in maryland and the district of columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets 
the principal issue in the proceedings is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the internal revenue service irs in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits  and pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia and maryland allocated or assigned property 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory and other matters divestiture cases for additional information 
the operating results of the power delivery business and the competitive energy businesses fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
the power delivery business historically has been seasonal and weather patterns have had a material impact on its operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally higher in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and natural gas is generally higher in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  each of phi  pepco  dpl and ace historically has generated less revenue and income when temperatures are warmer than normal in the winter and cooler than normal in the summer 
in maryland  the adoption in of a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism for retail customers of pepco and dpl  which decouples distribution revenue for a given reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period  has had the effect of eliminating changes in the use of electricity by such retail customers due to weather conditions or for other reasons as a factor having an impact on reported revenue and income 
historically  the competitive energy operations of conectiv energy and pepco energy services also have produced less revenue when weather conditions are milder than normal  which can negatively impact phi s income from these operations 
the energy management services business of pepco energy services is not seasonal 
facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease revenues or increase expenses 
operation of the pepco  dpl and ace transmission and distribution facilities and the competitive energy businesses generation facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt generation  transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of generation  transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance  including deficiency charges imposed by pjm on generation facilities at a rate of up to two times the capacity payment that the generation facility receives 
furthermore  the generation and transmission facilities of the phi companies that are defined as elements of the bulk electric system  which is defined by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc as transmission facilities operating at a voltage of kilovolts and above  are subject to mandatory compliance with the reliability standards established by the nerc and the reliability first regional entity  which is the nerc designated regional entity with jurisdiction in the pjm region 
failure to comply with the standards may result in substantial monetary penalties and reflect poorly on the public image of phi 
the transmission facilities of the power delivery business are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on operations 
the electricity transmission facilities of pepco  dpl and ace are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and  as such  are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
ferc has designated a number of regional transmission organizations to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
pepco  dpl and ace are members of the pjm rto 
in  ferc approved pjm as the provider of transmission service in the pjm rto region  which currently consists of all or parts of delaware  illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland  michigan  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
pepco  dpl and ace operate their transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm rto and the other regional transmission organizations have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities 
however  the systems put in place by pjm rto and the other regional transmission organizations may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of pepco  dpl or ace 
if any of pepco  dpl or ace were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on it and on phi 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws  including laws relating to emissions of greenhouse gases  is significant and new environmental laws may increase expenses 
the operations of phi s subsidiaries  including pepco  dpl and ace  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  spill prevention  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations can require significant capital and other expenditures to  among other things  meet emissions and effluent standards  conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring 
if a company fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond its control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  phi s subsidiaries are required to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval  or if there is a failure to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
there is growing concern at the federal and state levels about co and other greenhouse gas emissions 
as a result  it is possible that  in addition to rggi  state and federal regulations will be developed that will impose more stringent limitations on emissions than are currently in effect 
any of these factors could result in increased capital expenditures and or operating costs for one or more generating plants operated by phi s conectiv energy and pepco energy services businesses 
until specific regulations are promulgated  the impact that any new environmental regulations  voluntary compliance guidelines  enforcement initiatives or legislation may have on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of phi and its subsidiaries is not determinable 
phi  pepco  dpl and ace each continues to monitor federal and state activity related to environmental matters in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on the operations of phi s subsidiaries or require them to incur significant additional costs 
current compliance strategies may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
failure to retain and attract key skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on operations 
the ability of each of phi and its subsidiaries  including pepco  dpl and ace  to implement its business strategy is dependent on its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees 
competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect the company s business  operations and financial condition 
phi s competitive energy businesses are highly competitive 
phi only the unregulated energy generation  supply and marketing businesses primarily in the mid atlantic region are characterized by intense competition at both the wholesale and retail levels 
phi s competitive energy businesses compete with numerous non utility generators  independent power producers  wholesale and retail energy marketers  and traditional utilities 
this competition generally has the effect of reducing margins and requires a continual focus on controlling costs 
phi s competitive energy businesses rely on some generation  transmission  storage  and distribution assets that they do not own or control to deliver wholesale and retail electricity and natural gas and to obtain fuel for their generation facilities 
phi only phi s competitive energy businesses depend on electric generation and transmission facilities  natural gas pipelines  and natural gas storage facilities owned and operated by others 
the operation of their generation facilities also depends on coal  natural gas or diesel fuel supplied by others 
if electric generation or transmission  natural gas pipelines  or natural gas storage are disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable  the competitive energy businesses ability to buy and receive and or sell and deliver wholesale and retail power and natural gas  and therefore to fulfill their contractual obligations  could be adversely affected 
similarly  if the fuel supply to one or more of their generation plants is disrupted and storage or other alternative sources of supply are not available  the competitive energy businesses ability to operate their generating facilities could be adversely affected 
changes in technology may adversely affect the power delivery business and the competitive energy businesses 
research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce electricity  including fuel cells  wind energy  micro turbines and photovoltaic solar cells 
it is possible that advances in these or other alternative technologies will reduce the costs of electricity production from these technologies  thereby making the generating facilities of the competitive energy businesses less competitive 
in addition  increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution  which could adversely affect the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl and ace and the competitive energy businesses 
changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electricity is distributed to customers which could adversely affect the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl and ace 
phi s risk management procedures may not prevent losses in the operation of its competitive energy businesses 
phi only the operations of phi s competitive energy businesses are conducted in accordance with sophisticated risk management systems that are designed to quantify risk 
however  actual results sometimes deviate from modeled expectations 
in particular  risks in phi s energy commodity activities are measured and monitored utilizing value at risk models to determine the effects of potential one day favorable or unfavorable price movements 
these estimates are based on historical price volatility and assume a normal distribution of price changes and a probability of occurrence 
consequently  if prices significantly deviate from historical prices  phi s risk management systems  including assumptions supporting risk limits  may not protect phi from significant losses 
in addition  adverse changes in energy prices may result in economic losses in phi s earnings and cash flows and reductions in the value of assets on its balance sheet under applicable accounting rules 
the commodity hedging procedures used by the competitive energy businesses may not protect them from significant losses caused by volatile commodity prices 
phi only to lower the financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  phi s competitive energy businesses routinely enter into contracts to hedge the value of their assets and operations 
as part of this strategy  phi s competitive energy businesses utilize fixed price  forward  physical purchase and sales contracts  tolling agreements  futures  financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
each of these various hedge instruments can present a unique set of risks in its application to phi s energy assets 
phi must apply judgment in determining the application and effectiveness of each hedge instrument 
changes in accounting rules  or revised interpretations to existing rules  may cause hedges to be deemed ineffective as an accounting matter 
this could have material earnings implications for the period or periods in question 
conectiv energy s objective is to hedge a portion of the expected power output of its generation facilities and the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities so it is not completely exposed to energy price movements 
hedge targets are approved by phi s corporate risk management committee and may change from time to time based on market conditions 
conectiv energy generally establishes hedge targets annually for the next three succeeding month periods 
within a given month horizon  the actual hedged positioning in any month may be outside of the targeted range  even if the average for a month period falls within the stated range 
management exercises judgment in determining which months present the most significant risk  or opportunity  and hedge levels are adjusted accordingly 
since energy markets can move significantly in a short period of time  hedge levels may also be adjusted to reflect revised assumptions 
such factors may include  but are not limited to  changes in projected plant output  revisions to fuel requirements  transmission constraints  prices of alternate fuels  and improving or deteriorating supply and demand conditions 
in addition  short term occurrences  such as abnormal weather  operational events  or intra month commodity price volatility may also cause the actual level of hedging coverage to vary from the established hedge targets 
these events can cause fluctuations in phi s earnings from period to period 
due to the high heat rate of the pepco energy services generating facilities  pepco energy services generally does not enter into wholesale contracts to lock in the forward value of its plants 
to the extent that phi s competitive energy businesses have unhedged positions or their hedging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could result in significant losses 
conversely  by engaging in hedging activities  phi may not realize gains that otherwise could result from fluctuating commodity prices 
the operations of the competitive energy businesses can give rise to significant collateral requirements 
the inability to fund those requirements may prevent the businesses from hedging associated price risks or may require curtailment of their operations 
phi only a substantial portion of pepco energy services business is the sale of electricity and natural gas to retail customers 
in conducting this business pepco energy services typically enters into electricity and natural gas sale contracts under which it is committed to supply the electricity or natural gas requirements of its retail customers over a specified period at agreed upon prices 
to acquire this energy  pepco energy services enters into wholesale purchase contracts for electricity and natural gas 
these contracts typically impose collateral requirements on each party designed to protect the other party against the risk of nonperformance between the date the contract is entered into and the date the energy is paid for 
the collateral required to be posted can be of varying forms  including cash  letters of credit and guarantees 
when energy market prices decrease relative to the supplier contract prices  pepco energy service s collateral obligations increase 
in addition  conectiv energy and pepco energy services each enter into contracts to buy and sell electricity  various fuels  and related products  including derivative instruments  to reduce its financial exposure to changes in the value of its assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations 
these contracts usually require the posting of collateral 
under various contracts entered into by both businesses  the required collateral is provided in the form of an investment grade guaranty issued by phi 
under these contracts  a reduction in phi s credit rating can also trigger a requirement to post additional collateral 
to satisfy these obligations when required  phi and its non utility subsidiaries rely primarily on cash balances  access to the capital markets and existing credit facilities 
particularly in periods of energy market price volatility  the collateral obligations associated with the competitive energy businesses can be substantial 
these collateral demands negatively affect phi s liquidity by requiring phi to draw on its capacity under its credit facilities and other financing sources 
the inability of phi to maintain the necessary liquidity also could have an adverse effect on phi s results of operations and financial condition by requiring the competitive energy businesses to forego new business opportunities  by requiring the businesses to curtail their hedging activity  thereby increasing their exposure to energy market price changes or by rendering them unable to meet their collateral obligations to counterparties 
phi and its subsidiaries have significant exposure to counterparty risk 
phi only both conectiv energy and pepco energy services enter into transactions with numerous counterparties 
these include both commercial transactions for the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas and derivative and other transactions to manage the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
under these arrangements  the competitive energy businesses are exposed to the risk that the counterparty may fail to perform its obligation to make or take delivery under the contract  fail to make a required payment or fail to return collateral posted by the competitive energy businesses when no longer required 
under many of these contracts  conectiv energy and pepco energy services are entitled to receive collateral or other types of performance assurance from the counterparty  which may be in the form of cash  letters of credit or parent guarantees  to protect against performance and credit risk 
even where collateral is provided  capital market disruptions can prevent the counterparty from meeting its collateral obligations or could degrade the value of letters of credit and guarantees as a result of the lowered rating or insolvency of the issuer or guarantor 
in the event of a bankruptcy of a counterparty  bankruptcy law  in some circumstances  could require conectiv energy and pepco energy services to surrender collateral held or payments received 
in addition  conectiv energy and pepco energy services are participants in the wholesale electric markets administered by various independent system operators isos  and in particular pjm 
if an iso incurs losses due to counterparty nonperformance  those losses are allocated to and borne by other market participants in the iso 
such defaults could adversely affect phi s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
these risks are increased during periods of significant commodity price fluctuations  tightened credit and ratings downgrades 
business operations could be adversely affected by terrorism 
the threat of  or actual acts of  terrorism may affect the operations of phi or any of its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force an increase in security measures and cause disruptions of fuel supplies and markets 
if any of its infrastructure facilities  such as its electric generation  fuel storage  transmission or distribution facilities  were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  the operations of phi  pepco  dpl or ace could be adversely affected 
corresponding instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could adversely affect the ability to raise needed capital 
insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that the companies might incur 
phi and its subsidiaries  including pepco  dpl and ace  currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
revenues  profits and cash flows may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl and ace and the competitive energy businesses 
the irs challenge to cross border energy sale and lease back transactions entered into by a phi subsidiary could result in loss of prior and future tax benefits 
phi only pci maintains a portfolio of eight cross border energy lease investments  which as of december   had an equity value of approximately billion and from which phi currently derives approximately million per year in tax benefits in the form of interest and depreciation deductions in excess of rental income 
in  the treasury department and irs issued a notice identifying sale leaseback transactions with certain attributes entered into with tax indifferent parties as tax avoidance transactions  and the irs announced its intention to disallow the associated tax benefits claimed by the investors in these transactions 
phi s cross border energy lease investments  each of which is with a tax indifferent party  have been under examination by the irs as part of the normal phi federal income tax audits 
in connection with the audit of phi s and income tax returns  the irs disallowed the depreciation and interest deductions in excess of rental income claimed by phi with respect to six of its cross border energy lease investments 
in addition  the irs has sought to recharacterize the leases as loan transactions as to which phi would be subject to original issue discount income 
phi believes that its tax position with regard to its cross border energy lease investments is appropriate based on applicable statutes  regulations and case law and is protesting the irs adjustments and the unresolved audit issues have been forwarded to the appeals office of the irs 
in the event that phi were not to prevail and were to suffer a total disallowance of the tax benefits and incur imputed original issue discount income due to the recharacterization of the leases as loans  as of december   phi would have been obligated to pay approximately million in additional federal and state taxes and million of interest 
in addition  the irs could require phi to pay a penalty of up to on the amount of additional taxes due 
phi anticipates  however that any additional taxes that it would be required to pay as a result of the disallowance of prior deductions or a recharacterization of leases as loans would be recoverable in the form of lower taxes over the remaining term of the investments 
for further discussion of this matter see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory and other matters federal tax treatment of cross border leases of this form k 
phi and its subsidiaries are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect their businesses 
phi  pepco  dpl and ace all rely on access to both short term money markets and long term capital markets as sources of liquidity and to satisfy their capital requirements that are not met by cash flow from their operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in their respective credit ratings  could increase the cost of borrowing or could prevent the companies from accessing one or more financial markets 
factors that could affect the ability of phi and its subsidiaries to access one or more financial markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies or financial institutions  significant changes in energy prices  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
in accordance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and the sec rules thereunder  phi s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls 
the inability to certify the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls also could increase financing costs or could adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets 
the funding of future defined benefit pension plan and post retirement benefit plan obligations is based on assumptions regarding the valuation of future benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
if market performance decreases plan assets or changes in assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations increase our liabilities  phi  pepco  dpl or ace may be required to make significant unplanned cash contributions to fund these plans 
phi holds assets in trust to meet its obligations under the phi retirement plan a defined benefit pension plan and its postretirement benefit plan 
the amounts that phi is required to contribute including the amounts for which pepco  dpl and ace are responsible to fund the trusts are determined based on assumptions made as to the valuation of future benefit obligations  and the investment performance of the plan assets 
accordingly  the performance of the capital markets will affect the value of plan assets 
a decline in the market value of plan assets may increase the plan funding requirements to meet the future benefit obligations 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the valuation of the liabilities of the plans 
as interest rates decrease  the liabilities increase  potentially requiring additional funding 
demographic changes  such as a change in the expected timing of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions  also may increase the funding requirements of the plans 
a need for significant additional funding of the plans could have a material adverse effect on the cash flow of phi  pepco  dpl and ace 
future increases in pension plan and other post retirement plan costs  to the extent they are not recoverable in the base rates of phi s utility subsidiaries  could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition of phi  pepco  dpl and ace 
phi s cash flow  ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its operating subsidiaries 
phi s unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities and the outstanding preferred stock of its subsidiaries 
phi only phi is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its subsidiaries  and all of phi s consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  phi s cash flow  its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the distribution of such earnings to phi in the form of dividends 
the subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or equity securities issued by phi or to make any funds available for such payment 
because the claims of the creditors of phi s subsidiaries and the preferred stockholders of ace are superior to phi s entitlement to dividends  the unsecured debt and obligations of phi are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries and to the rights of the holders of ace s preferred stock to receive dividend payments 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity which makes them vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and other government officials less likely to view energy companies such as phi and its subsidiaries in a favorable light  and may cause phi and its subsidiaries to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage an acquisition of phi 
phi only as a delaware corporation  phi is subject to the business combination law set forth in section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of phi 
because pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of phi  and each of dpl and ace is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of phi  phi can exercise substantial control over their dividend policies and businesses and operations 
pepco  dpl and ace only all of the members of each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board of directors  as well as many of pepco s  dpl s and ace s executive officers  are officers of phi or an affiliate of phi 
among other decisions  each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends  financing and capital raising activities  and acquisition and disposition of assets 
within the limitations of applicable law  and subject to the financial covenants under each company s respective outstanding debt instruments  each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends  and other business decisions  on the company s respective earnings  cash flow and capital structure  but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of phi and its other subsidiaries

general overview in  and  respectively  phi s power delivery operations produced   and of phi s consolidated operating revenues including revenues from intercompany transactions and   and of phi s consolidated operating income including income from intercompany transactions 
the power delivery business consists primarily of the transmission  distribution and default supply of electricity  which for   and  was responsible for   and  respectively  of power delivery s operating revenues 
the distribution of natural gas contributed  and of power delivery s operating revenues in  and  respectively 
power delivery represents one operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
the power delivery business is conducted by phi s three utility subsidiaries potomac electric power company pepco  delmarva power light company dpl and atlantic city electric company ace 
each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory 
each company is responsible for the delivery of electricity and  in the case of dpl  natural gas in its service territory  for which it is paid tariff rates established by the applicable local public service commission 
each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier 
the regulatory term for this supply service varies by jurisdiction as follows delaware standard offer service sos district of columbia sos maryland sos new jersey basic generation service bgs effective january   dpl sold its retail electric distribution assets and its wholesale electric transmission assets in virginia 
prior to that date  dpl supplied electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who did not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier  which is referred to in virginia as default service 
in this form k  the supply service obligations of the respective utility subsidiaries are referred to generally as default electricity supply 
pepco  dpl and ace are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories 
the rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
transmission rates are updated annually based on a ferc approved formula methodology 
pepco holdings the profitability of the power delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge 
the power delivery operating results historically have been seasonal  generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year 
operating results also can be affected by economic conditions  energy prices and the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity 
in connection with its approval of new electric service distribution base rates for pepco and dpl in maryland  effective in june the maryland rate orders  the maryland public service commission mpsc approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers 
for customers to which the bsa applies  pepco and dpl recognize distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  the bsa thus decouples the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
this change in the reporting of distribution revenue has the effect of eliminating changes in retail customer usage whether due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons as a factor having an impact on reported revenue 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from retail customers in maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
the competitive energy businesses provide competitive generation  marketing and supply of electricity and gas  and related energy management services primarily in the mid atlantic region 
these operations are conducted through subsidiaries of conectiv energy holding company collectively  conectiv energy  which engage primarily in the generation and wholesale supply and marketing of electricity and gas within the pjm interconnection  llc pjm and independent system operator new england isone wholesale markets pepco energy services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  pepco energy services  which provides retail energy supply and energy services primarily to commercial  industrial  and governmental customers 
each of conectiv energy and pepco energy services is a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
for the years ended december   and  the operating revenues of the competitive energy businesses including revenue from intercompany transactions were equal to   and  respectively  of phi s consolidated operating revenues  and the operating income of the competitive energy businesses including operating income from intercompany transactions was   and of phi s consolidated operating income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  amounts equal to   and respectively  of the operating revenues of the competitive energy businesses were attributable to electric energy and capacity  and natural gas sold to the power delivery segment 
conectiv energy s primary objective is to maximize the value of its generation fleet by leveraging its operational and fuel flexibilities 
pepco energy services primary objective is to capture retail energy supply and service opportunities predominantly in the mid atlantic region 
pepco holdings the financial results of the competitive energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices  the cost of fuel and gas to operate the conectiv energy plants  and the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power and gas supply obligations 
the competitive energy businesses  like the power delivery business  are seasonal  and therefore weather patterns can have a material impact on operating results 
through its subsidiary potomac capital investment corporation pci  phi maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions with a book value at december  of approximately billion 
this activity constitutes a fourth operating segment  which is designated as other non regulated  for financial reporting purposes 
for a discussion of phi s cross border leasing transactions  see regulatory and other matters phi s cross border energy lease investments in this management s discussion and analysis 
impact of the current capital and credit market disruptions the recent disruptions in the capital and credit markets  combined with the volatility of energy prices  have had an impact on several aspects of phi s businesses 
while these conditions have required phi and its subsidiaries to make certain adjustments in their financial management activities  phi believes that it and its subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity to fund their operations and meet their financial obligations 
these market conditions  should they continue  could have a negative effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
liquidity requirements phi and its subsidiaries depend on access to the capital and credit markets to meet their liquidity and capital requirements 
to meet their liquidity requirements  phi s utility subsidiaries and its competitive energy businesses historically have relied on the issuance of commercial paper and short term notes and on bank lines of credit to supplement internally generated cash from operations 
phi s primary credit source is its billion syndicated credit facility  which can be used by phi and its utility subsidiaries to borrow funds  obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper 
this facility is in effect until may and consists of commitments from lenders  no one of which is responsible for more than of the total billion commitment 
the terms and conditions of the facility are more fully described below under the heading capital resources and liquidity credit facilities 
due to the capital and credit market disruptions  the market for commercial paper in the latter part of was severely restricted for most companies 
as a result  phi and its subsidiaries have not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that they have typically required for cash management purposes 
to address the challenges posed by the current capital and credit market environment and to ensure that phi and its subsidiaries will continue to have sufficient access to cash to meet their liquidity needs  phi and its subsidiaries have undertaken a number of actions  including the following phi has conducted a review to identify cash and liquidity conservation measures  including opportunities to reduce collateral obligations and to defer capital expenditures due to lower than anticipated growth 
several measures to reduce pepco holdings collateral obligations and expenditures have been taken 
additional measures could be undertaken if conditions warrant 
phi issued an additional million shares of the company s common stock at a price per share of in november  for net proceeds of million 
phi added a day million credit facility in november in november  ace issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due november  in november  dpl issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due december  in december  pepco issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due december  at december   the amount of cash  plus borrowing capacity under the syndicated credit facility and phi s new day credit facility  available to meet the liquidity needs of phi on a consolidated basis totaled billion  of which million consisted of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of phi s utility subsidiaries 
during the months of january and february  the average daily amount of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of phi on a consolidated basis was billion  and of its utility subsidiaries was million 
this decrease in liquidity of phi on a consolidated basis was primarily due to increased collateral requirements of the competitive energy businesses 
during the months of january and february  the combined cash and borrowing capacity of phi s utility subsidiaries ranged from a low of million to a high of billion 
collateral requirements of the competitive energy businesses in conducting its retail energy sales business  pepco energy services typically enters into electricity and natural gas sales contracts under which it is committed to supply the electricity or natural gas requirements of its retail customers over a specified period at agreed upon prices 
generally  pepco energy services acquires the energy to serve this load by entering into wholesale purchase contracts 
to protect the respective parties against the risk of nonperformance by the other party  these wholesale purchase contracts typically impose collateral requirements that are tied to changes in the price of the contract commodity 
in periods of energy market price volatility  these collateral obligations can fluctuate materially on a day to day basis 
pepco energy services practice of offsetting its retail energy sale obligations with corresponding wholesale purchases of energy has the effect of substantially reducing the exposure of its margins to energy price fluctuations 
in addition  the non performance risks associated with its retail energy sales are relatively low due to the inclusion of governmental entities among its customers and the purchase of insurance on a significant portion of its commercial and other accounts receivable 
however  because its retail energy sales contracts typically do not have collateral obligations  during periods of declining energy prices pepco energy services is exposed to the asymmetrical risk of having to post collateral under its pepco holdings wholesale purchase contracts without receiving a corresponding amount of collateral from its retail customers 
in the second half of  the decrease in energy prices has caused a significant increase in the collateral obligations of pepco energy services 
in addition  conectiv energy and pepco energy services in the ordinary course of business enter into various contracts to buy and sell electricity  fuels and related products  including derivative instruments  designed to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to energy price fluctuations 
these contracts also typically have collateral requirements 
depending on the contract terms  the collateral required to be posted by pepco energy services and conectiv energy can be of varying forms  including cash and letters of credit 
as of december   the competitive energy businesses had posted net cash collateral of million and letters of credit of million 
at december   the amount of cash  plus borrowing capacity under the syndicated credit facility and phi s new day credit facility  available to meet the liquidity needs of the competitive energy businesses on a consolidated basis totaled million 
during the months of january and february  the combined cash and borrowing capacity available to phi s competitive energy businesses ranged from a low of million to a high of million 
ongoing monitoring of financial and market conditions phi monitors its liquidity position on a daily basis and routinely conducts stress testing to assess the impact of changes in commodity prices on its collateral requirements 
stress testing conducted over the months of january and february  based on contractual rights and obligations in effect at the time  indicated that a change in forward prices corresponding to the periods under the various contractual arrangements with respect to which collateral was required would have caused an estimated change of approximately million in conectiv energy s net collateral requirements and a change of approximately million in pepco energy services net collateral requirements 
phi s net collateral obligations decrease when forward prices increase and increase when forward prices decrease 
phi also closely monitors its credit ratings and outlooks and those of its rated subsidiaries  and computes the hypothetical effect that changes in credit ratings would have on collateral requirements and the cost of capital 
based on contractual provisions in effect at december   a one level downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of phi and each of its rated subsidiaries  which would decrease ratings to below investment grade  would increase the collateral obligations of phi and its subsidiaries by up to million 
counterparty credit risk phi is exposed to the risk that the counterparties to contracts may fail to meet their contractual payment obligations or may fail to deliver purchased commodities or services at the contracted price 
phi attempts to minimize these risks through  among other things  formal credit policies  regular assessments of counterparty creditworthiness  and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty 
pepco holdings pension and postretirement benefit plans phi and its subsidiaries sponsor pension and postretirement benefit plans for their employees 
while the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets  the stock market declines have caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets over the twelve months ended december  the negative return did not have an impact on phi s results of operations for  however  this reduction in benefit plan assets will result in increased pension and postretirement benefit costs in future years 
phi currently estimates that its net periodic pension benefit cost will be approximately million in  as compared to million in the utility subsidiaries are generally responsible for approximately to of the total phi net periodic pension benefit cost 
approximately of net periodic pension benefit cost is capitalized 
phi expects to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution to the pension plan in of approximately million 
the utility subsidiaries will be responsible for funding their share of the contribution of approximately million for pepco  million for dpl and million for ace 
phi service company is responsible to fund the remaining share of the contribution 
phi will monitor the markets and evaluate any additional discretionary funding needs later in the year 
see note  pensions and other postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in item of this form k 
business strategy phi s business strategy is to remain a mid atlantic regional diversified energy delivery utility and competitive energy services company focused on value creation and operational excellence 
the components of this strategy include achieving earnings growth in the power delivery business by focusing on transmission and distribution infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes  while maintaining a high level of operational excellence 
supplementing phi s utility earnings through competitive energy businesses that focus on serving the competitive wholesale and retail markets primarily within the pjm regional transmission organization pjm rto market 
pursuing technologies and practices that promote energy efficiency  energy conservation and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 
to further this business strategy  phi may from time to time examine a variety of transactions involving its existing businesses  including the entry into joint ventures or the disposition of one or more businesses  as well as possible acquisitions 
phi also may reassess or refine the components of its business strategy as it deems necessary or appropriate in response to a wide variety of factors  including the requirements of its businesses  competitive conditions and regulatory requirements 
pepco holdings strategic analysis of pepco energy services retail energy supply business over the past several months  phi has been conducting a strategic analysis of the retail energy supply business of pepco energy services 
this review has included  among other things  the evaluation of potential alternative supply arrangements to reduce collateral requirements or a possible restructuring  sale or wind down of the business 
as discussed above under the heading  impact of current capital and credit market disruption collateral requirements of the competitive energy businesses  as energy prices have declined in the second half of  the collateral that pepco energy services has been required to post to secure its obligations under its wholesale energy purchase contracts has increased substantially 
among the factors being considered is the return phi earns by investing capital in the retail energy supply business as compared to alternative investments 
phi expects the retail energy supply business to remain profitable based on its existing contract backlog and the margins that have been locked in with corresponding wholesale energy purchase contracts 
the increased cost of capital associated with its collateral obligations has been factored into its retail pricing and  as a consequence  pes is experiencing reduced retail customer retention levels and reduced levels of new retail customer acquisitions

conectiv energy the impact of operating revenue changes and fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales changes with respect to the conectiv energy component of the competitive energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows 
pepco holdings operating revenues of the conectiv energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity 
the primary components of its costs of sales are fuel and purchased power 
because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem  price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on operating revenue and costs of sales without signifying any change in the performance of the conectiv energy segment 
conectiv energy also uses a number of and various types of derivative contracts to lock in sales margins  and to economically hedge its power and fuel purchases and sales 
gains and losses on derivative contracts are netted in revenue and cost of sales as appropriate under the applicable accounting rules 
for these reasons  phi from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance 
conectiv energy gross margin merchant generation load service consists primarily of electric power  capacity and ancillary services sales from conectiv energy s generating plants  tolling arrangements entered into to sell energy and other products from conectiv energy s generating plants and to purchase energy and other products from generating plants of other companies  hedges of power  capacity  fuel and load  the sale of excess fuel primarily natural gas  natural gas transportation and storage  emission allowances  electric power  capacity  and ancillary services sales pursuant to competitively bid contracts entered into with affiliated and non affiliated companies to fulfill their default electricity supply obligations  and fuel switching activities made possible by the multi fuel capabilities of some of conectiv energy s power plants 
energy marketing activities consist primarily of wholesale natural gas and fuel oil marketing  the activities of the short term power desk  which generates margin by capturing price differences between power pools and locational and timing differences within a power pool  and power origination activities  which primarily represent the fixed margin component of structured power transactions such as default supply service

pepco holdings conectiv energy s revenue and cost of sales are higher in primarily due to increased default electricity supply volumes and higher energy commodity prices 
in  conectiv energy expanded its default electricity supply business into isone 
conectiv energy s margins were favorably impacted by higher energy commodity prices in the first half of  and unfavorably impacted by the decrease in prices and spark spreads during the second half of the year 
volatile commodity prices contributed to significant movements in the value of transactions accounted for at fair value 
merchant generation load service gross margin increased approximately million primarily due to an increase of approximately million primarily due to short term sales of firm natural gas  and natural gas transportation and storage rights  the dual fuel capability of the combined cycle mid merit units fuel switching  cross commodity hedging use of natural gas to hedge power positions  and the opportunities created by the mid merit combined cycle units operating flexibility option value in conjunction with short term power and fuel price volatility 
this combination of strategies positioned conectiv energy to realize the upside potential of its overall portfolio during the winter period

purchase of tax exempt auction rate bonds the redemptions in shown below include the purchase at par by phi subsidiaries of million in aggregate principal amount of insured tax exempt auction rate bonds issued by municipal authorities for the benefit of the respective phi subsidiaries 
these purchases were made in response to disruption in the market for municipal auction rate securities that made it pepco holdings difficult for the remarketing agent to successfully remarket the bonds 
these bond purchases consisted of the following the purchase by pepco of pollution control revenue refunding bonds issued by the maryland economic development corporation of an aggregate principal amount of million 
the purchase by dpl of exempt facilities refunding revenue bonds issued by the delaware economic development authority in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the purchase by ace of i pollution control revenue refunding bonds issued by cape may county in the aggregate principal amount of million and ii pollution control revenue refunding bonds issued by salem county in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the obligations of the phi subsidiaries with respect to these tax exempt bonds are considered to be extinguished for accounting purposes  however  each of the companies continues to hold the bonds  while monitoring the market and evaluating the options for reselling the bonds to the public at some time in the future 
changes in short term debt due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions  the market for commercial paper in has been severely restricted for most companies 
as a result  phi and its subsidiaries have not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that they have typically required for cash management purposes 
given their restricted access to the commercial paper market and the general uncertainty in the credit markets  phi and each of its utility subsidiaries borrowed under the primary credit facility to create a cash reserve for future short term operating needs 
as of december   phi had a loan of million outstanding and pepco had a loan of million outstanding under this facility 
in january  phi borrowed an additional million under this facility

proceeds from settlement of mirant bankruptcy claims on september   pepco transferred the panda ppa to sempra energy trading llc sempra  along with a payment to sempra  terminating all further rights  obligations and liabilities of pepco under the panda ppa 
the use of the damages received from mirant to offset above market costs of energy and capacity under the panda ppa and to make the payment to sempra reduced the balance of proceeds from the mirant settlement to approximately million as of december  pepco holdings in november  pepco filed with the district of columbia public service commission dcpsc and the mpsc proposals to share with customers the remaining balance of proceeds from the mirant settlement in accordance with divestiture sharing formulas previously approved by the respective commissions 
under pepco s proposals  district of columbia and maryland customers would receive a total of approximately million and million  respectively 
on december   the dcpsc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the sharing of the mirant divestiture proceeds  including the bankruptcy settlement proceeds 
the public comment period for the proposed rules has expired without any comments being submitted 
this matter remains pending before the dcpsc 
on february   pepco  the maryland office of people s counsel the maryland opc and the mpsc staff filed a settlement agreement with the mpsc 
the settlement  among other things  provides that of the remaining balance of the mirant settlement  pepco shall distribute million to its maryland customers through a one time billing credit 
if the settlement is approved by the mpsc  pepco currently estimates that it will result in a pre tax gain in the range of million to million  which will be recorded when the mpsc issues its final order approving the settlement 
pending the final disposition of these funds  the remaining million in proceeds from the mirant settlement is being accounted for as restricted cash and as a regulatory liability 
capital requirements capital expenditures pepco holdings total capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled million of which million was incurred by power delivery  million was incurred by conectiv energy  million was incurred by pepco energy services and million was incurred by corporate and other 
the power delivery expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services  distribution reliability  and transmission 
the table below shows the projected capital expenditures for power delivery  conectiv energy  pepco energy services and corporate and other for the five year period through for the year total millions of dollars power delivery distribution distribution blueprint for the future transmission transmission mapp gas delivery other total for power delivery business conectiv energy pepco energy services corporate and other total phi pepco holdings pepco holdings expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and external financing 
distribution  transmission and gas delivery the projected capital expenditures listed in the table for distribution other than blueprint for the future  transmission other than the mid atlantic power pathway mapp and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability 
blueprint for the future during  pepco  dpl and ace each announced an initiative that is referred to as the blueprint for the future 
these initiatives combine traditional energy efficiency programs with new technologies and systems to help customers manage their energy use and reduce the total cost of energy 
the programs include demand side management dsm efforts  such as rebates or other financial incentives for residential customers to replace inefficient appliances and for business customers to use more energy efficient equipment  such as improved lighting and hvac systems 
under the programs  customers also could receive credits on their bills for allowing the utility company to cycle  or intermittently turn off  their central air conditioning or heat pumps when wholesale electricity prices are high 
the programs contemplate that business customers would receive financial incentives for using energy efficient equipment  and would be rewarded for reducing use during periods of peak demand 
additionally  plans include the installation of smart meters for all customers in the district of columbia  maryland  delaware and new jersey  providing the utilities with the ability to remotely read the meters and identify the location of a power outage 
pepco  dpl and ace have made filings with their respective regulatory commissions for approval of certain aspects of these programs 
delaware has approved a recovery mechanism associated with these plans  and work has proceeded to prepare for the installation of an advanced metering infrastructure ami by the last quarter of on december   the dcpsc conditionally approved five dsm programs 
the cost of these programs will be recovered through a rate surcharge 
on december  the mpsc conditionally approved for both pepco and dpl  four residential and four non residential dsm energy efficiency programs 
the mpsc will consider an ami program in a separate proceeding 
phi anticipates that the costs of these programs will be recovered through a previously approved surcharge mechanism 
mapp project in october  the pjm board of managers approved phi s proposed mapp transmission project for construction of a new mile  kilovolt interstate transmission project at a then estimated cost of billion 
this mapp project will originate at possum point substation in northern virginia  connect into three substations across southern maryland  cross the chesapeake bay  tie into two substations across the delmarva peninsula and terminate at salem substation in southern new jersey 
this mapp project is part of pjm s regional transmission expansion plan required to address the reliability objectives of the pjm rto system 
on december   the pjm board approved a direct current technology for segments of the project including the chesapeake bay crossing 
with this modification  the cost of the mapp project currently is estimated at billion 
pjm has determined that the line pepco holdings segment from possum point substation to the second substation on the delmarva peninsula indian river substation is required to be operational by june  pjm is continuing to evaluate the in service date for the remaining miles of line segment to connect the indian river substation to the salem substation 
construction is expected to occur in sections over the next five year period 
delta project in december  conectiv energy announced a decision to construct a megawatt natural gas and oil fired combined cycle electricity generation plant to be located in peach bottom township  pennsylvania delta project 
the total construction expenditures for the delta project are expected to be million  of which million was expended in and million in for three combustion turbines 
projected expenditures of million in  million in  and million in are included in conectiv energy s projected capital expenditures shown in the table above 
the plant is expected to become operational during the second quarter of cumberland project in  conectiv energy began construction of a new megawatt combustion turbine power plant in millville  new jersey 
the total construction expenditures for this project are expected to be million of which million and million  respectively  were incurred in and  with projected expenditures of million in these future expenditures are included in conectiv energy s projected capital expenditures shown in the table above 
the plant is expected to become operational during the second quarter of compliance with delaware multipollutant regulations as required by the delaware multipollutant emissions regulations adopted by the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control  phi  in june  filed a compliance plan for controlling nitrogen oxide nox  sulfur dioxide so and mercury emissions from its edge moor power plant 
the plan includes installation of a sodium based sorbent injection system and a selective non catalytic reduction sncr system and carbon injection for edge moor units and  and use of an sncr system and lower sulfur oil at edge moor unit conectiv energy currently believes that with these modifications  it will be able to meet the requirements of the new regulations at an estimated capital cost of million of which million was expended through december with projected expenditures of million in dividends pepco holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration  among other factors  current and possible future developments that may affect phi s income and cash flows 
in  phi s board of directors declared quarterly dividends of cents per share of common stock payable on march   june   september  and december  on january   the board of directors declared a dividend on common stock of cents per share payable march   to shareholders of record on march  pepco holdings phi generates no operating income of its own 
accordingly  its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries 
in addition to their future financial performance  the ability of phi s direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by i state corporate and regulatory laws  which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and  in the case of regulatory laws  as applicable  may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid  ii the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock  mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries  and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities  and iii certain provisions of ace s certificate of incorporation which provides that  if any preferred stock is outstanding  no dividends may be paid on the ace common stock if  after payment  ace s common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock 
pepco and dpl have no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
currently  the restriction in the ace charter does not limit its ability to pay dividends 
pension funding pepco holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan the phi retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of pepco  dpl and ace and certain employees of other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
as of the valuation  the phi retirement plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa without requiring any additional funding 
phi s funding policy with regard to the phi retirement plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of of its accumulated benefit obligation abo and that is at least equal to the funding target as defined under the pension protection act of the funding target under the pension protection act is of accrued liabilities phased in over time 
the funding target was for and is of the accrued liability for in and  no contributions were made to the phi retirement plan 
in  the abo for the phi retirement plan decreased to billion from billion in  due to an increase in the discount rate from to 
the phi retirement plan assets experienced a negative return of in  below the level assumed in the valuation 
as a result of the combination of these factors  the funding level at year end was below both of the abo and the funding target for january  although phi projects there will be no minimum funding requirement for under the pension protection act  phi expects to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution of approximately million to bring its plan assets to at least the funding target level for under the pension protection act

hedge activity and trading activities recorded at fair value through accumulated other comprehensive income aoci or on the statements of earnings  as required 
the million net liability on energy contracts at december  was primarily attributable to losses on power swaps and natural gas futures and swaps designated as hedges of future energy purchases or production under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
prices of electricity and natural gas declined during the second half of  which resulted in unrealized losses on the energy contracts of the competitive energy businesses 
these businesses recorded unrealized losses of million on energy contracts in other comprehensive income as these energy contracts were effective hedges under sfas no 
when these energy contracts settle  the related realized gains or losses are expected to be largely offset by the realized loss or gain on future energy purchases or production that will be used to settle the sales obligations of the competitive energy businesses to their customers 
pepco holdings phi uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of the commodity and derivative contracts that its competitive energy businesses hold and sell

contractual arrangements with credit rating triggers or margining rights under certain contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy business and other transactions  the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the subsidiary are downgraded 
in the event of a downgrade  the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade 
based on contractual provisions in effect at december   a one level downgrade in the unsecured debt credit ratings of phi and each of its rated subsidiaries  which would decrease phi s rating to below investment grade  would increase the collateral obligation of phi and its subsidiaries by up to million 
phi believes that it and its utility subsidiaries currently have sufficient liquidity to fund their operations and meet their financial obligations 
many of the contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and default electricity supply activities include margining rights pursuant to which the phi subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements 
pursuant to these margining rights  the affected phi subsidiary may pepco holdings receive  or be required to post  collateral due to energy price movements 
as of december   pepco holdings subsidiaries engaged in competitive energy activities and default electricity supply activities provided net cash collateral in the amount of million in connection with these activities 
environmental remediation obligations phi s accrued liabilities as of december  include approximately million  of which million is expected to be incurred in  for potential environmental cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party  is alleged to be a third party contributor  or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property 
for information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities  see item business environmental matters  of this form k 
the most significant environmental remediation obligations as of december   were million  of which million is expected to be incurred in  payable by dpl in accordance with a consent agreement reached with the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control  for remediation  site restoration  natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the indian river power plant  which was sold in june million in environmental remediation costs  of which million is expected to be incurred in  payable by conectiv energy associated with the deepwater generating facility 
less than million for environmental remediation costs related to former manufactured gas plant operations at a cambridge  maryland site on dpl owned property  adjacent property and the adjacent cambridge creek  all of which is expected to be incurred in million  constituting pepco s liability for a remedy at the metal bank cottman avenue site 
million  most of which is expected to be incurred in  payable by dpl in connection with the wilmington coal gas south site located in wilmington  delaware  to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant 
less than million  of which a small portion is expected to be incurred in  payable by pepco for long term monitoring associated with a pipeline oil release that occurred in sources of capital pepco holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs  such as capital expenditures  dividends  and new investments  and its short term funding needs  such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs  include internally generated funds  securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities 
phi s ability to pepco holdings generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions  diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect efficient access to certain of phi s potential funding sources 
see item a  risk factors  of this form k  for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
internally generated cash the primary source of pepco holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business 
additional sources of funds include cash flow generated from its non regulated subsidiaries and the sale of non core assets 
short term funding sources pepco holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to fund temporarily long term capital requirements 
pepco holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
pepco and dpl have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to million  and ace up to million 
the commercial paper can be issued with maturities of up to days 
due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions  however  the market for commercial paper has been severely restricted for most companies 
as a result  phi and its subsidiaries have not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that they have typically required for cash management purposes 
a further description of the existence and availability of the sources of short term funding  and the impact of the ongoing capital and credit market disruptions  is set forth above under the headings impact of the current capital and credit market disruptions collateral requirements of the competitive energy businesses and credit facilities 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for phi and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness 
regulatory restrictions on financing activities the issuance of debt securities by phi s principal subsidiaries requires approval of either ferc or one or more state public utility commissions 
neither ferc approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by phi 
state financing authority pepco s long term financing activities including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt are subject to authorization by the dcpsc and mpsc 
dpl s long term financing activities are subject to authorization by mpsc and the delaware public service pepco holdings commission dpsc 
ace s long term and short term consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less financing activities are subject to authorization by the njbpu 
each utility  through periodic filings with the state public service commission s having jurisdiction over its financing activities  typically seeks to maintain standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period 
ferc financing authority under the federal power act fpa  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities  but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating 
under these provisions  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by pepco and dpl 
pepco and dpl have obtained ferc authority for the issuance of short term debt 
because conectiv energy and pepco energy services also qualify as public utilities under the fpa and are not regulated by a state utility commission  ferc also has jurisdiction over the issuance of securities by those companies 
conectiv energy and pepco energy services have obtained the requisite ferc financing authority in their respective market based rate orders 
money pool pepco holdings operates a system money pool  or an intra system cash management program under a blanket authorization adopted by ferc 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by pepco holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool 
pepco holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by pepco holdings 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on pepco holdings short term borrowing rate 
pepco holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants  which may require pepco holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources 
regulatory and other matters for a discussion of material pending matters such as regulatory and legal proceedings  and other commitments and contingencies  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in item of this form k 
critical accounting policies general pepco holdings has identified the following accounting policies  including certain estimates  that as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes in its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
pepco holdings has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
pepco holdings goodwill impairment evaluation phi believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because they are subjective and susceptible to change from period to period as management makes assumptions and judgments and the impact of a change in assumptions could be material to financial results 
substantially all of phi s goodwill was generated by pepco s acquisition of conectiv in and is allocated to the power delivery reporting unit for purposes of assessing impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

management has identified power delivery as a single reporting unit based on the aggregation of components 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test under sfas no 
compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
management uses its best judgment to make reasonable projections of future cash flows for power delivery when estimating the reporting unit s fair value 
in addition  phi selects a discount rate for the associated risk with those estimated cash flows 
these judgments are inherently uncertain  and actual results could vary from those used in phi s estimates 
the impact of such variations could significantly alter the results of a goodwill impairment test  which could materially impact the estimated fair value of power delivery and potentially the amount of any impairment recorded in the financial statements 
phi tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of july  and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
factors that may result in an interim impairment test include  but are not limited to a change in identified reporting units  an adverse change in business conditions  a protracted decline in stock price causing market capitalization to fall below book value  an adverse regulatory action  or impairment of long lived assets in the reporting unit 
phi s july  annual impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired 
phi performed an interim test of goodwill for impairment at december  as its market capitalization was below its book value for a significant part of the fourth quarter of  and it concluded that its goodwill was not impaired 
details about the interim test at year end and the results are included in note  goodwill  in phi s consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
in order to estimate the fair value of the power delivery reporting unit  phi reviews the results from two discounted cash flow models 
the models differ in the method used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit 
one estimate of terminal value is based on a constant  annual cash flow growth rate that is consistent with power delivery s plan  and the other estimate of terminal value is based on a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization that management believes is consistent with relevant market multiples for comparable utilities 
each model uses a cost of capital appropriate for a regulated utility as the discount rate for the estimated cash flows associated with the reporting unit 
neither valuation model evidenced impairment of goodwill 
phi has consistently used this valuation model to estimate the fair value of power delivery since the adoption of sfas no 
the estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to interest rates  growth assumptions  assumptions about regulatory ratemaking pepco holdings proceedings  operating and capital expenditure requirements and other factors  changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing 
assumptions and methodologies used in the models were consistent with historical experience 
a hypothetical percent decrease in fair value of the power delivery reporting unit at december  would not have resulted in the power delivery reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment test as defined in sfas no 
sensitive  interrelated and uncertain variables that could decrease the estimated fair value of the power delivery reporting unit include utility sector market performance  sustained adverse business conditions  the results of rate making proceedings  higher operating and capital expenditure requirements  a significant increase in the cost of capital and other factors 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because i they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco holdings considers historical cash flows 
pepco holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
if necessary  the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill discussed above 
accounting for derivatives pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent critical accounting estimates because i the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and or interest rate fluctuations  ii there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances  iii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iv changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to pepco holdings assets  liabilities  other comprehensive income loss  and results of operations 
see note  significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives  to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in item of this form k for information on phi s accounting for derivatives 
pepco holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative pepco holdings instruments and hedging activities  as amended  governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value 
the fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available 
for instruments that are not traded on an exchange  external broker quotes are used to determine fair value 
for some custom and complex instruments  internal models are used to interpolate broker quality price information 
for certain long dated instruments  broker or exchange data is extrapolated for future periods where limited market information is available 
models are also used to estimate volumes for certain transactions 
the same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative  commodity exposure for risk management purposes 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because i they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  ii they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and iii changes in assumptions could impact pepco holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  and the reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement 
assumptions about the future  including the expected return on plan assets  discount rate applied to benefit obligations  the anticipated rate of increase in health care costs and participant compensation have a significant impact on employee benefit costs 
in terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in the critical assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant  pepco holdings estimates that a 
decrease in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a million increase in net periodic benefit cost 
additionally  pepco holdings estimates that a 
reduction in the expected return on plan assets could result in a million increase in net periodic benefit cost 
a increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a million increase net periodic benefit cost 
in addition to its impact on cost  a 
decrease in the discount rate would increase phi s projected pension benefit obligation by million and would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million at december  pepco holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions  and benchmarks its critical assumptions against other corporate plans 
the impact of changes in assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of earnings 
for additional discussion  see note  pensions and other postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in item of this form k 
regulation of power delivery operations the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  apply to the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl  and ace 
pepco holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities pepco holdings represent critical accounting estimates because i a significant amount of judgment is required including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets  ii actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material 
unbilled revenue unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by pepco holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed 
pepco holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology 
this methodology is based on the supply of electricity or gas distributed to customers 
pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent critical accounting estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors such as customer sales mix and estimated power line losses estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers  all of which are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change from period to period  the impact of which could be material 
accounting for income taxes pepco holdings and the majority of its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
pepco holdings accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and effective january   adopted fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the criteria for recognition of tax benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 and prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
specifically  it clarifies that an entity s tax benefits must be more likely than not of being sustained assuming that position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements 
if the position drops below the more likely than not standard  the benefit can no longer be recognized 
assumptions  judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes 
pepco holdings assumptions  judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities 
pepco holdings has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although pepco holdings believes that these assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or its interpretation of tax laws and the resolutions of the current and any future investigations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
under sfas no 
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded  representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes 
pepco holdings evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and pepco holdings the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented  if necessary  to realize deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets

pepco management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potomac electric power company general overview potomac electric power company pepco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in washington  dc and major portions of montgomery county and prince george s county in suburban maryland 
pepco provides default electricity supply  which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier  in both the district of columbia and maryland 
default electricity supply is known as standard offer service in both the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco s service territory covers approximately square miles and has a population of approximately million 
as of december   approximately of delivered electricity sales were to maryland customers and approximately were to washington  dc customers 
in connection with its approval of new electric service distribution base rates for pepco in maryland  effective in june  the maryland rate order  the maryland public service commission mpsc approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers 
for customers to which the bsa applies  pepco recognizes distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  the bsa thus decouples the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
this change in the reporting of distribution revenue has the effect of eliminating changes in retail customer usage whether due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons as a factor having an impact on reported revenue 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue from retail customers in maryland to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of pepco holdings  inc phi or pepco holdings 
because phi is a public utility holding company subject to the public utility holding company act of puhca  the relationship between phi and pepco and certain activities of pepco are subject to the regulatory oversight of federal energy regulatory commission under puhca impact of the current capital and credit market disruptions the recent disruptions in the capital and credit markets have had an impact on pepco s business 
while these conditions have required pepco to make certain adjustments in its financial management activities  pepco believes that it currently has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its financial obligations 
these market conditions  should they continue  however  could have a negative effect on pepco s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
pepco liquidity requirements pepco depends on access to the capital and credit markets to meet its liquidity and capital requirements 
to meet its liquidity requirements  pepco historically has relied on the issuance of commercial paper and short term notes and on bank lines of credit to supplement internally generated cash from operations 
pepco s primary credit source is phi s billion syndicated credit facility  under which pepco can borrow funds  obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper in an amount up to million subject to the limitation that the total utilization by pepco and phi s other utility subsidiaries cannot exceed million 
this facility is in effect until may and consists of commitments from lenders  no one of which is responsible for more than of the total commitment 
due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions  the market for commercial paper was severely restricted for most companies 
as a result  pepco has not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that it typically has required for cash management purposes 
given its restricted access to the commercial paper market and the uncertainty in the credit markets generally  pepco borrowed million under the credit facility to create a cash reserve for future short term operating needs at december  after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit and commercial paper  phi s utility subsidiaries have an aggregate of million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under the credit facility at december  during the months of january and february  the average daily amount of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of phi s utility subsidiaries was million and ranged from a low of million to a high of billion 
to address the challenges posed by the current capital and credit market environment and to ensure that it will continue to have sufficient access to cash to meet its liquidity needs  pepco has identified a number of cash and liquidity conservation measures  including opportunities to defer capital expenditures due to lower than anticipated growth 
several measures to reduce expenditures have been taken 
additional measures could be undertaken if conditions warrant 
due to the financial market conditions  which have caused uncertainty of short term funding  pepco issued million in long term debt securities in december  with the proceeds used to refund short term debt incurred to finance utility construction and operations on a temporary basis and incurred to fund the temporary repurchase of tax exempt auction rate securities 
pension and postretirement benefit plans pepco participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by phi for its employees

ace management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations atlantic city electric company general overview atlantic city electric company ace is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in southern new jersey 
ace provides default electricity supply  which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier 
default electricity supply is also known as basic generation service bgs in new jersey 
ace s service territory covers approximately  square miles and has a population of approximately million 
ace is a wholly owned subsidiary of conectiv  which is wholly owned by pepco holdings  inc phi or pepco holdings 
because phi is a public utility holding company subject to the public utility holding company act of puhca  the relationship between phi and ace and certain activities of ace are subject to the regulatory oversight of federal energy regulatory commission under puhca discontinued operations in february  ace completed the sale of the bl england generating facility 
bl england comprised a significant component of ace s generation operations and its sale required discontinued operations presentation under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  on ace s consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended december  and in september  ace sold its interests in the keystone and conemaugh generating facilities  which for the year ended december   is also reflected as discontinued operations 
the following table summarizes information related to the discontinued operations for the years presented millions of dollars operating revenue income before income tax expense net income impact of the current capital and credit market disruptions the recent disruptions in the capital and credit markets have had an impact on ace s business 
while these conditions have required ace to make certain adjustments in its financial management activities  ace believes that it currently has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and meet its financial obligations 
these market conditions  should they continue  however  could have a negative effect on ace s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
ace liquidity requirements ace depends on access to the capital and credit markets to meet its liquidity and capital requirements 
to meet its liquidity requirements  ace historically has relied on the issuance of commercial paper and short term notes and on bank lines of credit to supplement internally generated cash from operations 
ace s primary credit source is phi s billion syndicated credit facility  under which ace can borrow funds  obtain letters of credit and support the issuance of commercial paper in an amount up to million subject to the limitation that the total utilization by ace and phi s other utility subsidiaries cannot exceed million 
this facility is in effect until may and consists of commitments from lenders  no one of which is responsible for more than of the total commitment 
due to the recent capital and credit market disruptions  the market for commercial paper was severely restricted for most companies 
as a result  ace has not been able to issue commercial paper on a day to day basis either in amounts or with maturities that it typically has required for cash management purposes 
after giving effect to outstanding letters of credit and commercial paper  phi s utility subsidiaries have an aggregate of million in combined cash and borrowing capacity under the credit facility at december  during the months of january and february  the average daily amount of the combined cash and borrowing capacity of phi s utility subsidiaries was million and ranged from a low of million to a high of billion 
to address the challenges posed by the current capital and credit market environment and to ensure that it will continue to have sufficient access to cash to meet its liquidity needs  ace has identified a number of cash and liquidity conservation measures  including opportunities to defer capital expenditures due to lower than anticipated growth 
several measures to reduce expenditures have been taken 
additional measures could be undertaken if conditions warrant 
due to the financial market conditions  which have caused uncertainty of short term funding  ace issued million in long term debt securities in november 
the proceeds were used to refund short term debt incurred to finance utility construction and operations on a temporary basis and incurred to fund the temporary repurchase of tax exempt auction rate securities 
pension and postretirement benefit plans ace participates in pension and postretirement benefit plans sponsored by phi for employees 
while the plans have not experienced any significant impact in terms of liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the disruption of the capital and credit markets  the recent stock market declines have caused a decrease in the market value of benefit plan assets in ace expects to contribute approximately million to the pension plan in ace results of operations the following results of operations discussion compares the year ended december  to the year ended december  other than this disclosure  information under this item has been omitted in accordance with general instruction i a to the form k

work and services includes mutual assistance to other utilities  highway relocation  rentals of pole attachments  late payment fees  and collection fees 
in response to an order issued by the new jersey board of public utilities regarding changes to ace s retail transmission rates  ace has established deferred accounting treatment for the difference between the rates that ace is authorized to charge its customers for the transmission of default electricity supply and the cost that ace incurs based on transmission formula rates approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
under the deferral arrangement  any over or under recovery is deferred as part of deferred electric service costs pending an adjustment of retail rates in a future proceeding 
as a consequence of the order  effective january   ace s retail transmission revenue is being recorded as default supply revenue  rather than as regulated t d electric revenue  thereby conforming to the practice of phi s other utility subsidiaries  which previously established deferred accounting treatment for any over or under recovery of retail transmission rates relative to the cost incurred based on ferc approved transmission formula rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies for phi and its subsidiaries are determined by phi s corporate risk management committee  the members of which are phi s chief risk officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  general counsel  chief information officer and other senior executives 
the corporate risk management committee monitors interest rate fluctuation  commodity price fluctuation  and credit risk exposure  and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements 
for information about phi s derivative activities  other than the information disclosed herein  refer to note  significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives and note  use of derivatives in energy and interest rate hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements of phi set forth in item of this form k 
pepco holdings  inc commodity price risk the competitive energy segments actively engage in commodity risk management activities to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations 
certain of these risk management activities are conducted using instruments classified as derivatives under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the competitive energy segments also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives 
the competitive energy segments primary risk management objectives are to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate their electric generation plants and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those plants by selling forward a portion of their projected plant output and buying forward a portion of their projected fuel supply requirements and to manage the spread between wholesale and retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments in order to ensure stable and known cash flows and fix favorable prices and margins when they become available 
phi s risk management policies place oversight at the senior management level through the corporate risk management committee which has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the competitive energy businesses energy market participation 
phi collectively refers to these energy market activities  including its commodity risk management activities  as energy commodity activities 
phi uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its competitive energy segments energy commodity activities 
phi also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities  including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits 
var represents the potential fair value loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level 
phi estimates var using a delta normal variance covariance model with a percent  one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
since var is an estimate  it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
value at risk associated with energy contracts for the year ended december  millions of dollars var for competitive energy commodity activity a confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed period end average for the period high low a this column represents all energy derivative contracts  normal purchase and sales contracts  modeled generation output and fuel requirements and modeled customer load obligations for phi s energy commodity activities 
conectiv energy economically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change 
economic hedge percentages include the estimated electricity output of conectiv energy s generation plants and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 other derivative instruments  wholesale normal purchase and sales contracts  and default electricity supply contracts 
conectiv energy maintains a forward month program with targeted ranges for economically hedging its projected plant output combined with its energy purchase commitments 
beginning in  conectiv energy changed its disclosure to show the percentage of its entire expected plant output and energy purchase commitments for all hours that are hedged  as opposed to its hedged position with respect to its projected on peak plant output and on peak energy commitments  which previously was disclosed 
this change was made in recognition of the significant quantity of projected off peak plant output and purchase commitments and due to the increased volatility of power prices during off peak hours 
also beginning in  conectiv energy is including default electricity supply contracts and associated hedges in independent system operator new england 
the hedge percentages for all expected plant output and purchase commitment based on the current forward electricity price curve are as follows month target range the primary purpose of the risk management program is to improve the predictability and stability of margins by selling forward a portion of projected plant output  and buying forward a portion of projected fuel supply requirements 
within each period  hedged percentages can vary significantly above or below the average reported percentages 
as of december   the electricity sold forward by conectiv energy as a percentage of projected plant output combined with energy purchase commitments was   and for the month  month and month forward periods  respectively 
the amount of forward sales during the month period represents of conectiv energy s combined total generating capability and energy purchase commitments 
the volumetric percentages for the forward periods can vary and may not represent the amount of expected value hedged 
not all of the value associated with conectiv energy s generation activities can be hedged such as the portion attributable to ancillary services and fuel switching due to the lack of market products  market liquidity  and other factors 
also the hedging of locational value can be limited 
pepco energy services purchases electric and natural gas futures  swaps  options and forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for delivery to customers 
pepco energy services accounts for its futures and swap contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
its options contracts and certain commodity contracts that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are marked to market through current earnings 
its forward contracts are accounted for using standard accrual accounting since these contracts meet the requirements for normal purchase and sale accounting under sfas no
