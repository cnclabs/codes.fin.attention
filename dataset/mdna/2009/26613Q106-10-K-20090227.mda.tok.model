following the closing of the credit facility  each of the former members of these entities held a direct or indirect equity interest in safari

ch phase i is leased as of february  
table of contents we derive substantially all of our revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our operating properties 
because we believe that critical load is the primary factor that tenants evaluate in choosing a data center  we establish our rents based on both the amount of power that we make available to our tenants and the amount of raised square footage that our tenants occupy 
the relationship between raised square footage and critical load varies from one facility to the next 
for example  a data center that is smaller in terms of raised square footage may contain infrastructure that provides its tenants with critical load that exceeds the power capacity of a data center with a significantly larger footprint 
each of our leases includes pass through provisions under which our tenants are required to pay for their pro rata share of most of our operating expenses commonly referred to as a triple net lease 
in particular  our tenants are required to pay all of their direct operating expenses  including direct electric  as well as their pro rata share of indirect operating expenses  such as real estate taxes and insurance 
we intend to continue to structure future leases as triple net leases 
although our leases provide for annual escalation of rents  we derive revenue growth primarily from leasing up vacant data center space 
as of december   we had a vacancy rate at acc and a vacancy rate at ch in february  we executed a lease at acc that lowered our vacancy rate to 
our revenue will fluctuate based upon the speed in which these properties and any development properties that are placed into service are leased up 
additionally  under our triple net leases  we receive expense reimbursement from tenants only on space that is leased 
vacant space results in portions of our operating expenses being unreimbursed  which in turn impacts net income negatively 
the amount of net rental income generated by the properties in our portfolio depends on our ability to maintain the historical lease rates of currently leased space and to re lease space available from lease terminations 
as of december   of the total critical load available in our stabilized data center properties  accounting for of annualized rent from these properties  is subject to a lease expiring on december  our operating properties are located in northern virginia and suburban chicago  illinois 
changes in the conditions of these markets will impact the overall performance of our operating properties 
the ability of our tenants to fulfill their lease commitments could be impacted by future economic or regional downturns in the markets in which we operate or downturns in the technology industry 
if these or other conditions cause a tenant to default on its payment or other obligations  we could be forced to terminate the related lease 
we believe that most of our tenants will renew their leases and that our tenants will continue to make their rental and other payments when due 
nevertheless  if we cannot attract replacement tenants on similar terms in a timely manner for any leases that are not renewed or are terminated  our rental income will be impacted adversely in future periods 
our taxable reit subsidiary trs  df technical services  llc  generates revenue by providing certain technical services to our tenants on a contract or purchase order basis  which we commonly refer to as a la carte services 
our trs will generally charge our tenants for these services on a cost plus basis 
because the degree of utilization of our trs for these services is within the control of our tenants  we have limited ability to forecast future revenue from this source 
moreover  as a taxable corporation  our trs is subject to federal  state and local corporate taxes and is not required to distribute its income  if any  to us for purposes of making additional distributions to our stockholders 
because demand for its services is unpredictable  we anticipate that our trs may retain a significant amount of its revenue to fund future services  and therefore we may not be able to regularly receive distributions from our trs 
our future growth is dependent on completing the construction and lease up of our development properties 
as of the date of this report  construction on nj and sc has been suspended until we achieve a certain level of pre leasing at these properties and we obtain financing to complete development 
suspension of development not only impedes future growth  but negatively impacts our net income in current periods 
for instance  we cannot capitalize interest on either of these projects until the project is restarted  resulting in a negative impact to earnings in additionally  if we obtain financing at interest rates greater than our average cost of capital  
table of contents once the project is completed and interest expense is no longer capitalized  our interest expense would increase 
last  if financing cannot be obtained to complete these projects  one or both of the projects in the future may be deemed to be impaired from an accounting perspective  which would require us to take a charge against net income equal to the amount of impairment 
in the current economic environment  certain types of real estate are experiencing declines in value 
if this trend were to be experienced by our datacenters  we may have to write down the value of the datacenters resulting in a charge against earnings  and could result in violations of covenants in the loan agreements that govern our long term indebtedness 
results of operations since our formation on march  until the closing of our ipo on october   we did not have any corporate activity other than the issuance of shares of common stock in connection with the initial capitalization of our company

operating results for the acquired properties are only reflected for the period subsequent to august  for the periods after the ipo  operating results are presented for the company  which includes the predecessor  the acquired properties  acc  nj  sc and acc and the other formation transactions 
to facilitate a comparison of results of operations for and  we have combined in the discussion below the operating results for our predecessor for the period from january  to october  with the operating results for the company for the period from october  to december  nonetheless  management believes that a year over year comparison may be of limited usefulness due to significant differences in the composition of our portfolio over such time 
in addition  the comparison may be of limited value because  prior to our ipo  our predecessor paid management and asset management fees to affiliates of our sponsors

this development not only requires us to make substantial capital investments  but also increases our operating expenses  which impacts our cash flows from operations negatively until leases are executed and we begin to realize revenue 
in addition  we elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december  and are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annualized basis 
we expect to meet our datacenter development needs through secured borrowings  mezzanine financings  construction financings and the issuance of additional debt and equity securities when market conditions permit 
any increases in project development costs including the cost of labor and materials and costs resulting from construction delays  and rising interest rates would increase the additional funds necessary to complete these projects and  in turn  the amount of additional capital that we would need to raise 
in determining the source of capital to meet our long term liquidity needs  we will evaluate our level of indebtedness and leverage ratio  our cash flow expectations  the state of the capital markets  interest rates and other terms for borrowing  and the relative timing considerations and costs of borrowing or issuing additional securities 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced the temporary suspension of three projects under development  phase i of acc  nj and sc  because funding from a term loan secured by acc described below was less than anticipated

the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we describe below those accounting policies that we deem critical and require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof 
revenue recognition 
rental income is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases  which commences when control of the space and the critical power have been provided to the tenant 
deferred rent included in our consolidated balance sheets represents the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual rental payments that will be recognized under the remaining terms of the leases 
our leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses incurred by us 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue and of below market leases as an increase to rental revenue 
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned  including a determination of the lease commencement date for accounting purposes and the collectability of our accounts receivable related to minimum rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements  and other income 
we analyze individual accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 

table of contents capitalization of costs 
we capitalize pre acquisition costs related to probable property acquisitions 
we also capitalize direct and indirect costs related to construction and development  including property taxes  insurance and financing costs relating to properties under development 
costs previously capitalized related to any potential property acquisitions no longer considered probable are expensed  which may have a material adverse effect on our net income 
in addition  the company ceases cost capitalization after a wind down period when a development is temporarily suspended 
the selection of costs to capitalize and the determination of whether a proposed acquisition is probable are subjective and depends on many assumptions including the timing of potential acquisitions and the probability that future acquisitions occur 
variations in these assumptions would yield different amounts of capitalized costs in the periods presented 
all capital improvements for the income producing properties that extend the property s useful life are capitalized 
useful lives of assets 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the major components of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
for example  if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate  we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
the opposite is true if we were to lengthen the expected useful lives of such properties 
asset impairment evaluation 
we review the carrying value of our net real estate on a quarterly and annual basis 
we base our review on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property  which would result in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
one of our key assumptions in the analysis is that we will complete phase i of nj and sc  which are temporarily suspended as of the date of this filing 
since cash flows from properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions dictate an earlier sale date or if we determine that development of a project is no longer viable  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
we estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement permits an entity to elect to measure eligible items at fair value fair value option including many financial instruments 
the objective of this statement is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the provisions of this statement were effective for us as of january  if the fair value option is elected  the reporting company reports unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected is recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
the fair value option may be applied for a single 
table of contents eligible item without electing it for other identical items  with certain exceptions  and must be applied to the entire eligible item and not to a portion of the eligible item 
the company did not elect the fair value option with respect to any eligible item and  therefore  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
this statement changes the accounting for acquisitions specifically eliminating the step acquisition model  changing the recognition of contingent consideration from being recognized when it is probable to being recognized at the time of acquisition  disallowing the capitalization of transaction costs and delays when restructurings related to acquisitions can be recognized 
the standard is effective for fiscal years ending after december  and will impact the accounting only for acquisitions we make after its adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
under this statement  noncontrolling interests are considered equity and thus our practice of reporting minority interests in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet will be eliminated 
also  under the new standard  net income will encompass the total income of all consolidated subsidiaries and there will be separate disclosure on the face of the income statement of the attribution of that income between controlling and noncontrolling interests 
last  increases and decreases in noncontrolling interests will be treated as equity transactions 
the standard is effective for fiscal years ending after december  in march  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement require entities to provide greater transparency about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial positions  results of operations  and cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company will adopt the expanded disclosure requirements of this standard effective january  in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
in this fsp  the fasb concluded that all outstanding invested share based payment awards that contain rights to non forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and  accordingly  are considered participating securities that shall be included in the two class method of computing basic and diluted eps 
the fsp does not address awards that contain rights to forfeitable dividends 
the fsp is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january   with early adoption prohibited 
the company does not believe the provisions of fsp eitf will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
funds from operations the company the predecessor year ended december  october  ipo to december  january  to october  year ended december  net income loss minority interests operating partnership depreciation and amortization less non real estate depreciation and amortization ffo available to common stockholders and unitholders 
table of contents funds from operations  or ffo  is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure for reits 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we use ffo as a supplemental performance measure because  in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating expenses 
we also believe that  as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity reits  ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other reits 
however  because ffo excludes real estate related depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of our performance is limited 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo and  accordingly  ffo as disclosed by such other reits may not be comparable to our ffo 
therefore  we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income loss as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or to cash flow from operating activities each as computed in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
related party transactions leasing arrangements as of december   we leased approximately  square feet of office space in washington  dc  an office building owned by entities affiliated with our executive chairman and our president and chief executive officer 
for the year ended december   we paid million under the lease 
we believe that the terms of this lease are fair and reasonable and reflect the terms we could expect to obtain in an arm s length transaction for comparable space elsewhere in washington  dc item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
on august   we entered into a million interest rate swap to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of the credit facility effective august  through the maturity of this loan 
this swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on million of the credit facility at plus the applicable credit spread  which as of december  was fixed at 
we have designated this agreement as a hedge for accounting purposes 
we do not intend to use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and  to the extent we elect to enter into hedging arrangements under the terms of our loan agreement  we intend to enter into contracts with financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
if interest rates were to increase by  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december  excluding the portion of the credit facility that is hedged through our interest rate swap would decrease future income before minority interests and cash flows by approximately million 
table of contents annually less the impact of capitalization on our income before minority interests 
if interest rates were to decrease  the decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt outstanding as of december  would be approximately million annually less the impact of capitalization on our income before minority interests 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure
