table of contents during  supreme continued to experience the impact of the economic recession and the unprecedented tight credit markets  particularly in its core truck business and motorhome operations 
although management foresaw a difficult environment  the downturn has been far more severe than anticipated 
in response  the company has been executing a strategy to navigate through these conditions and position the company to emerge from the current economic environment even stronger 
first and foremost  management has and continues to take costs out of the business  right sizing operations to fit the current market conditions 
in  the annualized cost reductions totaled approximately million with a large component of the saving resulting from our headcount reduction year over year 
while the benefits of these reductions began to emerge in the fourth quarter  the full impact of these savings will be realized in fiscal additionally  management will continue to review its cost structure during and will reduce the size of operations as economic conditions warrant 
however  supreme is committed to invest in both the short and long term as evidenced by the recent introduction of the signature van body which is expected to help our competitiveness in the market 
the new signature van body enables easier and less expensive construction  improved inventory turns  and reduced lead times to deliver the finished product 
the company also invested in the development of an armored suburban under the terms of a contract with the us department of state which calls for up to million of vehicles to be produced over a five year period  subject to periodic orders from the department of state 
supreme s healthy bus business has improved its market share and helped to partially offset the significant downturn in the core dry freight truck business 
to meet increased customer demand  the company has recently expanded its bus capacity on both the east and west coasts to better serve these markets 
the company and its product offerings are sensitive to various factors which include  but are not limited to  economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  changes in governmental regulations  and volatility in the supply chain of vehicle chassis 
the company s business is also affected by the availability and costs of certain raw materials that serve as significant components of its product offerings 
the company s risk factors are disclosed in item a risk factors of this document 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  located at item of this document 
results of operations comparison of with net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily related to our truck body sales  our largest product group  which declined by million 
our armored truck division and composite division experienced a decline in net sales of million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in net sales by our startrans bus divisions of million  or  to million for the year ended december  our silver crown division experienced a slight increase in net sales of million for the year ended december  the following table presents the components of net sales and the changes from to s omitted change specialized vehicles trucks buses armored vehicles motorhomes composites 
table of contents we attribute the decrease in our truck product sales to the economic recession which resulted in an industry wide decline in the retail truck market 
the decline in the truck market began in early  and the prevailing expectation is that it will likely continue until at least additionally  truck products were negatively impacted in the first half of the year by the cancellation of approximately million of orders from a major fleet customer due to the disruption in the supply of general motors gm chassis resulting from a labor dispute between the united auto workers and gm s axle supplier 
this labor dispute was settled in the second quarter  although returning to normal conditions was further delayed by a second labor strike against a chassis delivery provider which has since been resolved 
the disruption adversely affected our profitability and resulted in excess inventory carrying costs for both our fleet and retail business during the first half of we anticipate that the decrease in our truck business activity will create pent up demand and we are poised to capitalize on the eventual expected recovery 
the armored division sales decline was the result of the economic environment and the highly competitive nature of the cash in transit business 
we believe that the armored division is well positioned to increase its revenue in as a result of the us department of state contract mentioned above 
our startrans bus division continues to experience strong demand resulting from increased use of mass transit due to the volatility of fuel prices and increased ridership as more individuals conserve energy to live a green life style 
our total sales backlog was million at december  compared to million at december  cost of sales and gross profit gross profit decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the following table presents the components of cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and the changes from to percent change material direct labor overhead delivery cost of sales gross profit material material cost as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended december  when compared to the corresponding period in the change in the material percentage is primarily related to higher raw material costs and product mix 
our change in product mix relates to our bus division  which has a higher material percentage  and accounted for a of our total sales in compared to for the same period in raw material costs  particularly for aluminum  steel  and petroleum based products  increased in we attempted to address the unavoidable raw material cost increases by increasing the prices of our products to the limited extent that our highly competitive markets permitted 
we announced price increases of and in march and june  respectively  on all core truck product lines 
our startrans bus division implemented price increases of and effective in january and june  respectively 
we also strived to reduce manufacturing costs through the use of technology ie  robotics  innovative materials  etc  lean manufacturing  and improved processes 
these ongoing efforts  as well as product diversification and the introduction of our signature van body  should help us to mitigate the effect of any future increases in raw material costs 
direct labor direct labor as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended december  when compared to the corresponding period in the slight increase in the direct labor percentage was the result of inefficiencies resulting from the labor strikes as discussed previously  timing of fleet customer buying patterns  and the normal startup costs of additional production lines to fulfill fleet orders 

table of contents additionally  our startrans bus division experienced an increase in its labor percentage due to employee training costs associated with our regional plants bus production line start up costs 
the expanded capacity will improve plant utilization while accelerating delivery to satisfy our bus backlog 
overhead overhead as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended december  when compared to the corresponding period in the majority of the increase in the overhead percentage was due to the fixed nature of certain expenses that do not fluctuate when sales volume changes 
the company also experienced higher costs for research and development which was associated with the investments in signature van body and the armored suburban contract 
during  the company reduced its cost and is benefiting from changes to its group health insurance plan design 
additionally  the company s continued safety efforts decreased our workers compensation expense year over year as additional programs were implemented 
we continue to focus on reducing expenses and managing our overhead cost structure based on our level of sales volume 
delivery delivery as a percentage of net sales increased for the year ended december  when compared to the corresponding period in the company continues to research and utilize more cost effective delivery methods to reduce the adverse impact of volatile fuel costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative g a expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the following table presents selling and g a expenses as a percentage of net sales and the changes from to percent change selling expenses g a expenses total selling expenses selling expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the investment in training costs  literature  promotion and advertising expenses resulting from the new signature van body 
partially offsetting this increase is a reduction in commission expense resulting from the lower sales volume in when compared to g a expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower incentive compensation accruals as a result of the decrease in pretax income 
additionally  we incurred one time professional fees during related to complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of intangible asset impairments in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
additionally  the company determined that a customer list totaling approximately million at december   which was associated with the acquisition of pony xpress  llc  was fully impaired 
goodwill goodwill was tested for impairment at december  and due primarily to the depressed market price of the company s class a common stock and consequent difference between the market capitalization and book value of the company  management recorded an impairment charge against the full balance of this asset in the fourth quarter of intangible assets in connection with a business acquisition of pony xpress  llc  in february  the company acquired a customer list totaling approximately million 
due to the 
table of contents significant downturn in the economy  motorhome industry  and selected customers financial positions  the company recorded an impairment charge against the remaining balance of this asset in the fourth quarter of as a result of total impairment  no future amortization expense will be recorded against this intangible asset 
other income for the year ended december   other income was million of net sales compared to million of net sales for the year ended december  other income consisted of rental income  gain on sale of assets  and other miscellaneous income received by the company through its various business activities 
this increase is primarily the result of gains recognized on the sale of two service and distribution centers 
the closure of the service and distribution centers resulted from the company s continued strategy to maximize efficiency through streamlined operations and reduced costs 
interest expense interest expense was million of net sales for the year ended december  compared to million of net sales for the year ended december  this decrease in interest expense reflects lower prevailing interest rates coupled with lower working capital requirements resulting from lower sales volume 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the estimated effective income tax rate for both periods was favorably impacted by tax benefits associated with the company s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  federal alternative fuel tax credits  and research and development tax credits 
the substantially lower pretax income for fiscal resulted in a tax benefit position for the company 
net income and earnings per share net income loss decreased by million to million of net sales for the year ended december   from million of net sales for the year ended december  the following table presents basic and diluted earnings loss per share and the changes from to change earnings loss per share basic diluted comparison of with net sales net sales for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to our core dry freight sales  our largest product group  which declined by million  or 
we attributed the decrease in our core dry freight products to continued industry wide softness in the retail truck market 
partially offsetting this decrease were favorable sales contributions from our startrans bus division which experienced a increase to million  and our armored division  which increased over the prior year  to million in additionally  silver crown  one of our specialty product divisions  increased sales to million  a increase  resulting from the increased market penetration of this acquisition 
our total sales backlog was million at december  compared to million at december

however  raw material costs continued to remain a concern as costs increased for aluminum  steel  and petroleum based raw materials 
the company closely monitored and managed all material costs through timely communication and negotiation with key suppliers and continued to make efforts to recover raw material cost increases through the pricing of our products 
the company also continued to strive to reduce the costs of its products through research into innovative materials and the use of robotics 
historically  the company has experienced and recorded both favorable and unfavorable physical inventory adjustments 
due to our product diversity  complexity  customization  and on line engineering  inventory relief using standard bills of material does not provide full relief of our inventory 
therefore  the company records an additional cost relief adjustment based on various factors 
in addition  the company intensified its bills of material accuracy initiatives and cost relief systems and methods in conjunction with performing additional interim physical inventories and recording any adjustments relating thereto 
in  the company recorded favorable inventory adjustments of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a million favorable inventory adjustment 
in  the company improved its bills of materials accuracy without changing its cost relief adjustment to account for these improvements resulting in a favorable inventory adjustment for the year 
the more frequent physical inventories  and the continued improvements from the process improvement initiatives  should enable the company to continue to minimize the physical inventory adjustments see inventory relief below in our discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates 
direct labor direct labor as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the direct labor improvement was the result of the efficiencies realized from contracting fewer  more costly temporary workers at our core truck divisions due to reduced sales volume 
additionally  in the first half of we experienced a delay in oem supplied chassis which caused the company to temporarily suspend production  thereby negatively affecting labor and overhead absorption 
as noted earlier  while our startrans bus division and silver crown division material content is higher than our core truck products  the labor percentage is lower in these divisions further reducing the overall company labor percentage as a result of the our change in product mix for overhead overhead as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in overall  the company was able to effectively manage its cost structure to the lower sales volume experienced in however  our group health insurance expense increased when compared to to combat the increase in group health insurance  the company continued to implement changes to its group health insurance plan design in an effort to control future claim costs 
the company continues to focus on reducing expenses and managing our overhead cost structure based on our level of sales volume

these credits  determined solely by programs established by the chassis manufacturers  were used to offset marketing and promotional expenses 
additionally  sales commission expense decreased due to the lower sales volume experienced during compared to g a expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to non recurring fees associated with complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of other income other income remained relatively constant at million for the year ended december  and december  other income consisted of rental income  gain on sale of assets  and other miscellaneous income received by the company through its various business activities 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to million of net sales for the year ended december  compared to million of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was due to less borrowing under the company s working capital line of credit and a decrease in chassis interest expense 
the decrease in bank interest expense also reflected lower prevailing interest rates  coupled with an increased focus on working capital management and managing our working capital levels in accordance with the lower sales volume experienced in additionally  the decrease in chassis interest expense was due to reduced consigned chassis inventory levels relating to light duty chassis 
in  we experienced an unanticipated slowdown in the light duty truck market causing a build up of consigned chassis inventory which resulted in increased chassis interest expense 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the effective income tax rates for both years were favorably impacted by tax exempt underwriting income of our wholly owned small captive insurance subsidiary  by the additional tax deduction allowed manufacturers under the american jobs creation act  federal alternative fuel tax credits  and federal and state research and development tax credits

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  inventory relief  accrued insurance  accrued warranty  and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue when products are shipped to the customer 
revenue on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions is recognized after the customer is notified that the products have been completed according to customer specifications  have passed all of the company s quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery based on established delivery terms 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would adversely affect our future operating results 
excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of raw materials and finished products and provide for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand  and or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would adversely affect future operating results 
inventory relief for monthly and quarterly financial reporting  cost of sales is recorded and inventories are relieved by the use of standard bills of material adjusted for scrap and other estimated factors affecting inventory relief 
because of our large and diverse product line and the customized nature of each order  it is difficult to place 
table of contents full reliance on the bills of material for accurate relief of inventories 
although the company continues to refine the process of creating accurate bills of materials  manual adjustments which are based on estimates are necessary in an effort to assure correct relief of inventories for products sold 
the calculations to estimate costs not captured in the bill of materials take into account the customized nature of products  historical inventory relief percentages  scrap variances  and other factors which could impact inventory relief 
the accuracy of the inventory relief is not fully known until physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s locations 
we conduct semi annual physical inventories at all locations and schedule them in a manner that provides coverage in each of our calendar quarters 
we have invested significant resources in our continuing effort to improve the physical inventory process and accuracy of our inventory accounting system 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier  and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates  and any subsequent changes in estimates  may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future 
the company utilizes a wholly owned small captive insurance company to insure certain of its business risks 
certain risks  traditionally self insured by the company and its subsidiaries  are insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
the captive insurance subsidiary helps the company manage its risk exposures and  under the internal revenue code  the net underwriting income of such a small captive is not taxable 
accrued warranty the company provides limited warranties for periods of up to five years from the date of retail sale 
estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time of sale and are based upon historical experience 
impairment of goodwill the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flows approach and consideration of the company s aggregate market value of its common stock 
as of december   the carrying amount of the company s specialized vehicles reporting unit exceeded its fair value  which required a measurement of the impairment loss 
the impairment loss was calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the company determined there was no excess fair value over the amount assigned to the reporting unit s other assets and liabilities 
an impairment loss was recognized for the full carrying value of the goodwill  which totaled  at december  impairment of intangible assets the company evaluates the recoverability of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset 
the company measures the carrying amount of the asset against the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company estimated the value of its customer list based on various valuation techniques  including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires the company to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts 
the company recorded an impairment charge for the full carrying amount of its customer list acquired in during the fourth quarter of  which totaled

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary the cost of investing  financing  and operating 
the company s primary risk exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
in an effort to manage risk exposures  the company strives to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions 
the company s revolving line of credit is floating rate debt and bears interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus certain basis points depending on the pricing option selected and the company s leverage ratio 
at december   the company had in effect an interest rate swap agreement dated july  the interest rate swap agreement is a contract to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the interest rate swap agreement and is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure of credit loss 
the differential paid or received under the interest rate swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the following is a summary of the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  notional amount fixed rate maturity july  based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of december   would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period
