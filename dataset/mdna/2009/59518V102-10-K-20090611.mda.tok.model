the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report  and with other factors described from time to time in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in part i  item a risk factors above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview we develop  manufacture and market implantable and disposable medical devices used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases 
our products are used by interventional neuroradiologists  interventional neurologists and neurosurgeons to treat both cerebral aneurysms responsible for hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial atherosclerosis which may lead to ischemic stroke 
hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke are both significant causes of death and disability worldwide 
our product lines consist of endovascular systems that enable a physician to gain access to the brain in a minimally invasive manner through the vessels of the arterial system 
we believe that our products provide a safe and reliable alternative to more invasive neurosurgical procedures for treating aneurysms 
our proprietary three dimensional  embolic coils anatomically conform and rapidly deploy within an aneurysm  forming a scaffold that conforms to a wide diversity of aneurysm shapes and sizes 
we also supply accessories for use with our microcoils and other products for the treatment of neurovascular disease including microcatheters  balloon catheters  guidewires and stents 
we plan on growing our business by continuing to penetrate our existing hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke markets  bringing new products and technologies to interventional neuroradiologists  interventional neurologists and neurosurgeons  and by entering new geographic territories such as asia where we commenced selling our products in japan through our distribution partner  goodman  in march we also plan to market our products in china upon receiving regulatory approvals 
our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our microcoils 
we also sell stents  access products and accessories for use with our microcoils  which accounted for approximately  and of our revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
geographically  our revenues are generally from sales to customers in the americas  europe and asia 
our products are shipped from our facilities in the united states  switzerland  the united kingdom  and a logistics facility in the netherlands  to either hospitals or distributors 
in select hospitals  our products are held on consignment  and remain on site  free of charge until used 
revenue is generally recognized upon shipment after the receipt of a purchase order 
in arrangements which specify the title transfer upon delivery  revenue is not recognized until the product is delivered 
in the case of consigned goods  revenue is recognized when a replenishment order is made 
we anticipate that our cost of goods sold will generally increase in absolute dollars during those quarters in which our sales increase or we incur additional manufacturing costs in anticipation of the commercial introduction of new products 
furthermore  our gross margin percentage may decrease in those quarters in which we initiate sales of new products or product lines  or enter new geographic territories 
our gross margin percentage may also decrease in those quarters in which we have a higher proportion of sales to distributors with lower average selling prices 
our product development efforts are primarily focused on expanding our product offerings for the hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke markets 
in august  we introduced our cerecyte microcoil product line and we have launched ten new products in the last months  including microcoils  stents  microcatheters  guidewires and balloon catheters 
during fiscal  we launched the neuropath guide catheter  which combines robust proximal support with a highly flexible and visible tip designed to facilitate atraumatic vascular access 
the neuropath guide catheter is used as a conduit for delivery of the microcatheter or other devices  such as coils  stents and balloons  to the aneurysm 
we intend to continue to pursue this non embolic product line expansion with the goal of increasing our revenue opportunity per procedure 
we also launched cerecyte and stretch resistant versions of our deltapaq microcoil system for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms 
our deltapaq microcoil system is designed to enable physicians to achieve greater coil packing density within the aneurysm which may reduce the rate of recanalization and the need for re treatment 
the deltapaq microcoil system supplements our framing and finishing coils in the filling segment of the coil market 
additionally  we launched the pharos vitesse intracranial stent for commercial distribution in the european union and all other countries recognizing the ce mark 
the pharos vitesse is our second generation balloon expandable stent for intracranial ischemic stenosis and wide neck aneurysm treatment 
we have received fda conditional approval of our investigational device exemption for the pharos vissit study 
the vissit study is the first industry sponsored  randomized  prospective clinical trial designed to compare the clinical outcomes between patients who are stented for intracranial ischemic stenosis versus treated with medical therapy 
we are in the process of initiating study sites in the united states  europe and china 

table of contents we intend to continue to expand our direct sales force in north america  europe and asia as necessary and further increase our presence in the asian markets through distributors 
in march  we launched our sales and marketing efforts in japan through our distribution partner  goodman 
in december  we received regulatory approval to sell our stretch resistant microcoils in japan  and in july  we received regulatory approval to sell our cerecyte microcoils in japan 
we recorded product sales to goodman of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to begin selling our products in china upon receiving regulatory approvals 
the timing of these approvals is uncertain due to a pending review by the chinese state food and drug administration sfda of drug and medical device approvals granted during the term of the former sfda minister 
we believe that this review process  along with more stringent approval procedures  will delay review and approval of applications for new products 
as a result  we did not recognize revenues from sales in china during fiscal and we may not recognize revenues from china in fiscal we currently anticipate that the broadening of our product line and our further expansion into the asian market will be primarily funded with our currently available cash and cash expected to be generated from operations 
we introduced our first proprietary  three dimensional microcoil in may our revenues have grown from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we have incurred annual net losses since our inception  including net losses of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we achieved our first profitable quarter of million as a result of our revenue growth and expense management  and we expect to achieve profitability for the full year in fiscal as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we believe that our current cash position and the cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
there is no assurance that we will continue to be profitable in the foreseeable future as we expand our research and development  manufacturing  and sales activities and expand geographically 
as of march   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
recent developments on september   we entered into a settlement and license agreement the settlement and license agreement with boston scientific corporation and target therapeutics  inc  a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation collectively boston scientific and a settlement and release agreement the settlement and release agreement with the regents of the university of california the regents in order to resolve pending patent litigation between boston scientific and us the patent litigation 
on october   the court entered an order dismissing the patent litigation with prejudice 
for further discussion of the settlement and license agreement  please see patent litigation under item legal proceedings  above 
on november   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank to provide us with a revolving line of credit the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for maximum borrowings in the amount of up to million 
if borrowings under the credit agreement exceed million  all borrowings are subject to a borrowing base which is based on eligible accounts receivable 
borrowings are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our assets except for certain permitted liens that are senior to the bank s security interest 
at our option  borrowings bear interest at either over the bank s prime rate or over the one month  two month or three month libor 
the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain financial and other covenants for borrowings to be permitted 
the more significant financial covenants include i a minimum modified quick ratio and ii a minimum profitability  excluding certain non cash items 
on may   we amended the credit agreement with wells fargo bank extending the maturity date to august  and adjusting the minimum limits for the financial covenants based on our financial forecast for fiscal on january   we merged mdt into micrus endovascular corporation 
on july   we entered into a technology transfer agreement with vascular fx  a delaware limited liability company vascular fx  pursuant to which we purchased the intellectual property of vascular fx 
the transaction included a cash purchase price of million paid at closing followed by milestone payments of million paid on january and may   and royalty payments on potential future product sales 
there are no future milestone payments to vascular fx under the terms of the agreement 

table of contents on january   we amended the technology transfer agreement with vascular fx to modify the royalty provision and eliminate the claw back provisions that would have required us to license back the acquired technology to vascular fx under certain circumstances 
under the amended agreement  we will pay vascular fx a royalty equal to of the aggregate net sales of deflectable catheter products sold during the royalty period subject to the mandatory minimum provision not less than  per year 
the royalty period is six years beginning from november  results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations  expressed as percentages of revenues  for the fiscal years ended march   and years ended march  consolidated statements of operations data revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses loss from operations interest and investment income interest expense other income expense  net loss before income taxes income tax benefit net loss fiscal years ended march  and revenues years ended march  change in thousands  except percentages americas europe excluding the united kingdom united kingdom asia pacific our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our microcoils used in the treatment of cerebral vascular diseases 
the overall increase in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the number of microcoil products sold 
factors driving the increase included growth in the overall market for embolic coils  an increase in market share in both the americas and asia pacific  and the introduction of new products 

table of contents revenues from the americas increased to million and revenues from europe increased to million  both compared to fiscal revenues from the united kingdom decreased to million as compared with million for fiscal  primarily due to the unfavorable impact on revenues from the weakening of the british pound against the us dollar 
revenues from asia pacific increased to million and included product sales to our distributor in japan of million  compared with revenues of million for fiscal which included sales to our distributor in japan of million 
we plan to begin selling our products in china upon receiving regulatory approvals 
we did not recognize revenues from sales to china during fiscal revenues from latin america increased to million in fiscal compared with revenues of million in fiscal due to an overall increase in product sales to our distributors in the region and a change in our revenue recognition policy for sales made to latin american distributors from a cash collection basis to upon shipment basis see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in
