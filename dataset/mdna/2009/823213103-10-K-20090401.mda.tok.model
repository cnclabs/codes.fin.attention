item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading and fast growing chinese manufacturer of specialty additives 
our npcc products are used as functional additives in various products due to their special chemical and physical attributes 
as a market leader of high grade npcc products  we use advanced processing technology to convert limestone into high quality npcc products  which are sold to our customers in the tire  polyvinyl chloride pvc building materials  ink  paint  latex  adhesive  paper and polyethylene pe industries 
prior to november  we also manufactured  marketed and sold coal based chemical products  namely  ammonium bicarbonate  liquid ammonia  methanol and melamine 
we marketed and sold coal based chemical products mainly as chemical fertilizers and raw materials for the production of organic and inorganic chemical products  including formaldehyde and pesticides 
reorganization we were organized as a nevada corporation on may  under the name zeolite exploration company for the purpose of acquiring  exploring and developing mineral properties 
we conducted no material operations from the date of our organization until march on march   we consummated a share exchange pursuant to a securities purchase agreement and plan of reorganization with faith bloom limited  a british virgin islands company  and its stockholders 
as a result of the share exchange  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of faith bloom in exchange for a total of  shares of our common stock 
the share exchange is accounted for as a recapitalization of zeolite and resulted in a change in our fiscal year end from july to december faith bloom limited was deemed to be the accounting acquiring entity in the share exchange and  accordingly  the financial information included in this annual report reflects the operations of faith bloom  as if faith bloom had acquired us 
faith bloom was organized on november  for the purpose of acquiring from eastern nanomaterials pte 
ltd  a singapore corporation  all of the capital shares of shandong haize nanomaterials co  ltd and shandong bangsheng chemical co  ltd  which are chinese corporations engaged in the manufacture  marketing and sales of a variety of npcc products and coal based chemicals for use in various applications 
on december   faith bloom acquired all of the capital shares of shandong haize nanomaterials co  ltd and shandong bangsheng chemical co  ltd 
as a result of the transactions described above  shandong haize nanomaterials co  ltd and shandong bangsheng chemical co  ltd 
are wholly owned subsidiaries of faith bloom  and faith bloom is a wholly owned subsidiary of zeolite 
on april   faith bloom formed a wholly owned subsidiary in shaanxi  china to run the new npcc facility in shaanxi 
effective january   zeolite changed its name to shengdatech  inc on july   faithbloom formed a wholly owned subsidiary in zibo  shandong to operate our new npcc facility in zibo  which is currently under construction 
our corporate structure is depicted in the following chart net sales we derive our net sales from the sale of our npcc products 
prior to november  we derived our sales of products from two segments npcc and coal based chemicals 
the most significant factors that directly or indirectly affect our sales are as follows manufacturing capacity of npcc  breakthroughs of r d and applications of npcc  pricing of our npcc products  actions of competitors  industry demand  and exchange rate manufacturing capacity of npcc 
we increased our annual manufacturing capacity of npcc from  metric tons as of december  to  metric tons as of december   and to  metric tons as of september  and to current  metric tons as of december  increasing capacity allows us to provide a stable supply of npcc to our existing customers  attract new customers and increase our sale of products 
breakthroughs of research and development and applications of npcc 
in conjunction with tsinghua university  we successfully completed the development of the membrane dispersion technology for npcc production  which was officially granted a patent in november with the membrane dispersion patent and the continuing efforts of our r d department in developing new npcc products for applications in different industries  we believe that we maintain a leading position in technology for the npcc market in china 
pricing of our npcc products 
the pricing of our npcc products is generally determined by manufacturing costs  overall market demand  competition and  increasingly  costs associated with technology 
in addition  the pricing of some of our npcc products depends on the amount of cost saving that a particular industry or customer can achieve 
for example  with respect to tire and pvc building materials  the pricing of npcc products is principally affected by the cost saving benefit our customers realize by replacing some of the relatively expensive carbon black and silicon dioxide with less expensive npcc 
with respect to paper  the pricing of npcc is principally affected by comparable imports 
in the next few years  we may reduce the selling price in order to compete with relatively small competitors 
industry demand 
our business and sales of products growth depend on the industry demand of npcc 
the downstream industries we supply are the tire  pvc and pe building materials  paper  rubber  paints and oil ink industries 
given the diverse application of our npcc products and the development of our r d pipeline to cater to new end markets  we believe that our business has potential for continued growth 
exchange rate 
our sales of products has been affected by the foreign exchange rate between usd and rmb because the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries in the prc is rmb while our financial statements have been expressed in usd  which is the functional currency of shengdatech  inc the accompanying consolidated statements of income have been translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during each of the periods presented 
prior to november  sales from our coal based chemical business were derived from sale of ammonia based chemicals  namely  ammonium bicarbonate  liquid ammonia  methanol and melamine  to local farmers and chemical plants located in shandong and other surrounding provinces 
on june   the tai an city government  as part of china s strengthening of environmental law enforcement reform  issued a notice directing bangsheng chemical facility  our coal based chemical facility in tai an city  to cease production due to the close proximity of our facility to residential and non manufacturing business properties 
in accordance with the tai an city government s notice  we ceased production at our bangsheng chemical facility on october  our coal based chemical business generally experienced a seasonal peak between march and november of each year  when our ammonium bicarbonate is in high demand due to the farming season in northern china 
december to february was typically the low season for our coal based chemicals business  during which the price of our ammonium bicarbonate may drop approximately to 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold for npcc and  prior to november  coal based chemicals consists primarily of a consumption of raw materials and auxiliary raw materials b use of water and electricity c machinery s depreciation and d workers salaries 
the most significant factors that directly or indirectly affect our cost of goods sold are as follows processing technologies for npcc  cost of transporting raw material  supply and price of limestone  availability and price of coal  supply and price of electricity  and fluctuations in the rmb to usd exchange rate process technologies for npcc 
the advancement of npcc processing technologies is crucial in order to deliver value to our clients 
in conjunction with tsinghua university  we successfully completed the development of a more advanced membrane dispersion technology  which was officially granted a patent in november we and tsinghua university each have a ownership share of the technology  we have the exclusive right to use the technology under a license agreement with tsinghua university for the life of the patent 
the new membrane dispersion technology will enable us to produce npcc in a more efficient and cost effective way 
supply and price of limestone 
limestone is an important raw material for npcc 
our shaanxi facility is in proximity to a high quality limestone quarry  which enables us to minimize transportation cost of limestone 
we maintain a strong relationship with our mining contractor which conducts extracting activities for us 
in addition  on june   we entered into an investment agreement with the zibo high tech industrial development zone management committee the management committee 
the management committee will initially sell to us approximately million metric tons of supply sources of good quality limestone  with the sale and transfer of the mining rights to the company to be completed within months 
availability and price of coal 
coal is the key raw material used to produce our coal based chemicals and is also used in the production of our npcc products as a key fuel for the calcination of limestone 
we have long term relationships with our coal suppliers 
we have also developed a network of alternative suppliers for backup purposes 
coal prices have fluctuated in the past few years 
the average price of coal was approximately per metric ton in and increased to approximately per metric ton in and per metric ton in in  it was approximately per metric ton and increased to per metric ton in supply and price of electricity 
electricity from the grid is the primary power source for the production of npcc and coal based chemicals  and  it is currently supplied by the local government 
in the past few years  as the government supports supplies to the farming industry  for our coal based chemicals  we have enjoyed a price discount on electricity of up to a of the price of electricity for industrial users 
as demand for coal based chemical products increased  the chinese government increased the price of electricity for the coal based chemical industry from kwh in to kwh in  while the price of electricity for the npcc industry increased from kwh in to kwh in fluctuations in the rmb to usd exchange rate 
our cost of products sold has been affected by the foreign exchange rate between usd and rmb because the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries in the prc is rmb while our financial statements have been expressed in usd  which is the functional currency of shengdatech  inc 
the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income have been translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during each of the periods presented 
gross profit our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our products  b the average selling price of our products  which in turn depends in part on the mix of products sold  c new product introductions  d the volume and costs of manufacturing of our products and e competitive activity 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling and general and administrative expenses 
selling expenses consists primarily of a salaries of sales personnel  b sales commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  and d other related overhead 
we expect our selling expenses to increase in the future as we further increase our sales 
in the second quarter of  we lowered the commission rate to sales staff from to  as the volume of sales of our npcc business increased 
as a result  we plan to employ more sales staff and pay more commission based on growing sales 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of a salaries of administrative and r d personnel  b labor union fees  c insurance fees  d lease payments for housing and property  e expenses related to being a public company and f other related expenses 
we expect general and administrative expense to continue to increase 
being a publicly traded company  we will incur additional expenses related to costs of compliance with securities and other regulations  including increased audit and legal fees and investor relations expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the selection of critical accounting policies  the judgments and other uncertainties affecting application of those policies and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions are factors to be considered when reviewing our financial statements 
our principal accounting policies are set forth in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenues from the sale of products when they are realized and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues are not recognized until products have been shipped to the client except for our exported products  for which title transfers at the customer s port  risk of loss has transferred to the client and client acceptance has been obtained  client acceptance provisions have lapsed  or we have objective evidence that the criteria specified in client acceptance provisions have been satisfied 
we sell all products to end users and recognize revenues  net with sales rebates and taxes  when the products are shipped 
we have no post delivery obligations on our products sold 
valuation of long lived assets the carrying values of our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may not be recoverable 
when such an event occurs  we project the undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition over the remaining life of the asset 
if projections were to indicate that the carrying value of the long lived asset will not be recovered  the carrying value of the long lived asset is reduced by the estimated excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value 
on june   the tai an city government  as part of china s strengthening of environmental law enforcement reform  issued a notice directing bangsheng chemical facility to cease production due to the close proximity of our coal based chemical facility to residential and non manufacturing business properties 
in accordance with the tai an city government s notice  we ceased production at our bangsheng chemical facility on october  as a result  our operating expenses for the year ended december  had an impairment of equipment of approximately million 
results of operations comparison for the years ended december  and sales of products for the year ended december  period to period change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount chemical npcc net sales the sales of products of our coal based chemical business increased by  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was mainly due to additional revenue of  as a result of the increased price of ammonium bicarbonate by per ton  which was offset by the decreased sales volume by  tons  additional revenue of  as a result of the increased price of methanol by per ton  which was offset by the decreased sales volume by  tons  additional revenue of  as a result of the increased price of liquid ammonia by per ton  which was offset by the decreased sales volume by  tons  additional revenue of  as a result of the increased price of ammonia by per ton  which was offset by the decreased sales volume by tons  additional revenue of  as a result of the increased price of melamine by per ton  which was offset by the decreased sales volume by  tons 
the decreases in sales volume was due to the fact that our bangsheng chemical facility was mandated to stop production in october as it was located in designated residential and non manufacturing business zones based on the local government s enhanced urban safety and environment standard 
the increase in net sales from our npcc business was  or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was mainly due to the increase of sales volume and price by  tons and per ton  respectively as a result of our capacity expansion and increase in demand 
on august   the company entered into an agreement with shangdong shengda  a related party  to acquire a state owned company  jinan fertilizer co 
ltd 
jinan fertilizer in an effort to consolidate the bangsheng chemical facility operations with jinan fertilizer 
in march  the company decided not to pursue the acquisition of jinan fertilizer 
the agreement expires by its terms on march  with no liability to the company 
the company intends to continue its chemical operations and is currently seeking strategic opportunities to continue its chemical operations

the cost of goods sold for our npcc business increased by  or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this increase was mainly due to i an additional  because of increased sales volume as a result of our npcc capacity expansion  ii an additional  from the increase in the production cost of per ton as the result of the increase in the price of raw materials 
our gross margin of npcc decreased from to 
this was mainly due to an increase in the products sales cost of per ton as the result of the price increase of anthracite and soft coal by and  respectively 
however  there was an increase of gross profit by  or due to the increase in sales volume 
operating expenses for the year ended december  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses selling expenses general and administrative expenses impairment of property  plant and equipment total operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the main reason was sales commission increased by  as a result of the increase of sales 
general and administrative expense increased by  or for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the main reasons were i an increase of taxes of  paid in the form of land use tax to the government as the result of the establishment of our zibo npcc facility  ii the increase of  in the depreciation charge of our r d center and an amortization charge of  for land use rights newly acquired in zibo  iii an increase of  as a result of increase in headcount as well as salary increases  iv an increase of  in r d expenses  v charges of  in compensation for staff as the result of the cessation of production at our bangsheng chemical facility  vi the increase of  in listing and professional fees as a result of changing our auditors and the issuance of our convertible notes and  in accrued counsel fee  and vii the decrease of operating expenses of  due to the cease of production at our bangsheng chemical facility 
due to the cessation of production at our bangsheng chemical facility  the carrying amount of the plant equipment was reduced to the fair value based on estimated selling price in the used equipment market 
this resulted in an impairment loss of fixed asset of  for the year ended december  operating income and earnings before income taxes for the year ended december  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating income interest income gain on extinguishment of long term convertible notes other expense interest expense earning before income tax interest income for the year ended december  decreased by  or  which was mainly due to a decrease in bank deposit interest rates 
gain on extinguishment of long term convertible notes for the year ended december  was  which was mainly due to the gain from our repurchase of million face amount of our convertible notes 
other expense for the year ended december  increased by  which was mainly to the increase in foreign exchange currency losses arising from our overseas sales 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  which mainly resulted from our interest bearing convertible notes issued in comparison for the years ended december  and sales of products for the year ended december  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount sales of products chemical npcc net sales net sales of our coal based chemical business increased by  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was mainly due to i an additional  from an increase in sales of liquid ammonia and melamine by  tons and tons  respectively  and an increase in average sales price per ton of and  respectively  which was offset by  from a decrease in sales of ammonium bicarbonate by  tons  and ii an decrease of  from the sale of surplus heat from our production process to the heat supply department of the local government 
the increase in sales for certain coal based chemical products and the decrease in sales for other coal based chemical products were caused by the adjustment of our product mix due to market conditions 
for example  from december to february  the demand for our ammonium bicarbonate may be weaker while the demand for methanol may be stronger as compared to the rest of year 
the increase in total revenue from our npcc business was  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the increase was mainly due to i an additional  in revenue from an increase in sales volume of  tons as a result of our capacity expansion and ii an additional  due to the rmb s appreciation against the usd 
cost of goods sold and gross profits for the year ended december  change amount of total segment revenue amount of total segment revenue amount cost of goods sold chemical npcc total cost of goods sold gross profit chemical npcc total gross profit the cost of goods sold of our coal based chemical business increased by  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year

the cost of goods sold of our npcc business increased by  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
this was mainly due to an increase of  in cost from increased production volume as a result of our npcc capacity expansion in shaanxi 
our gross margin of npcc increased from to for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  gross profit increased by  or  primarily due to the introduction of new technology and the expansion of capacity with lower cost of raw materials in our new facility in shaanxi 
operating expenses for the year ended december  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses selling expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the main reasons were an increase of  in sales commissions paid as a result of the increase of sales and increased salary and insurance expenses of general and administrative expenses increased by  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the main reasons were i an increase of  in expenses related to consulting fees for compliance with sarbanes oxley regulations sox and other consulting fees  ii an increase of  in depreciation of our research and development centre  and iii an increase of  in salary expenses as a result of staff increase  which were offset by a decrease of  in technology testing and research and development fees as well as office  business and entertainment fees 
the decrease in technology testing and research and development expense was primarily due to the implementation of the new membrane dispersion technology co owned by us and tsinghua university and ceasing the payment of licensing fees for our previously used ultra gravity technology 
operating income and earnings before income tax for the year ended december  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating income interest income non operating expense earnings before income taxes interest income for the year ended december  increased by  or  as compared to the prior year 
this increase resulted from an increase in net cash 
non operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by  mainly because of less exchange loss and no loss from disposition of damaged and outdated equipment being incurred in liquidity and capital resources as of and for the year ended december  amount cash accounts receivable  net working capital cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities we believe  based on our current cash levels as well as the operating cash flows expected in  that we will have sufficient funds to finance our current operations for at least the next months 
however  we have also planned additional capital expenditures in the next months to expand business 
we anticipate that these expenditures will be funded from working capital and financing activities 
we believe that the capital expenditures may influenced by changes and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds for such capital expenditures 
cash 
our cash was held for capital expenditures  strategic investment and working capital purposes 
as of december   our cash balance was  as compared to  as of december  the increase was primarily due to the convertible notes issued in may and positive cash flow from operations partly offset with investment in property  plant and equipment 
we did not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
the fluctuations vary depending on the timing of our shipping and billing activity and cash collections 
accounts receivable turnover in days were days in  days in and days in we established a credit policy granting a day credit term in to standardize customers 
as of december   there were no overdue accounts receivable 
working capital 
our working capital balance fluctuates from period to period  which is affected by our cash flow from operating activities 
working capital increased significantly by  from  as of december  to  as of december  due to the increased cash from issuing of convertible notes 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of our cash receipts from product sales and equipment and the effect of changes in working capital and other operating activities 
a primary factor affecting our operating cash flow is the timing of the cash receipts of the proceeds from the sales of npcc and coal based chemical products and payments to purchase raw materials 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased by  from  for the year ended december  was primarily because of our increased collection of proceeds from the products sold 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased by  from  for the year ended december  was because of increased production capacity of our npcc facility 
cash used for investing activities for the year ended december  increased by  from  for the year ended december  primarily due to the investment costs in zibo facility 
cash used for investing activates for the year ended december  increased by  was primarily because of the increase in purchase of machinery equipment for shaanxi facility 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   which is mainly due to net proceeds amounting to  from the issuance of convertible notes and offset by cash paid for the repurchase of our convertible notes amounting to  compared with  for the year ended december   which is due to the settlement of amounts due to related party 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   which is mainly due to the proceeds from the issue of common stock 
contractual obligations less than one year years years more than years total convertible notes principal long term convertible notes interest operating lease capital commitments total on june  and june   holders of the notes may require the company to purchase all or a portion of the notes subject to certain conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
our cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital and for the strategic investments and acquisition purposes and consist primarily of bank deposits 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign exchange risk 
although the conversion of the chinese yuan rmb is highly regulated in the prc  the value of the rmb against the value of the us dollar usd or any other currency nonetheless may fluctuate and be affected by  among other things  changes in the political and economic conditions in the prc 
under the currency policy in effect in the prc today  the rmb is permitted to fluctuate in value within a narrow band against a basket of certain foreign currencies 
the prc is currently under significant international pressures to liberalize this government currency policy  and if such liberalization were to occur  the value of the rmb could depreciate against the usd 
the functional currency of our operating subsidiaries in the prc is rmb 
however  the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in usd  which is our functional currency 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets have been translated into usd at the exchange rates prevailing at each balance sheet date 
the accompanying consolidated statements of income have been translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the periods of each statement 
fluctuations in exchange rates may affect our financial results reported in usd terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect our balance sheet 
for example  to the extent that we need to convert us dollars received from the proceeds of a financing into the rmb for our operations  appreciation of the rmb against the usd would have an adverse effect on the rmb amount that we receive from the conversion 
conversely  if we decide to convert our rmb into usd for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our shares or for other business purposes  appreciation of the usd against the rmb would have a negative effect on the us dollar amount available to us 
considering the amount of our cash as of december   a appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar will result in an estimated increase of approximately  in our total amount of cash  and a appreciation of the usd against the rmb will result in a decrease of approximately  in our total amount of cash 
we have not used any forward contracts or currency borrowings to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk and do not currently intend to do so 
interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no short term borrowings 
our interest rate risk mainly related to the convertible senior notes issued with a maturity date of june  however  if we borrow money in future periods  we may be exposed to interest rate risk 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments and believe our exposure to interest rate risk and other relevant market risks is not material 
inflation 
in recent years  the chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation 
during the past three years  the rates of inflation in china were in  in  and in however  because of the recent global economic crisis  the danger of inflation is subsiding 
for example  in december  the rate of inflation in china was only
