general the parent company is a bank holding company founded in and headquartered in jeffersonville  new york 
the parent company owns of the outstanding shares of the bank s common stock and derives substantially all of its income from the bank s operations in the form of dividends paid to the parent company 
the bank is a new york commercial bank chartered in serving sullivan county  new york with branch offices in jeffersonville  eldred  liberty  loch sheldrake  monticello two  livingston manor  narrowsburg  callicoon and wurtsboro 
the bank s administrative offices are located in jeffersonville  new york 
the company s mission is to serve the community banking needs of its borrowers and depositors  who predominantly are individuals  small businesses and local municipal governments 
the company believes it understands its local customer needs and provides quality service with a personal touch 
the financial results of the company are influenced by economic events that affect the communities we serve as well as national economic conditions  primarily interest rates trends  affecting the entire banking industry 
changes in net interest income have the greatest impact on the company s net income 
national economic performance deteriorated significantly in subprime lending problems battered large banks and investment companies  leading to the disappearance of some and direct and indirect government support for others 
the past year witnessed a material drop in market values of new and existing homes 
retail sales levels dropped despite heavy holiday discounting 
furthermore  the us based automobile industry has asked for significant government funding to stay afloat 
locally  our economy is also suffering 
real estate values are declining as the inventory of unsold homes has increased 
the construction industry is negatively affected by the decline in real estate sales and growing inventory of existing housing 
lack of commercial growth also impacts the construction industry  which in turn creates a decline in demand from suppliers of building materials as well as for construction workers 
nevertheless  there are reasons to believe that local economic conditions and employment prospects may not be so severe 
a proposed entertainment city development  a billion dollar project that is expected to incorporate the current racino and harness racing track in monticello  is currently under construction on the site of the former concord resort and may create thousands of construction and permanent jobs in sullivan county 
in addition  some native american tribes have proposed casino gaming projects in sullivan county 
the forthcoming completion of the millennium natural gas pipeline project will create a greatly expanded and bi directional transportation route for local natural gas production and storage 
energy companies are exploring the possibility of drilling into previously unreachable natural gas reserves in western sullivan county thought to contain up to trillion cubic feet of natural gas 
this project is expected to promote economic development in sullivan county 
the company has underwritten loans using the same conservative standards that have been the foundation of the company since its inception 
our overall asset quality remains strong 
management believes the company will weather this economic downturn  as it has survived many others in the past  with sound financial decisions 
critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and values of real estate particularly in sullivan county 
collateral underlying certain real estate loans could lose value which could lead to future additions to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
foreclosed real estate consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or by acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure

operating costs associated with the properties are charged to expense as incurred 
gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate are included in income when title has passed and the sale has met the minimum down payment requirements prescribed by gaap

higher charge off levels in resulted in the provision 
provisions for loan losses are recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
the provision for loan losses was also reduced in due to the reduction in net charge offs as noted below 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  particularly in sullivan county 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
based on management s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio  management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of all or a portion of the principal is unlikely 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized 
total nonperforming loans increased million from million at december  to million at december  net loan recoveries charge offs decreased from  in to  in and gross charge offs increased from  in to  in summary of loan loss experience the following table indicates the amount of charge offs and recoveries in the loan portfolio by category

management strives to identify potential nonperforming loans in a timely basis  take charge offs promptly based on a realistic assessment of probable losses  and maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on the inherent risk of loss in the existing portfolio 
the provision credit for loan losses was  for the year ended december  compared to a credit of  for as disclosed in the company s form k  the company recovered  on a previously written off loan 
this recovery was for a loan made in the loan turned out to be fraudulent and the participants brought a legal suit against the bank of new york 
the participating lenders prevailed and received their settlements in the first quarter of the allowance for loan losses was million at december   million at  and million at the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance s coverage of nonperforming loans was at december  compared to and at december  and respectively 
despite the continuing high levels of nonperforming loans and the downturn in local economic conditions  the bank is and has been committed to common sense lending practices  sacrificing loan quantity for quality 
this policy is reflected in the banks net charge off recovery history in the above table 
while nonperforming loans have increased  the bank s management believes that loans remain well collateralized 
a specific reserve of  has been established to help reduce the risk of nonperforming loans 
no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any loan or group of loans  as the entire allowance is available to absorb charge offs in any loan category 
the amount and timing of future charge offs and allowance allocations may vary from current estimates and will depend on local economic conditions 
the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to major portfolio categories and the percentage of each loan category to total loans outstanding 
commercial nonperforming loans are evaluated individually for impairment in accordance with fas as of december   there were  in loans  compared to  as of december   which were considered to be impaired under sfas no

nonaccrual and past due loans the company places a loan on nonaccrual status when collectability of principal or interest is doubtful  or when either principal or interest is days or more past due and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied as a reduction of the principal balance when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal 
a distribution of nonaccrual loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest is shown in the following table

nonaccrual loans increased million from million at december  to million at december  except for a specific reserve of  allocated to certain nonaccrual loans  the remaining loan balances are well collateralized with interest being recognized as received 
from time to time  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when the company determines that it will ultimately receive greater economic value under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
candidates for renegotiation must meet specific guidelines

however  the nonaccrual loan balances are included in the average amount outstanding 
computed by dividing net interest income by total interest earning assets 
the following schedule sets forth  for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the dollar amount of interest income calculated on a tax equivalent basis and interest expense  and changes therein for as compared to  and as compared to the increase and decrease in interest income and expense due to both rate and volume have been allocated to the two categories of variances volume and rate based on percentage relationships of such variance to each other 
volume and rate analysis compared to compared to increase decrease increase decrease due to change in due to change in volume rate total volume rate total interest income investment securities and securities available for sale short term investments loans total interest income interest expense now and super now deposits savings and insured money market deposits time deposits federal funds purchased and other short term debt long term debt total interest expense net interest income the company s operating results are affected by inflation to the extent that interest rates  loan demand and deposit levels adjust to inflation and impact net interest income 
management can best counter the effect of inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that the bank s management must continually perform to meet the objectives of maintaining stable net interest income and net interest margin 
therefore  prior to setting the term or interest rate on loans or deposits  or before purchasing investment securities or borrowing funds  management must understand the impact alternative interest rates will have on the bank s interest rate risk profile 
this is accomplished through simulation modeling 
simulation modeling is the process of shocking the current balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios and then measuring the impact of interest rate changes on both projected earning and the economic value of the bank s equity 
the estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loan and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement rates on asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based on available information and current economic and general market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the ultimate accuracy of these assumptions including competitive influences and customer behavior 
accordingly  actual results will differ from those predicted by simulation modeling 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from an instantaneous shift in all market interest rates 
the projected changes in net interest income are totals for the month period beginning january  and ending december  under instantaneous shock scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity table dollars in thousands interest rate shock prime rate projected annualized net interest income projected dollar change in net interest income projected percentage change in net interest income projected change in net interest income as a percent of total stockholders equity no change under an instantaneous interest rate shock  interest rates are modeled to change at once 
this is a very conservative modeling technique that illustrates immediate rather than gradual increases or decreases in interest rates 
many assumptions are embedded within our interest rate risk model 
these assumptions are approved by the asset and liability committee and are based upon both management s experience and projections provided by investment securities companies 
assuming our prepayment and other assumptions are accurate and assuming we take reasonable actions to preserve net interest income  we project that net interest income would decline by  or of total stockholders equity in a instantaneous interest rate shock and increase by  or of stockholders equity in a instantaneous interest rate shock 
this is within our asset and liability policy guideline which limits the maximum projected decrease in net interest income in a or instantaneous interest rate shock to of the company s total net interest income 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk is impacted by general market conditions and customer demand 
generally we try to limit the volume and term of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities  so that we can adjust them and pricing of assets and liabilities to mitigate net interest income volatility 
the bank purchases investments for the securities portfolio and borrows from the fhlb of ny to offset interest rate risk taken in the loan portfolio 
the bank also offers adjustable rate loan and deposit products that change as interest rates change 
approximately of the bank s assets at december  were invested in adjustable rate loans and in floating rate investment securities
