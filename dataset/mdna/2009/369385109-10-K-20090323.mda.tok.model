item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the following discussion  general communication  inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we  us and our 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables  unbilled revenues  accrual of the usf high cost area program subsidy  share based compensation  reserve for future customer credits  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  depreciable and amortizable lives of assets  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill  cable certificates and wireless licenses  our effective tax rate  purchase price allocations  the accrual of cost of goods sold  depreciation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
we reclassified million and million of network maintenance and operations expense from selling  general and administrative expense to cost of goods sold for and  respectively 
we believe this change in presentation more closely aligns our maintenance and operations components to the nature of expenses included in our financial statement captions 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in item of this form k 
general overview through our focus on long term results  acquisitions  and strategic capital investments  we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins 
we have historically met our cash needs for operations  regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities 
historically  cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities 
the ongoing weakness in the national economy and credit market turmoil continue to negatively impact consumer confidence and spending 
if these trends continue  they could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could impact our revenue growth 
we believe the alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time 
mortgage foreclosure rates in alaska are the lowest in the nation and the commercial real estate market is steady 
alaska appears to be relatively well positioned to weather recessionary pressures despite the recent steep decline in energy prices 
the state of alaska has large cash reserves that should enable it to maintain its budget for at least the next two fiscal years 
this is important for alaska s economy as the state is the largest employer and second largest source of gross state product 
the majority of our revenue is driven by the strength of the alaska economy which appears relatively well positioned to weather the recessionary pressures  nonetheless we cannot predict the impact the economic crisis may have on us 
our five reportable segments are consumer  network access  commercial  managed broadband and regulated operations 
our reportable segments are business units that offer different products  are each managed separately  and serve distinct types of customers 
the network access segment provides services to other common carrier customers and the managed broadband segment provides services to rural school districts  hospitals and health clinics 
effective june   we purchased of the outstanding stock of uui and unicom 
the financial results of the long distance  local access and internet services sold to consumer and commercial customers of certain of these acquired companies are reported in the regulated operations segment 
the financial results of the long distance services sold to other common carrier customers and the managed broadband services components of certain of these acquired companies are included in the network access and managed broadband services segments  respectively 
effective july   we closed on our purchase of of the ownership interests of alaska wireless whose results are included in the consumer segment 
following are our segments and the services and products each offers to its customers reportable segments services and products consumer network access commercial managed broadband regulated operations voice long distance x x x x local access x x x x directories x video x x data internet x x x x x data networks x x x managed services x x managed broadband services x wireless x x x x an overview of our services and products follows 
voice services and products long distance we generate long distance services revenues from monthly plan fees and usage charges 
factors that have the greatest impact on year to year changes in long distance services revenues include the rate per minute charged to customers and usage volumes expressed as minutes of use 
common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to our common carrier customers by their customers 
pricing pressures  new program offerings  and market and business consolidations continue to evolve in the markets served by our other common carrier customers 
if  as a result  their traffic is reduced  or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in alaska are reduced  our traffic will also likely be reduced  and our pricing may be reduced to respond to competitive pressures  consistent with federal law 
additionally  disruption in the economy resulting from terrorist attacks and other attacks or acts of war could affect our carrier customers 
we are unable to predict the effect on us of such changes 
however  given the materiality of other common carrier revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
due in large part to the favorable synergistic effects of our bundling strategy focused on consumer and commercial customers  long distance services continue to be a significant contributor to our overall performance  although the migration of traffic from our voice products to our data and wireless products continues 
our long distance service faces significant competition from at t alascom  acs  mta  long distance resellers  and certain smaller rural local telephone companies that have entered the long distance market 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing long distance services and bundling different services will continue to allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
local access we generate local access services revenues from four primary sources basic dial tone services  data network and special access services  origination and termination of long distance calls for other common carriers  and features and other charges  including voice mail  caller id  distinctive ring  inside wiring and subscriber line charges 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in local access services revenues include the average number of subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly rates charged for non traffic sensitive services  the number and type of additional premium features selected  the traffic sensitive access rates charged to carriers and amounts received from the usac 
we estimate that our december   and total lines in service represent a statewide market share of  and  respectively 
at december   and  and  respectively  of our lines  including the lines of uui at december   are provided on our own facilities 
our local access service faces significant competition in anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau from acs  which is the largest ilec in alaska  and from alascom in anchorage for consumer services 
alascom has received certification from the rca to provide local access services in fairbanks and juneau 
in the matanuska susitna valley our local access service faces competition from mta  the ilec in this area 
in october  we began offering local access service in the kenai soldotna area and face competition from acs  the ilec in this area 
we compete against other smaller ilecs in certain smaller communities 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing local access services and bundling different services will allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
we are continuing to expand our local access service areas and will offer service in these new areas using a combination of methods 
to a large extent  we plan to use our existing fiber and coaxial cable networks to deliver local access services 
where we do not have our own facilities  we may resell other carriers services  lease portions of an existing carrier s network or seek wholesale discounts 
we plan to continue to deploy dlps lines which utilize our coaxial cable facilities 
this service delivery method allows us to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access service to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
on may   the fcc issued an order adopting the recommendation of the joint board to impose a state by state interim cap on high cost funds to be distributed to competitive etcs 
as part of the revised policy  the fcc adopted a limited exception from the cap for competitive etcs serving tribal lands or alaska native regions 
while the operation of the cap will generally reduce the high cost fund amounts available to competitive etcs as new competitive etcs are designated and as existing competitive etcs acquire new customers  providers like us who serve tribal lands or alaska native regions were provided some relief 
on march   the fcc issued an additional order waiving a previously adopted limitation to the exception  the result of which is to provide uncapped support for all lines served by competitive etcs for tribal lands or alaska native regions during the time the interim cap is in effect 
the uncapped support for tribal lands or alaska native regions and the cap for all other regions will be in place until the fcc takes action on proposals for long term reform 
the joint board has recommended for fcc consideration long term options for reforming usf support  including establishing separate funds for mobility and broadband support 
separately  the fcc has issued two reform proposals for changing the basis for support amounts 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of the fcc proceedings to consider usf reform proposals or their respective impacts on us 
both these and any future regulatory  legislative  or judicial actions could affect the operation of the usf and result in a change in our revenue for providing local access services in new and existing markets and facilities based wireless services in new markets 
uui and its subsidiary  united kuc  which were acquired by us effective june   are ilecs and therefore are subject to regulation by the rca 
uui and united kuc do not face significant competition 
directories we sell advertising in our yellow pages directories to commercial customers  distribute white and yellow pages directories to customers in certain markets we serve  and offer an on line directory 
video services and products we generate cable services revenues from three primary sources digital programming services  including monthly basic and premium subscriptions  pay per view movies  video on demand and one time events  such as sporting events  equipment rentals  and advertising sales 
our cable systems serve communities and areas in alaska  including the state s five largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks  the matanuska susitna valley  the kenai peninsula  and juneau 
we transmit an entirely digital signal for all cable television channels in all markets we serve as of december  the primary factors that contribute to period to period changes in cable services revenues include average monthly subscription rates and pay per view buys  the mix among basic  premium and digital tier services  the average number of cable television subscribers during a given reporting period  set top box utilization and related rates  revenues generated from new product offerings  and sales of cable advertising services 
our cable service offerings are bundled with various combinations of our long distance  local access  and internet services 
value added premium services are available for additional charges 
our cable television systems face competition primarily from alternative methods of receiving and distributing television signals  including dbs and digital video over telephone lines  and other sources of news  information and entertainment  including internet services 
data services and products internet we generate internet services revenues from three primary sources access product services  including cable modem  dial up  and dedicated access  network management services  and wholesale access for other common carriers 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in internet services revenues include the average number of subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly subscription rates  the amount of bandwidth purchased by large commercial customers  and the number and type of additional premium features selected 
marketing campaigns continue to be deployed featuring bundled products 
our internet offerings are bundled with various combinations of our long distance  cable  and local access services and provide free or discounted basic or premium internet services 
value added premium internet features are available for additional charges 
we compete with a number of internet service providers in our markets 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing internet services allows us to be competitive in providing those services 
data networks we generate data network services revenue from two primary sources leasing capacity on our facilities that utilize voice and data transmission circuits  dedicated to particular subscribers  which link a device in one location to another in a different location and through the sale of ip based data services on a secured shared network to businesses linking multiple enterprise locations 
the factor that has the greatest impact on year to year changes in data network services revenues is the number of data networks in use 
we compete against alascom  acs and other local telecommunication service providers 
managed services we design  sell  install  service and operate  on behalf of certain customers  communications and computer networking equipment and provide field depot  third party  technical support  communications consulting and outsourcing services 
we also supply integrated voice and data communications systems incorporating interstate and intrastate digital data networks  point to point and multipoint private network and small earth station services 
there are a number of competing companies in alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems 
our ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed us to maintain our market position based on value added support services rather than price competition 
these services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions  including managed services and outsourcing 
managed broadband services we generate managed broadband services revenue through our schoolaccess  connectmd and managed video conferencing products 
our customers may purchase end to end broadband services solutions blended with other transport and software products 
there are several competing companies in alaska that actively sell broadband services 
our ability to provide end to end broadband services solutions has allowed us to maintain our market position based on value added products and services rather than solely based on price competition

wireless services and products we generate wireless services and equipment revenues from four primary sources monthly plan fees  usage and roaming charges  wireless internet access  and handset and accessory sales 
we offer wireless services by selling services over our own facilities and reselling at t mobility s services under the gci brand name and by selling services over our own facilities under the alaska digitel and alaska wireless brand names 
we compete against at t mobility  acs  mta  and resellers of those services in anchorage and other markets 
the gci and alaska digitel brands compete against each other 
in december we signed an agreement with at t mobility that provides for an orderly transition of our wireless customers from the at t mobility network in alaska to our wireless facilities 
the agreement requires our customers to be on our wireless network by june   but allows our customers to use the at t mobility network for roaming during the transition period 
the four year transition period  which expires june   provides us adequate time to replace the at t mobility network in alaska with our own wireless facilities 
we started transitioning our customers to our wireless facilities in november on july   we completed the acquisition of all of the ownership interests in alaska wireless for an initial acquisition payment of million 
in addition to the initial acquisition payment  we have agreed to a contingent payment in if certain financial conditions are met 
alaska wireless is a gsm cellular provider and an internet service provider serving subscribers in the dutch harbor  sand point  and akutan  alaska areas 
in addition to the acquisition  we entered into a management agreement with the previous owners of alaska wireless 
the business continues to operate under the alaska wireless name and the previous owners continue to manage its day to day operations 
the results of operations generated by alaska wireless are included in wireless services in our consumer segment 
we acquired the remaining minority interest in alaska digitel for a total consideration of million effective august  we now own of alaska digitel 
prior to august   our control over the operations of alaska digitel was limited as required by the fcc upon their approval of our initial acquisition completed in january in conjunction with this acquisition we paid million to terminate the management agreement entered into upon our acquisition of of the equity interest of alaska digitel in january the termination cost is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense during the year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth selected statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated underlying data rounded to the nearest thousands percentage change percentage change year ended december  vs

a wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device 
year to date average monthly consumer wireless revenues divided by the average of consumer wireless subscribers at the beginning and ending of the period 
consumer segment revenues the increase in voice revenue is primarily due to a million or increase in the monthly local service network access fee and subscriber line charges as a result of increased local access lines partially offset by a  or decrease in recognized support from the usac primarily due to a change in our revenue accrual estimation to more precisely consider changes in fcc reimbursement and to consider uncertainties we believe may impact the amount of reimbursement we will receive 
the increase in video revenue is primarily due to the following a increase in programming services revenue to million in primarily resulting from an increase in basic and digital programming tier subscribers in  and a increase in equipment rental revenue to million in primarily resulting from our customers increased use of our hd dvr converter boxes 
the increase in data revenue is primarily due to a increase in cable modem revenue to million due to increased subscribers and their selection of more value added features 
the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of wireless subscribers and receipt of interstate common line support for prior periods 
due to the uncertainty in our ability to retroactively claim reimbursement under the program  we accounted for this payment as a gain contingency and  accordingly  recognized revenue only upon receipt of payment when realization was certain 
consumer segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to cost savings resulting from the increased deployment of local access services dlps lines on our own facilities during and decreased voice minutes carried 
the video cost of goods sold increase is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers  increased rates paid to programmers  increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered over our hd dvr converter boxes due to the increased number of boxes in service  and increased subscribers 
the data cost of goods sold increase is primarily due to increased internet circuit costs due to increased usage by customers and an increased number of cable modem subscribers 
the decrease in wireless cost of goods sold is primarily due to decreased costs due to the june  implementation of the new distribution agreement with at t mobility as described in part i item development of our business during the past fiscal year 
the decrease was partially off set by costs associated with the increased number of wireless subscribers described above 
consumer segment adjusted ebitda the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to increased margin resulting from increased subscribers for most product lines in and reduced wireless cost of goods sold as described in consumer segment cost of goods sold above 
the increased margin was partially offset by an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our consumer segment primarily due to an increase in the segment margin upon which the allocation is based

network access segment revenues the decrease in voice revenue is primarily due to the june  implementation of the new distribution agreement with at t mobility as described in part i item development of our business during the past fiscal year 
the voice revenue decrease also resulted from an decrease in our average rate per minute on billable minutes carried for our common carrier customers and the transition of voice traffic to dedicated networks 
the average rate per minute decrease is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic and a rate decrease mandated by federal law which will result in annual rate decreases of the increase in data revenue is primarily due to an increase in circuits sold and from other common carriers moving switched voice services to data networks 
the decrease in wireless revenue results primarily from a decrease in our rate per minute on billable minutes carried for customers roaming on our network 
network access segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to decreased long distance minutes carried 
partially offsetting this decrease is the absence of an  favorable adjustment based upon a refund for which negotiations were completed in in the course of business  we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
the decrease in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to the absence of  in costs to repair breaks in our undersea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems in that did not recur in network access segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda decrease was primarily due to decreased margin resulting from the decreased rate per minute on billable minutes carried for our common carrier customers

commercial segment revenues the decrease in voice revenue is primarily due to decreased long distance subscribers and decreased voice minutes carried partially off set by increased local access lines in service 
the increase in video revenue is primarily due to an increase in sales of cable advertising services due to the summer olympics programming and state and federal political advertising 
commercial segment data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on site customer support 
this latter category can vary significantly based on project activity 
the increase in data revenue is primarily due to a million or increase in managed services project revenue  and a million or increase in internet revenue primarily due to increased dedicated access service and enterprise data network service sales  and a non recurring  credit issued to a customer in june commercial segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold resulted primarily from an increase in local access lines in service on gci facilities 
the increase in data cost of goods sold resulted primarily from an increase in contract labor and internal labor classified as cost of goods sold due to the increase in managed services project revenue discussed above under commercial segment revenues 
commercial segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda increase was primarily due to increased margin resulting from increased dedicated access service and enterprise data network service sales  additional managed services projects and increased subscribers for most product lines in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii of this annual report on form k for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to consolidated income loss before income taxes

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in labor costs  million in additional expense resulting from our june   acquisition of uui and unicom  a million increase in our share based compensation expense  upon our acquisition of the remaining of alaska digitel we paid million to terminate the management agreement entered into in january  when we acquired of the outstanding shares of alaska digitel  a million increase in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual in  a million increase in our facilities lease expense  and million in additional expense incurred in for the conversion of our customers wireless phones to our facilities 
the selling  general and administrative expenses increase is partially off set by a million decrease in bad debt expense primarily due to improvements in our collections of consumer accounts receivable 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in  primarily due to the net increases described above without a proportional increase in revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in  and a million depreciation charge in to reflect a decrease in the estimated useful life of certain assets decommissioned in effective january   we prospectively changed our accounting policy for recording depreciation on our property and equipment placed in service 
for assets placed in service on or after january   we are using a mid month convention to recognize depreciation expense 
previous to this change  we used the half year convention to recognize depreciation expense in the year an asset was placed in service  regardless of the month the property and equipment was placed in service 
we believe the mid month convention is preferable because it results in more precise recognition of depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of the asset 
no retroactive adjustment has been made 
as a result of this accounting change  our reported amount of depreciation expense has decreased  our reported operating income has increased  and our reported net loss has decreased  our change in accounting policy would not have changed our reported basic or diluted eps in other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in interest expense to million in due to a million increase in interest expense on our senior credit facility to million resulting from additional debt from the additional incremental term loan agreement beginning in may and the increased interest rate on our senior credit facility beginning may million in additional interest expense resulting from the galaxy capital lease commencing in may  a loss of  relating to the fair value change on derivative instruments was reported in interest expense  and  of additional interest expense as a result of our acquisition of uui in june the increases described above are partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest from million in to million in income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in primarily due to the large amount of permanent differences in as compared to our net loss before income tax expense 
at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in through  and that expire in through  respectively 
tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december overview of revenues and cost of goods sold total revenues increased from million in to million in revenue increases in our consumer and managed broadband segments were partially off set by decreases in our network access and commercial segments

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents 
we believe  but can provide no assurances  that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
global capital and credit markets have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption 
despite this volatility and disruption  we continue to have full access to our senior credit facility 
although there can be no assurances in these difficult economic times that financial institutions will continue to provide financing  we believe that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be willing and able to provide financing to us in accordance with their legal obligations under our credit facilities 
while our short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise  the current decline in the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms  which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business 
we monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
our net cash flows provided by and used for operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for and  are summarized as follows operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities is due primarily to a million increase in long term deferred revenue due to cash received from iru capacity agreements 
investing activities the increase in cash flows used for investing activities is due primarily to cash expenditures of million for property and equipment  including construction in progress  the purchase of the stock of the uui and unicom subsidiaries of uci for million  net of cash received  the purchase of the remaining minority interest in alaska digitel for million  and the purchase of the stock of alaska wireless for million 
financing activities the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities is due primarily to borrowing of million in senior notes we have outstanding senior notes of million at december  we pay interest of on the senior notes and they are due in the senior notes are carried on our consolidated balance sheet net of the unamortized portion of the discount  which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes 
the senior notes are not redeemable prior to february  at any time on or after february   the senior notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days notice  at the following redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of redemption if redeemed during the twelve month period commencing february of the year indicated redemption price and thereafter the senior notes restrict gci  inc and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt  but permits debt under the senior credit facility and vendor financing as long as our leverage ratio does not exceed to one 
in addition  certain other debt is permitted regardless of our leverage ratio  including debt under the senior credit facility not exceeding and reduced by certain stated items million  reduced by the amount of any prepayments  or times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the last four full fiscal quarters of gci  inc and its subsidiaries 
the senior notes limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash dividend payments to gci 
semi annual interest payments of million are payable in february and august of each year 
the senior notes are structurally subordinate to our senior credit facility 
our senior notes key debt covenants require our total leverage ratio as defined be or less and our senior leverage ratio as defined be or less if our senior debt as defined is greater than million 
we were in compliance with all senior notes loan covenants at december senior credit facility the senior credit facility includes a million term loan  including the additional incremental term loan discussed below  and a million revolving credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
our term loan is fully drawn 
in may  we signed an agreement to add an additional incremental term loan of million to our then existing senior credit facility 
the additional incremental term loan will become due under the same terms and conditions as set forth in the existing senior credit facility 
the additional incremental term loan increased the interest rate on the term loan component of our senior credit facility from libor plus to libor plus 
the additional incremental term loan increased the revolving credit facility interest rate for our senior credit facility from libor plus a margin dependent upon our total leverage ratio ranging from to to libor plus the following applicable margin set forth opposite each applicable total leverage ratio below total leverage ratio as defined applicable margin but but the commitment fee we are required to pay on the unused portion of the commitment is 
substantially all of the company s assets collateralize the senior credit facility 
million was drawn on the additional incremental term loan at the time of the debt modification 
we used million of the proceeds to repay the revolver portion of our senior credit facility and our loan proceeds were reduced by million for an original issue discount and million for bank and legal fees associated with the new term loan 
we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility in october and we have letters of credit outstanding totaling million  which leaves million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility as of december  if needed 
the term loan allows for the repurchase of our common stock under our buyback program when our total debt leverage is below times adjusted ebitda 
the amendment revised various financial covenants in the agreement and made conforming changes to various covenants to permit our acquisitions 
additionally  our loan proceeds were reduced by million for an original issue discount 
the discount on the term loan is being amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on indebtedness  dividend payments  financial guarantees  business combinations  and other related items 
at december  we were in compliance with all loan covenants relating to our senior credit facility 
our senior credit facility  which was further amended in october to allow an additional million in capital expenditures for the year ended december   also limits the amount of capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions that we can incur each year 
if our capital expenditures for a given year are less than the maximum  the difference between the amount incurred and the maximum capital expenditure limitation may be carried over to the following year if certain levels of ebitda are met 
the transaction in may to add an additional incremental term loan of up to million to our existing senior credit facility was a partial substantial modification of our existing senior credit facility resulting in a  write off of previously deferred loan fees during the twelve months ended december  in our consolidated statement of operations 
deferred loan fees of  associated with the portion of our existing senior credit facility determined not to have been substantially modified continue to be amortized over the remaining life of the senior credit facility 
additionally  in connection with the additional incremental term loan  we paid bank fees and other expenses of million during  of which  were immediately expensed in and million were deferred and are being amortized over the remaining life of the senior credit facility 
in connection with the october amendment to the senior credit facility  we paid loan fees of  which are being amortized over the remaining life of the senior credit facility

our capital expenditures requirements in excess of approximately million per year are largely success driven and are a result of the progress we are making in the marketplace 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress to total million to million  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during planned capital expenditures over the next five years include those necessary for the expansion of alaska digitel s cdma network  construction of our gsm network  maintenance of existing facilities  growth of our long distance  local access  cable and internet facilities  improving network integrity  continuing deployment of dlps  adding new products  and introducing other new facilities and automation to reduce costs 
during alaska digitel and gci signed an agreement with a customer to build out alaska digitel s cdma network to provide expanded roaming area coverage 
if we fail to meet the schedule  the customer has the right to terminate the agreement and we may be required to pay up to million as liquidated damages

critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under gaap 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies for the year ended december  are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the likelihood that our customers will satisfactorily comply with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals  health clinics and school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  regulatory requirements  and our customers compliance with usac rules 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
impairment and useful lives of intangible assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets such as our cable certificates and wireless licenses are not amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment and quarterly evaluations of whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount as required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of the applicability of quoted market prices in active markets and  if quoted market prices are not available and or are not applicable  how the acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted cash flow analysis 
estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying asset or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized in our estimates 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles  we may consider other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations including third party assessments 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods and could result in write down of the value of intangible assets 
our cable certificates  wireless licenses and goodwill assets are our only indefinite lived intangible assets and because of the significance of these assets to our consolidated balance sheet  our annual and quarterly impairment analyses and quarterly evaluations of remaining useful lives are critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in market conditions or other externalities  or recognition of previously unrecognized intangible assets for impairment testing purposes could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
for the period from january  to december   the us financial markets have been impacted by continued deterioration in economic conditions 
should economic conditions in the state of alaska and other indicators deteriorate such that they impact our ability to achieve levels of forecasted operating results and cash flows  should our stock price and market capitalization decline below our book value for a sustained period of time  or should other events occur indicating the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets might be impaired  we would test our intangible assets for impairment and may recognize an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds such asset s fair value 
any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
accruals for unbilled costs we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
valuation allowance for net operating loss deferred tax assets our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in through  and that expire in through  respectively 
pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  share based expense  and financial instruments require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these and other matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  although outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic concentration and the alaska economy we offer voice  data and wireless telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  growth of our business and of our operations depends upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries  and in particular oil production  as well as investment earnings  tourism  government  and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us 
a significant part of the alaska economy is the state government 
all of the federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes  leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues for the state of alaska 
the state of alaska reported in fiscal that oil revenues  federal funding revenues  and investment revenues supplied  and  respectively  of the state s unrestricted revenues 
in fiscal state economists forecast that alaska s oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues will supply  and  respectively  of the state s total projected unrestricted revenues 
the volume of oil transported by the transalaska oil pipeline system over the past years has been as high as million barrels per day in fiscal production has been declining over the last several years with an average of million barrels produced per day in fiscal the state forecasts the production rate to decline from million barrels produced per day in fiscal to million barrels produced per day in fiscal market prices for north slope oil averaged in fiscal and are forecasted to average in fiscal the closing price per barrel was on february  to the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the state s projected prices  the state s projected revenues and deficits will change 
the production policy of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the state s revenue forecast 
the state of alaska maintains the constitutional budget reserve fund cbrf that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls 
if the state s current projections are realized and no surpluses are deposited into the cbrf it will be depleted in december the date the cbrf is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil 
if the fund is depleted  aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget 
the governor of the state of alaska and the alaska legislature continue to evaluate cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures 
should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed  the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the prudhoe bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the state  in general  and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services  and  therefore  on us  in particular 
periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr 
the united states energy information agency has estimated that it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of anwr exploration 
no assurance can be given that the driving forces in the alaska economy  and in particular  oil production  will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity 
no assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market 
we are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of north slope oil on alaska s economy or on us 
deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the state of alaska s north slope to the lower states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies 
there are two competing companies that are studying the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline  which depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas 
development of the ballistic missile defense system project has had a significant impact on alaskan telecommunication requirements 
the system is a fixed  land based  non nuclear missile defense system with a land and space based detection system capable of responding to limited strategic ballistic missile threats to the united states 
the system includes deployment of up to ground based interceptor silos and battle management command and control facilities at fort greely  alaska 
the united states army corps of engineers awarded a construction contract and construction of test bed facilities began in as of january a total of thirty ground based missile interceptors have been placed in underground silos 
tourism  air cargo  and service sectors have helped offset the prevailing pattern of oil industry downsizing that has occurred during much of the last several years 
we have  since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace  aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market 
the customer base in alaska is limited  however  with a population of approximately  people 
the state of alaska s population is distributed as follows are located in the municipality of anchorage  are located in the fairbanks north star borough  are located in the matanuska susitna borough  are located in the kenai peninsula borough  are located in the city and borough of juneau  and the remaining are located in other communities across the state of alaska 
seasonality revenue derived from our long distance services product in our network access segment have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
our long distance services product in our consumer and commercial segments and our other products in all our segments do not exhibit significant seasonality 
our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures  snow and short daylight hours 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
schedule of certain known contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years amounts in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease commitments purchase obligations total contractual obligations for long term debt included in the above table  we have included principal payments on our senior credit facility and senior notes 
interest on amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility is based on variable rates 
we used the current rate paid on the senior credit facility to estimate our future interest payments 
our senior notes require semi annual interest payments of million through february for a discussion of our senior notes and senior credit facility see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital lease obligations include our obligation to lease transponder capacity on galaxy for a discussion of our capital and operating leases  see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include a commitment to purchase hardware and software capable of providing wireless service to small markets in rural alaska of million 
the contract associated with this commitment is non cancelable 
purchase obligations also include open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling million which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets at december   because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at december  the open purchase orders are cancelable 
regulatory developments see part i item business regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
our senior credit facility carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus or less depending upon our total leverage ratio as defined 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
in july  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with a two year term to limit the libor rate on million of variable interest rate debt to 
the agreement is being accounted for as a derivative under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  each increase in the libor interest rate would result in million of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis
