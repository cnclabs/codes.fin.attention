item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in four reportable business segments of the hvacr industry 
our reportable segments include residential heating cooling  commercial heating cooling  service experts and refrigeration 
for more detailed information regarding our reportable segments  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our products and services are sold through a combination of distributors  independent and company owned dealer service centers  other installing contractors  wholesalers  manufacturers representatives  original equipment manufacturers and to national accounts 
the demand for our products and services is seasonal and dependent on the weather 
warmer than normal summer temperatures generate strong demand for replacement air conditioning and refrigeration products and services and colder than normal winter temperatures have the same effect on heating products and services 
conversely  cooler than normal summers and warmer than normal winters depress hvacr sales and services 
in addition to weather  demand for our products and services is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors  such as interest rates  the availability of financing  regional population and employment trends  new construction  general economic conditions and consumer spending habits and confidence 
the principal elements of cost of goods sold in our manufacturing operations are components  raw materials  factory overhead  labor and estimated costs of warranty expense 
in our service experts segment  the principal 
table of contents components of cost of goods sold are equipment  parts and supplies and labor 
the principal raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum 
in recent years  a trend towards higher prices for these commodities and related components continues to present a challenge to us and the hvacr industry in general 
we partially mitigate the impact of higher commodity prices through a combination of price increases  commodity contracts  improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 
we also partially mitigate volatility in the prices of these commodities by entering into futures contracts and fixed forward contracts 
we estimate approximately of the sales of our residential heating cooling segment is for new construction  with the balance attributable to repair  retrofit and replacement 
with the current downturn in residential and commercial new construction activity  we are seeing a decline in the demand for the products and services we sell into these markets 
our fiscal year ends on december and our interim fiscal quarters are each comprised of weeks 
for convenience  throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the week periods comprising each fiscal quarter are denoted by the last day of the calendar quarter 
impact of current economic environment on our business in  we faced unprecedented market challenges  particularly in the latter months of the year 
tight credit markets contributed to lower demand for housing that has resulted in far fewer starts in residential new construction and lower existing home sales 
in addition to residential heating cooling  the global economic downturn also negatively impacted our commercial heating cooling  refrigeration  and service experts businesses 
we continued to execute on our strategic priorities to win new business  capture opportunities in the replacement market  and lower our cost structure for the current market conditions 
the reduction in sales volumes has resulted in accelerated efforts in the areas of restructuring of operations throughout our business and implementing cost control measures 
these actions will reduce our operating costs  increase our ability to adjust to lower demand levels and changing market conditions while we continue to focus on providing our customers a high level of value and service 
we believe that when market conditions recover  we will be well positioned with significant upside leverage in our business model 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
manufacturing rationalization has been the focus of our efforts to date and includes the move of the production of value products to low cost locations  such as mexico and china 
new restructuring activities include the reorganization of our north american distribution network in order to reduce costs and improve service to our customers 
we continued our focus on controlling administrative costs and implemented measures to realign employee benefits and incentive compensation with current economic conditions 
commodity costs also have fluctuated substantially during  with significant increased costs for copper  aluminum and steel for much of the year and steep declines late in the year 
we utilized our commodity hedging program in order to mitigate the volatility in prices 
while we benefited from the cost averaging while commodity prices increased  the reverse is true when prices decline 
at year end we posted million of collateral for margin calls on our cash flow hedges 
the cash flow impact of this hedge collateral should reverse during as the related hedges expire 
during  we were able to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders through our share repurchase programs 
while we borrowed a portion of the funds used to execute these repurchases  overall low interest rates make the repurchase attractive 
the repurchase also lowers our overall cost of capital 
as of december   we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
additionally  lower interest rates in the commercial paper market allowed us to utilize our asset securitization facility and we sold million of our accounts receivable late in the year 
our cash generation continues to be strong as we were able to adjust to the current market conditions with an emphasis on working capital management through our accounts receivable collections and inventory controls 
although our overall exposure to declines in security market values is somewhat limited  the rapid declines in the overall equity markets had a direct impact on our pension obligation 
the market values of our pension plan assets declined substantially as a result of the market decline 
as a result of the decrease in the plan assets and an increase in the benefit obligation  the funded status of our pension plans decreased by million 
in order to mitigate the effects of asset losses  we made an additional voluntary contribution of million to our pension 
table of contents plans during the fourth quarter of and we currently plan to make additional voluntary contributions of million to million throughout key financial statistics net sales for the year ended december  were  million and were adversely impacted on a year over year basis primarily by lower volumes in the us residential new construction market 
price increases and foreign currency translation rates had a favorable impact on net sales in and therefore partially offset the decline in sales volumes 
operational income for the year ended december  was million 
as a percentage of net sales  operational income decreased to in from in the decline in operational income margins was primarily due to lower sales volumes and increased commodity and other manufacturing costs which were partially offset by price increases 
net income for was million 
basic earnings per share from continuing operations was in as compared to in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was per share in  down from per share in both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were favorably impacted by approximately per share due to the effect of our previous share repurchases 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in cash provided by operating activities was lower primarily due to lower net income  collateral posted related to commodity hedges and voluntary pension contributions 
these were partially offset by increased collections of accounts receivable and cash inflows from our asset securitization program 
in  lennox returned to shareholders million through share repurchases and million through cash dividends

table of contents the following table sets forth net sales by geographic market dollars in millions for the years ended december  dollars percent dollars percent dollars percent geographic market us canada international total net sales year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated results net sales net sales decreased million  or  for as compared to the decrease in net sales was due to a decrease in sales volumes across all segments  but was primarily caused by lower volumes related to us residential and commercial new construction 
our residential heating cooling and service experts segments experienced decreases in sales due primarily to the weakened us residential new construction market 
our commercial heating cooling segment experienced a smaller decrease in unit volumes than our residential heating cooling segment as the decline in the commercial market trailed the residential new construction market 
declines in unit volumes were also partially offset by moderate price increases  a slight favorable change in sales mix and million of favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
gross profit gross profit margin remained relatively flat at for compared to for gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the decreased sales volumes and increased commodity costs experienced for much of also  gross margins contained a one time favorable warranty program adjustment of million 
sales mix partially offset these negative impacts as residential heating cooling customers purchased a higher percentage of our premium product offerings 
we also were successful in increasing the price of our products to incorporate increases in costs related to commodities and fuel 
the changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our gross margins 
also favorably impacting gross margins was a million reduction in salaries and wages expense related to a change in our vacation policy 
while we realized savings from previously announced and implemented restructurings and cost reduction programs  the full effect on gross margins was mitigated by manufacturing inefficiencies that were incurred related to those activities 
these inefficiencies were related to the move of certain manufacturing operations to saltillo  mexico and other manufacturing rationalization activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses for the year decreased by million in compared to as a percentage of total net sales  sg a expenses were for both and the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to cost control measures and the operation of incentive compensation plans that lowered short term incentives  including profit sharing  due to certain performance targets not being met in  whereas in virtually all targets were met or exceeded 
decreased long term incentive stock based compensation primarily due to reduced projected future payout percentages and increased forfeiture rates 
reduced professional fees due to limits on third party spending for services 
lowered commission expense due to lower sales volumes 
decreased pension expense due to lower settlement charges in as compared to 
table of contents decreased salaries and wages expense due to a change in our vacation policy whereby vacation no longer vests or accrues for the current year as of december of the previous year 
employees now earn vacation throughout the year the vacation is taken 
the change in policy reduced sg a expenses by million 
decreased salaries and wages expense due to a reduction in salaried headcount 
these decreases in sg a expenses were partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense as a result of increased economic pressure on our customers  the impact of foreign currency exchange rates as the dollar weakened against currencies in some of the foreign countries where we operate  and increased research and development spending 
gains and other expenses  net gains and other expenses  net for and included the following in millions for the years ended december  realized losses gains on settled futures contracts unrealized losses on unsettled futures contracts not designated as cash flow hedges gains on disposals of fixed assets foreign currency exchange gains other items  net gains and other expenses  net the changes in gains and losses on futures contracts were primarily due to decreases in commodity prices relative to the futures contract prices during as compared to for more information  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
gains on disposals of fixed assets included gains recorded on the sale leaseback of two properties located in north america 
restructuring charges as part of our strategic priorities of manufacturing and sourcing excellence  distribution excellence and expense reduction  we have initiated actions designed to improve the delivery of our products to customers and also to lower our cost structure 
we have initiated new manufacturing rationalization actions in and also have begun to reorganize our north american distribution network in order to better serve our customers needs by deploying parts and equipment inventory closer to them 
we have also initiated a number of activities that rationalize and reorganize various support and administrative functions in order to reduce ongoing selling and administrative expenses 
we have increased our focus on restructuring activities as we adjust our cost structure in response to economic conditions 
in and  we incurred restructuring charges consisting of for the years ended december  manufacturing rationalizations reorganization of distribution network reorganizations of corporate and business unit administrative functions other total 
table of contents for further detail regarding restructuring reserves and individual restructuring actions  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing rationalizations the restructuring charges incurred in related to manufacturing rationalizations included million of severance and related charges  million of asset write offs and accelerated depreciation  million of equipment move charges and million of other costs 
these other costs were primarily manufacturing inefficiencies caused by decreased volumes at affected facilities and inventory move costs 
restructuring charges incurred related to manufacturing rationalizations during related primarily to the closures of the danville  lynwood  and bellevue  ohio operations 
to date and in total  we have incurred million of restructuring charges related to manufacturing rationalizations for projects that were in process during of that amount  million was severance costs  million was asset write offs and accelerated depreciation  million of equipment move charges  million of pension curtailments  other personnel related charges of million  and other charges  including manufacturing inefficiencies and inventory move costs of million 
in the future  we expect to incur additional charges of million related to the projects that were in process during of the additional charges expected  million is accelerated depreciation and  therefore  a non cash charge 
on february  we also announced plans to consolidate operations from our blackville  south carolina facility into our current operations in orangeburg  south carolina and saltillo  mexico to improve our operating efficiency  eliminate redundant fixed costs and provide customers with improved service 
the transition is expected to take place in phases and is expected to be completed within two years 
we expect to incur restructuring charges of about million related to this consolidation  primarily in the first quarter of these charges are anticipated to include severance of million  losses on disposal of certain long lived assets and relocation costs for equipment and inventory of about million and other costs of million 
we expect short term cash outlays of million related to this project 
annual savings beginning in are expected to be approximately million 
reorganization of north american distribution network in the fourth quarter of  we commenced the transition of activities currently performed at our north american parts center in des moines  iowa to other locations  including our north american distribution center in marshalltown  iowa 
the transition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of to date and in total  we have incurred million of restructuring charges related to the reorganization of our north american distribution network 
of that amount million was severance costs and million was a pension curtailment 
in the future  we expect to incur additional charges of million related to this project consisting of million in severance  million in relocation costs  million in equipment move costs  and million of other costs 
of the additional charges expected  million is accelerated depreciation and  therefore  a non cash charge 
we anticipate that we will initiate additional restructuring activities in this area as we seek to further enhance our north american distribution network 
reorganizations of support and administrative functions the restructuring charges incurred in related to the reorganization of support and administrative functions included million of severance and related charges  million of asset write offs and accelerated depreciation  million of lease termination costs and million of other costs 
restructuring charges in primarily related to the elimination of the position of chief administrative officer 
in connection with this action  we recorded an million liability to settle the terms of his employment agreement  of which million  net of million of previously recorded stock based compensation expense  was recorded in the second quarter of the final settlement of this matter occurred and an amount equal to the liability recorded was paid during the second quarter of to date and in total  we have incurred million of restructuring charges related to reorganizations of support and administrative functions for projects that were in process during of that amount  million 
table of contents was severance costs  million was asset write offs and accelerated depreciation  million lease termination costs  and the remainder of million was other charges 
in the future  we expect to incur additional charges of million related to these projects 
of the additional charges expected  million is accelerated depreciation and  therefore  a non cash charge 
cash used in restructuring activities  future charges and expense savings total cash paid for restructuring activities during was million  a significant increase over the amount of million 
a significant portion of this amount related to increased restructuring activities and was primarily composed of severance payments related to the elimination of the position of chief administrative officer and severance related to manufacturing rationalizations and administrative reorganizations 
we use operating cash as the funding source for restructuring activities 
we anticipate incurring approximately million of future restructuring charges relating to projects that were in process during of that amount  about million will be non cash charges for accelerated depreciation and impairments 
future cash outlays for restructuring activities that are currently in progress are estimated to be million 
these restructuring charges and cash outlays will be incurred generally within the next year 
in we realized approximately million of incremental expense savings from our restructuring activities and we expect to realize an additional million of expense savings in results from equity method and other equity investments investments where we do not exercise control but have significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
income from equity method investments decreased to million in when compared to million in primarily due to the lowered performance of our us joint venture in compressor manufacturing due to a reduction in our volume of purchases from such joint venture 
in  we also recorded million of impairment charges related to our investment in a joint venture in thailand 
the carrying value of this investment at year end was million and  due to a loss of significant influence over the venture  it will no longer be accounted for under the equity method 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher debt balances as the result of increased borrowing related to our share repurchases during the first two quarters of of million 
offsetting the increase in the average amounts borrowed was a decrease in the average interest rate paid on variable rate debt 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in the effective tax rate was for as compared to for our effective rates differ from the statutory federal rate of for certain items  such as state and local taxes  non deductible expenses  foreign operating losses for which no tax benefits have been recognized and foreign taxes at rates other than 
our effective rate was also impacted in by a non deductible impairment charge and foreign operating losses for which no tax benefits have been recognized 
these two items combined add approximately percentage points to our effective tax rate 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  results by segment residential heating cooling the following table summarizes our residential heating cooling segment s net sales and profit for and dollars in millions years ended december  difference change net sales profit of net sales the decrease in net sales was due to continuing weakness in the us residential new construction market and softer replacement business as consumers remain cautious in the current economic environment 
we believe that unit volumes were generally lower across the residential hvac industry 
an additional impact on volume for our value product offerings is that a higher number of consumers in difficult market conditions are electing to repair versus replace their hvac equipment 
as a result  unit volumes were down in as compared to the decrease related to sales volumes was partially offset by favorable product mix shift towards our premium products and price increases 
we believe that customers with disposable income are moving towards higher efficiency premium systems 
segment profit decreased primarily due to the unfavorable impact of lower unit volumes  increased commodity costs and higher freight costs 
these unfavorable impacts to segment profit were partially offset by favorable product mix  price increases and lower expenses due to lower sales volumes and also from cost controls and programs that resulted in lower personnel related and incentive compensation expenses 
in  a favorable warranty program adjustment of million was not included in our residential heating cooling segment s profit as it is considered an unusual and nonrecurring item 
while the residential heating cooling segment realized savings from previously announced and implemented restructurings and cost reduction programs  the full effect on gross margins was mitigated by some manufacturing inefficiencies related to those activities 
commercial heating cooling the following table summarizes our commercial heating cooling segment s net sales and profit for and dollars in millions years ended december  difference change net sales profit of net sales our domestic operations experienced lower sales volumes on a year over year basis primarily due to the softening in our retail national account business as customers extended times between scheduled unit replacements and deferred new store openings 
these reductions were partially offset by price increases 
sales mix was slightly unfavorable 
sales mix was positive for the first three quarters due to the relatively high levels of newly introduced premium product during the early part of the year 
the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by million 
the reduced segment profit was due primarily to lower sales volumes  increased commodity costs  and higher freight and distribution costs 
sales mix remained relatively flat for the year 
the decreases noted above were partially offset by price increases and reduced manufacturing costs primarily in our domestic operations  lower

service experts the following table summarizes our service experts segment s net sales and profit from continuing operations for and dollars in millions years ended december  difference change net sales profit of net sales the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the decline in the residential new construction and residential service and replacement markets resulting from the weakness of the us economy 
this was primarily due to volume as both price and sales mix were relatively flat 
the decrease in segment profit was primarily due to the decrease in sales volume  unfavorable sales mix within the residential service and replacement market  and higher year over year customer contact center implementation costs 
sales mix adversely impacted segment profit due to a decrease in replacement sales as customers decided to repair units instead of replace them 
these factors were offset by lower commissions due to lower sales volumes  lower advertising expenditures and cost controls and programs that resulted in lower personnel related and incentive compensation expenses 
near the end of  we announced plans to exit seven unprofitable service centers 
as a result  we have reclassified losses incurred related to these service centers in of million to discontinued operations 
this compares with losses incurred in of million 
we anticipate that theses centers will be disposed of in a relatively short period 
also  included in discontinued operations was a million charge for litigation related to the sale of a service center in that was included in discontinued operations 
these amounts have been excluded from service experts operating profit in both periods presented 
refrigeration the following table summarizes our refrigeration segment s net sales and profit for and dollars in millions years ended december  difference change net sales profit of net sales net sales increased due to the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of million and moderate price increases implemented primarily in our domestic and australian operations as a result of higher commodity and component costs 
these favorable items were partially offset by moderate decreases in unit volumes in all of the geographic areas where the refrigeration segment operates 
the decrease in segment profit was primarily due to lower sales volumes  increased commodity costs and manufacturing inefficiencies that resulted primarily from manufacturing rationalization activities at affected locations 
these unfavorable impacts to segment profit were partially offset by the price increases noted above  favorable foreign currency exchange rates  and lower administrative expenses due to cost controls and programs that resulted in lower personnel related and incentive compensation expenses 

table of contents while the refrigeration segment realized savings from previously announced and implemented restructurings and cost reduction programs  the full effect on our gross margins was not apparent due to manufacturing inefficiencies that were incurred related to those activities 
corporate and other corporate and other expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in both short term and long term incentive compensation due to decreased financial performance  expense reduction in professional fees related to compliance activities  changes in employee benefits  foreign currency gains and overall tight budgetary controls 
the decrease in long term stock based compensation expense was primarily due to an increase in forfeiture rates and a decrease in the estimated pay out percentage on outstanding performance share units in as compared to a portion of the decrease in corporate and other expenses was composed of the favorable catch up adjustment related to foreign currency in the second quarter and a reduction in salaries and wages expense caused by a change to our vacation policy 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated results net sales the favorable impact of foreign currency translation increased net sales by million 
additionally  net sales were higher due to increased prices in response to an increase in commodity costs across our segments in volumes increased in three of our four business segments  largely the result of favorable international markets 
we had favorable product mix in both our commercial heating cooling and residential heating cooling segments 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in volumes in our residential heating cooling segment  primarily due to the downturn in the us residential new construction market 
gross profit gross profits increased across all business segments  largely due to favorable changes in our product mix and through a favorable combination of price increases  commodity contracts  improved production efficiency and cost reduction initiatives 
gross profit for contains a million benefit from a one time adjustment to a warranty program in our residential heating cooling segment

commercial heating cooling the following table summarizes our commercial heating cooling segment s net sales and profit for and dollars in millions years ended december  difference change net sales profit of net sales the increase in net sales was due primarily to price increases throughout the segment combined with a favorable product mix in our domestic operations and an increase in sales volumes in europe 
an increase in demand for higher efficiency units and customized products  as well as a favorable mix in the new construction markets  drove the change in domestic product mix 
volume growth in our european operations primarily related to emerging markets in eastern europe 
the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by million 
a favorable mix of higher margin products in our domestic operations is the primary reason for the increase in segment profit 
additionally  an increase in volume in our european operations contributed to the increase in segment profit 
price increases effectively offset increases in commodity and component costs 
service experts the following table summarizes our service experts segment s net sales and profit from continuing operations for and dollars in millions years ended december  difference change net sales profit of net sales 
table of contents the increase in net sales was driven by favorable residential service and replacement sales  which provided over half of the total segment sales in and residential service and replacement sales increased year over year  more than offsetting a decline in residential and commercial new construction sales and commercial service and replacement sales 
favorable market conditions increased residential new construction sales in our canadian operations  partially offsetting a decrease in us residential new construction sales 
the favorable impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates increased net sales by million

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through internally generated funds  bank lines of credit and a revolving period asset securitization arrangement 
working capital needs are generally greater in the first and second quarters due to the seasonal nature of our business cycle 
as of december   our debt to total capital ratio was  up from as of december   primarily due to increased debt to partially fund our repurchase of million of our common stock in under our share repurchase plans 
these share repurchases also reduced stockholders equity by that same amount and therefore increased financial leverage 
our stockholders equity also decreased during due to changes in aoci 
we incurred comprehensive losses related to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of million as the us dollar strengthened against the currencies in the areas of the world where we operate

if any event of default occurs and is continuing  lenders with a majority of the aggregate commitments may require the administrative agent to terminate our right to borrow under the credit agreement and accelerate amounts due under the credit agreement  except for a bankruptcy event of default  in which case such amounts will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate 
in addition to the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement outlined above  our domestic promissory notes also contain certain financial covenant restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenant requirements 
our obligations under the facility and promissory notes are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries

under a revolving period asset securitization arrangement asa  we are eligible to transfer beneficial interests in a portion of our trade accounts receivable to third parties in exchange for cash 
our continued involvement in the transferred assets is limited to servicing 
these transfers are accounted for as sales rather than secured borrowings 
the fair values assigned to the retained and transferred interests are based primarily on the receivables carrying value given the short term to maturity and low credit risk 
the asa provides for a maximum securitization amount of million or of the net pool balance as defined by the asa 
however  eligibility for securitization is limited based on the quality of the accounts receivable and is calculated monthly 
the beneficial interest sold cannot exceed the maximum amount even if our qualifying accounts receivable is greater than the maximum amount at any point in time 
the eligible amounts available were as follows in millions for the years ended december  eligible amount available under the asa on qualified accounts receivable beneficial interest sold remaining amount available as of december   million of cash and cash equivalents were restricted primarily due to routine lockbox collections and letters of credit issued with respect to the operations of our captive insurance subsidiary  which expire on december   and will be renewed upon expiration 
these letters of credit restrictions can be transferred to our revolving lines of credit as needed 
on july   we announced that our board of directors approved the share repurchase plan  pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to million of shares of our common stock through open market purchases

we periodically review our capital structure  including our primary bank facility  to ensure that it has adequate liquidity 
we believe that cash flows from operations  as well as available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other existing sources of funding  will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future and the share repurchases during the term of the share repurchase plan 
during the third quarter of  we amended the lease agreement for our corporate headquarters 
while the same party continues to be the lessor under the lease  the amendment  among other things  replaced the debt participant and moderately increased the rent payments 
the amendment also provides for consistency of financial covenants with our revolving credit agreement and we are in compliance with these financial covenants 
the lease will continue to be accounted for as an operating lease

due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of payments associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
purchase obligations consist of aluminum commitments 
the above table does not include retirement  postretirement and warranty liabilities because it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
on december   we made a voluntary contribution of million and as a result there are no minimum required contributions for our us qualified pension plans in however  we currently plan to make additional voluntary contributions of million to million for our global plans throughout we also estimate that our contribution to the postretirement benefit plan will be approximately million

as of december   we estimate that we will incur an additional million above the contractual obligations on these leases until the fair value of the leased vehicles fully mitigates our residual value guarantee obligation under the lease agreements 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which establishes a framework for measuring fair value clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework  and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  in february  the financial 
table of contents accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp no 
 which deferred the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for non financial assets and liabilities  except for certain items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements for items within the scope of fsp no 
 which became effective on january  fair value hierarchy the three level fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements defined by sfas no 
is as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets at the measurement date and for the anticipated term of the instrument 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
fair value techniques our valuation techniques are applied to all of the assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of january   upon adoption of sfas no 
where available  the fair values are based upon quoted prices in active markets 
however  if quoted prices are not available  then the fair values are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or independently sourced market parameters  such as credit default swap spreads  yield curves  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  interest rates and benchmark securities 
for assets and liabilities with a lack of observable market activity  if any  the fair values are based upon discounted cash flow methodologies incorporating assumptions that  in our judgment  reflect the assumptions a marketplace participant would use 
to ensure that financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value  valuation adjustments may be required to reflect either party s creditworthiness and ability to pay 
where appropriate  these amounts were incorporated into our valuations as of december   the measurement date 
our adoption of sfas no 
has resulted in changes to the valuation techniques used when determining the fair value of our derivative instruments 
these derivatives are primarily valued using estimated future cash flows that are based directly on observed prices from exchange traded derivatives and  therefore  have been classified as level we also take into account the counterparty s creditworthiness  or our own creditworthiness  as appropriate 
an adjustment has been recorded in order to reflect the risk of credit default  but these adjustments have been insignificant to the overall value of the derivatives 
the effect of adopting these changes to the valuation techniques was not material 
the majority of our short term investments are managed by professional investment advisors 
the net asset values are furnished in statements received from the investment advisor and reflect valuations based upon the respective pricing policies utilized by the investment advisor 
we have assessed the classification of the inputs used to value these investments as level through examination of pricing policies and significant inputs and through discussions with investment managers 
the fair values of our short term investments are based on several observable inputs including  but not limited to  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads and benchmark securities 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in no net changes to the valuations for these securities 
market risk our results of operations can be affected by changes in exchange rates 
net sales and expenses in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes based on the average exchange rate for the 
table of contents period 
during  and  net sales from outside the us represented  and  respectively  of our total net sales 
historically  foreign currency transaction gains losses have not had a material effect on our overall operations 
as of december   the impact to net income of a change in exchange rates is estimated to be approximately million 
we enter into commodity futures contracts to stabilize prices expected to be paid for raw materials and parts containing high copper and aluminum content 
these contracts are for quantities equal to or less than quantities expected to be consumed in future production 
as of december   we had metal futures contracts maturing at various dates through may with a fair value liability of million 
the impact of a change in commodity prices would not have a significant impact on our results from operations on an annual basis  absent any other contravening actions 
our results of operations can be affected by changes in interest rates due to variable rates of interest on our revolving credit facilities 
a basis point change in interest rates would impact our results of operations by approximately million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgments and estimates 
the critical accounting policies are described below to provide a better understanding of how we develop our judgments about future events and related estimations and how such policies can impact our financial statements 
a critical accounting policy is one that requires difficult  subjective or complex estimates and assessments and is fundamental to the results of operations 
we consider our most critical accounting policies to be allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and other intangible assets  product warranties  pension and postretirement benefits  stock based compensation  self insurance expense 
derivative accounting  and income taxes
