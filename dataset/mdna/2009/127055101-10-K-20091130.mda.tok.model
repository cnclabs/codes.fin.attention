item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if i the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and ii different estimates and assumptions were used  the result could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates that we believe are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are presented below 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
if we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment  the revenue is deferred until product acceptance has occurred 
shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
the following table summarizes the percentages of total net sales and other operating revenues recognized in each of our reportable segments 
other operating revenues  which represent less than two percent of total revenues  are primarily royalties for licensed technology years ended september core segment rubber blacks business supermetals business performance segment new business segment specialty fluids segment as indicated above  we derive a substantial majority of revenues from the sale of products in our core and performance segments 
revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
we offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives 
the discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations 
we periodically review the assumptions underlying the estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly 
certain rubber blacks business and performance segment customer contracts contain price protection clauses that provide for the potential reduction in past or future sales prices under specific circumstances 
we analyze these contract provisions to determine if an obligation related to these clauses exists and record revenue net of any estimated protection commitments 
the majority of the revenue in the specialty fluids segment arises from the rental of cesium formate 
this revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms 
customers are also billed and revenue is recognized  typically at the end of the job  for cesium formate product that is not returned 

table of contents we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable and other economic information on both an historical and prospective basis 
customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
changes in the allowance during fiscal and were not material 
there is no off balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances 
inventory valuation the cost of most raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories in the us is determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
total us inventories utilizing this cost flow assumption were million and million at september  and  respectively 
these inventories represent and of total worldwide inventories at the respective year ends 
had we used the first in  first out fifo method instead of the lifo method for such inventories  the value of those inventories would have been million and million higher as of september  and september   respectively 
the cost of other us and all non us inventories is determined using the average cost method or the fifo method 
in periods of rapidly rising or declining raw material costs  the inventory method we employ can have a significant impact on our profitability 
under our current lifo method  when raw material costs are rising  our most recent higher priced purchases are the first to be charged to cost of sales 
if  however  we were using a fifo method  our purchases from days earlier  which were at lower prices  would instead be the first charged to cost of sales 
the opposite result could occur during a period of rapid decline in raw material costs 
at certain times  we may decrease inventory levels to the point where layers of inventory recorded under the lifo method that were purchased in preceding years are liquidated 
the inventory in these layers may be valued at an amount that is different than our current costs 
if there is a liquidation of an inventory layer  there may be an impact to our cost of sales and net income for that period 
if the liquidated inventory is at a cost lower than our current cost  there would be a reduction in our cost of sales and an increase to our net income during the period 
conversely  if the liquidated inventory is at a cost higher than our current cost  there will be an increase in our cost of sales and a reduction to our net income during the period 
during fiscal  and  inventory quantities were reduced at our us supermetals site 
additionally  during fiscal and inventory quantities were reduced at our us rubber blacks and performance products sites  leading to liquidations of lifo inventory quantities 
these lifo layer liquidations resulted in a decrease of cost of goods sold of million  million and million and an increase in net income of million per diluted common share  million per diluted common share and million per diluted common share for fiscal  and  respectively 
we review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential loss of value periodically 
in this review  we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete  unmarketable or slow moving inventory 
we write down our inventories if they are considered to be obsolete or unsaleable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in cases where inventories are still saleable but the market value is below cost  the inventory is adjusted to its market value 
historically  such write downs have not been significant 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment  however  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings 
stock based compensation we issue restricted stock and stock options under our equity compensation plans 
the fair value of restricted stock is based on intrinsic value at the grant date and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
there are no significant estimates involved in 
table of contents recording compensation costs under the intrinsic value method with the exception of estimates we make around the probability of forfeitures 
changes in the forfeiture assumptions could impact our earnings but would not impact our cash flows 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options issued under our equity compensation plans 
in determining the fair value of stock options  we make a variety of assumptions and estimates  including discount rates  forfeiture rates  volatility measures  expected dividends and expected option lives 
changes to such assumptions and estimates can result in different fair values and could therefore impact our earnings 
such changes would not impact our cash flows 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an impairment test for goodwill at least annually and when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
to test whether an impairment exists  the fair value of the applicable reporting unit is estimated based on discounted future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value is sensitive to both the estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows 
the assumptions used to estimate the discounted cash flows are based on management s best estimates about selling prices  production and sales volumes  costs  future growth rates  capital expenditures and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital that is determined by evaluating the risk free rate of return  cost of debt and expected equity premiums 
if an impairment exists  a loss to write down the value of goodwill to its implied fair value is recorded 
while this would have no direct impact on our cash flows  it would reduce our earnings 
no impairments were recorded in fiscal  or valuation of long lived assets our long lived assets primarily include property  plant  equipment  long term investments and assets held for rent 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the way the asset is being used  a decline in the physical condition of the asset or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
we make various estimates and assumptions when analyzing whether there is an impairment of our long lived assets  excluding goodwill and long term investments 
these estimates and assumptions include determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the useful life of the asset over which the cash flows will occur  their amounts and the asset s residual value  if any 
an asset impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the undiscounted estimated cash flows expected from the asset 
the impairment loss is determined by the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
our estimated future cash flows reflect management s assumptions about selling prices  production and sales volume  costs  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset 
while an impairment charge would have no direct impact on our cash flows  it would reduce our earnings 
the fair values of long term investments are dependent on the financial performance of the entities in which we invest and the external factors inherent in the markets in which these entities operate 
we consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of the investment entities when assessing the potential impairment of these investments 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments 
the carrying values of our financial instruments approximate fair value with the exception of certain long term debt that has not been designated with a fair value hedge 
this 
table of contents portion of long term debt is recorded at face value 
the fair values of our derivative instruments are based on quoted market prices 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which exist as part of our on going business operations 
we do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes  nor do we hold or issue any financial instruments for trading purposes 
all derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
the changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in either earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether or not the instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if designated as part of a hedge transaction  the type of hedge transaction 
the gains or losses on derivative instruments reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are affected by the underlying hedged item 
the ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in earnings immediately 
in accordance with our risk management strategy  we may enter into certain derivative instruments that may not be designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes 
although these derivatives are not designated as hedges  we believe that such instruments are closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
we record directly to earnings the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges 
in the recent past  the ability of financial counterparties to perform under these financial instruments has become less certain 
we attempt to take into account the financial viability of counterparties in both valuing the instruments and determining their effectiveness as hedging instruments 
if a counterparty was unable to perform  our ability to qualify for hedge accounting for certain transactions would be compromised and the realizable value of these financial instruments would be uncertain 
as a result  our results of operations and cash flows could be impacted 
we carry a variety of different cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets 
we continually assess the liquidity of cash and cash equivalents and as of september   we have determined that they are readily convertible to cash 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees 
in addition  we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
the assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans  are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans where applicable and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees 
the most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets 
assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied  they include estimated discount rates  rates of compensation increases for employees  mortality  employee turnover and other related demographic data 
projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends 
we compute our recorded obligations globally in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
under such principles  if actual results differ from what is projected  the differences are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
however  cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  restructuring activities resulted in certain pension plan curtailments and settlements  which tend to accelerate the recognition of the deferred gains and losses 
self insurance reserves we are partially self insured for certain third party liability  workers compensation and employee medical benefits in the united states 
the third party and workers compensation liabilities are managed 
table of contents through a wholly owned insurance captive and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
the employee medical obligations are managed by a third party provider and the related liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements 
to limit our potential liabilities for these risks  however  we purchase insurance from third parties that provides individual and aggregate stop loss protection 
the aggregate self insured liability for combined workers compensation and third party liabilities in the united states in fiscal is million  and the retention for medical costs in the united states is at most  per person per annum 
we have accrued amounts equal to the actuarially determined future liabilities 
we determine the actuarial assumptions in collaboration with third party actuaries  based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for such matters as legal actions  medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and impact our earnings and cash flows 
asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations by estimating incremental costs for special handling  removal and disposal costs of materials that may or will give rise to conditional asset retirement obligations aros and then discount the expected costs back to the current year using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
aro liabilities and costs are recognized when the timing and or settlement can be reasonably estimated 
if it is unclear when  or if  an aro will be triggered  we use probability weightings for possible timing scenarios to determine the amounts that should be recognized in our financial statements 
the estimation of aros is subject to a number of inherent uncertainties including a the timing of when any aro may be incurred  b the ability to accurately identify and reasonably estimate the costs of all materials that may require special handling or treatment  c the ability to assess the relative probability of different scenarios that could give rise to an aro  and d other factors outside our control  including changes in regulations  costs and interest rates 
aros have not been recognized for certain of our facilities because either the present value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminable facility life or we do not have a legal obligation associated with the retirement of those facilities 
in most circumstances where aros have been recorded  the anticipated cash outflows will likely take place far into the future 
accordingly  actual costs and the timing of such costs may vary significantly from our estimates  which may  in turn  impact our earnings 
in general  however  when such estimates change  the impact is spread over future years and thus the impact on any individual year is unlikely to be material 
litigation and contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including personal injury and environmental litigation 
after consultation with counsel  as appropriate  we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range 
our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information  including claims  settlement offers  demands by government agencies  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute  and our prior experience 
litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows 
the most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims 
the amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites  the nature of the remedies  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
a portion of the reserve for environmental matters 
table of contents is recognized on a discounted basis  which requires the use of estimated discount rates and estimates of future cash flows associated with the liability 
these liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information  changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations  which could result in higher or lower costs 
our current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time 
developments that could affect our estimate include  but are not limited to  i significant changes in the number of future claims  ii changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending silica and non malignant asbestos claims  iii significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims  iv significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims  v changes in the nature of claims received  vi changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims  vii the financial viability of other parties that contribute to the settlement of respirator claims  viii a change in the availability of american optical s insurance coverage  ix changes in the allocation of costs among other parties that contribute to the settlement of respirator claims and x a determination that our interpretation of the contractual obligations on which we have estimated our share of liability is inaccurate 
we cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims 
accordingly  the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount 
further  if the timing of our actual payments made for respirator claims differs significantly from our estimated payment schedule  and we could no longer reasonably predict the timing of such payments  we could then be required to record the reserve amount on an undiscounted basis on our consolidated balance sheets  causing an immediate impact to earnings 
income taxes our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries 
we file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction s tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
we have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
certain of these reserves are for uncertain income tax positions taken on income tax returns 
we record obligations for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities 
if this threshold is not met  the full amount of the uncertain tax position is recorded as a liability 
if the threshold is met  the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this analysis presumes the taxing authorities full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts  but does not consider the time value of money 
we also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carry forwards  foreign tax credits  and other income tax credits 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time 
we review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis 
failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the 
table of contents recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets 
an increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense and lower stockholders equity  and could have a significant impact on our earnings in future periods 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
highly inflationary environments we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment 
if and when a currency is determined to be highly inflationary cumulative inflation of approximately percent or more over a year period  the functional currency of the affected operation would be changed to our reporting currency  the us dollar 
this change in functional currency to the us dollar would result in i a one time remeasurement of our net monetary assets and liabilities  directly impacting our statement of operations  and ii foreign exchange gains or losses being recognized on all transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of september   venezuela is on our watch list and we expect the bolivar will trigger highly inflationary accounting during fiscal restructuring activities our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the restructuring accruals 
our restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of numerous factors  including i severance benefits to be granted to employees which are based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  ii the timeframe and costs to vacate certain facilities and iii asset impairments 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
these deviations may lead to changes in estimates  which would then be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies we have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in note a of the notes to our consolidated financial statements and in item below 
certain of these policies include the use of estimates  but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure 
however  these policies are important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
newly issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations that will become effective for all business combinations completed by us on or after october  the guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
it also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that changes the accounting and reporting for non controlling interests that will become effective for us beginning october  the guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in the parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
it also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the 
table of contents noncontrolling owners 
adoption of the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities  which is effective for us beginning october  the new guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities  ongoing assessments of control over such entities  and additional disclosures for variable interests 
we are evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations definition of terms the following discussion of results includes information about our reportable segment sales and segment or business operating profit loss before tax pbt 
segment pbt is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace income loss from operations before taxes  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
in calculating segment pbt we exclude certain items  meaning items that are significant and unusual or infrequent  as these amounts are not believed to reflect our true underlying business performance 
in addition  in calculating segment pbt we include equity in net income of affiliated companies  royalties paid by equity affiliates and minority interest but exclude interest expense  foreign currency transaction gains and losses  interest income  dividend income and unallocated corporate costs 
our chief operating decision maker uses segment pbt to evaluate changes in the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments 
we believe that this non gaap measure also assists our investors in evaluating the changes in our results and performance 
a reconciliation of segment pbt to income loss from operations is set forth within this section 
when discussing our business activities we use several terms 
the term operating expenses means fixed costs  including both fixed manufacturing costs  which includes utilities  and selling  technical and administrative expenses 
the term product mix refers to the various types and grades  or mix  of products sold in a particular business or segment during the period  and the positive or negative impact of that mix on the revenue or profitability of the business or segment 
the term lifo benefit or lifo impact includes two factors i the impact of current inventory costs being recognized immediately in cost of goods sold cogs under a last in first out method  compared to the older costs that would have been included in cogs under a first in first out method cogs impact  and ii the impact of reductions in inventory quantities  causing historical inventory costs to flow through cogs liquidation impact 
the term contract lag refers to the time lag of the price adjustments in certain of our rubber blacks supply contracts to account for changes in feedstock costs and  in some cases  changes in other relevant costs 
the term unallocated corporate costs refers to costs that are not controlled by the segments which primarily benefit corporate interests 
cabot is organized into four business segments the core segment  which is further disaggregated for financial reporting purposes into the rubber blacks and the supermetals businesses  the performance segment  the new business segment and the specialty fluids segment 
cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions the americas  which includes north and south america  europe  middle east and africa  and asia pacific  including china 
discussions of all periods reflect these structures 
our analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
unless a calendar year is specified  all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended september drivers of demand and key factors affecting profitability drivers of demand and key factors affecting our profitability differ by segment 
in our core segment  demand in the rubber blacks business is influenced on a long term basis primarily by the number of tires produced resulting from vehicle miles driven and automotive builds 
over the past several years  the rubber 
table of contents blacks business results have been driven by increases or decreases in sales volumes  changes in raw material costs  our ability to obtain sales price increases for our products commensurate with increases in raw material costs  global and regional capacity utilization  fixed cost savings achieved through restructuring and other cost saving activities  our growth in emerging markets  capacity management and technology investment  including the impact of energy utilization technology at our manufacturing facilities 
historically  the timing of sales price increases has been influenced by the time lag of pricing adjustments in our annual and long term supply contracts that contain feedstock related pricing formulas 
since  we have been actively renegotiating these contracts in an attempt to reduce this time delay and during substantially reduced the percentage of volume subject to this time lag 
in the supermetals business  longer term demand for tantalum is largely driven by the number of electronic devices produced using tantalum capacitors versus competing materials 
over the past several years capacitors have been made using higher efficiency powders that require a lower volume of tantalum powder to achieve the same capacitance  thus reducing overall demand 
profitability in recent years has largely been determined by volume changes associated with fluctuations in the electronics market  our cost of ore  our ability to implement cost reduction initiatives  a highly competitive market environment and our ability to increase prices to stabilize margins 
in our performance segment  longer term demand is driven primarily by the construction and infrastructure  automotive  electronics and consumer products industries 
in recent years  results in the performance segment have been driven by growth in emerging markets  delivering differentiated products that drive enhanced performance in customers applications  our ability to obtain value pricing for this differentiation  changes in raw material and energy costs and our ability to obtain sales price increases for our products commensurate with increases in these costs 
in our new business segment drivers of demand are specific to the various businesses 
in the inkjet colorants business  demand has been driven by a relative increase of printer platforms using our pigments at both new and existing customers and the broader adoption of inkjet technology in office and commercial printing applications 
demand in our aerogel business has been driven by an increasing number of projects using our products in the oil and gas and daylighting markets 
in recent years  demand in superior micropowders has been driven principally by the number of security taggant applications incorporating our unique and proprietary particles 
results in the new business segment have been influenced by our ability to improve the pace of revenue generation in the segment  by choosing the highest value opportunities and working with lead users in the appropriate markets  and by ensuring that the overall cost platform of the segment is sized appropriately for the opportunities 
in our specialty fluids segment  demand for cesium formate is primarily driven by the level of drilling of high pressure oil and gas wells and by the petroleum industry s acceptance of our product as a drilling and completion fluid for this application 
results in the specialty fluids segment have been driven by the size and type of jobs  the mix of rental versus sale revenue and our ability to expand the use of our fluids into regions outside of the north sea 
results for fiscal during fiscal  profitability decreased compared to fiscal the decrease was principally caused by lower volumes from weak demand and destocking in the tire  automotive  construction and electronics markets due to the global economic slowdown and credit crisis 
lower sales volumes resulted in excess levels of inventory in our rubber blacks and performance products businesses 
these inventories were not sold until later in the year when finished product prices had been adjusted downward due to falling raw material costs 
the resulting unit margin compression reduced profitability 
these factors were partially offset by contract lag and lifo benefits from lower carbon black feedstock costs and lower operating expenses from restructuring and cost saving actions implemented during fiscal we substantially improved the performance of our new business segment during the year  increasing revenue  profitability and cash flow 
our cash and liquidity position remained solid during fiscal as we significantly reduced working capital 
in september we raised million in long term public debt 
a portion of the net 
table of contents proceeds was used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes 
during the second half of fiscal we experienced sequential improvement in volumes and operating results 
the improvement was driven by a trend of increasing demand in our key end markets 
volume increases were particularly strong in emerging markets 
additionally  the unfavorable impact of older higher cost inventories on our results was significantly less in the second half of fiscal than it was in the first half 
outlook for fiscal although the improvement in volume we experienced from increasing demand in our key end markets during the second half of fiscal was positive  we remain cautiously optimistic about the speed of a full volume recovery to fiscal levels given the broader economic environment 
the actions we have taken during fiscal  including our restructuring program  and investments in emerging market capacity and energy recovery technology  position us well to benefit from a continued recovery 
we anticipate building on the progress we made in the new business segment during fiscal with opportunities for additional revenue growth 
given our success over the past several years in the specialty fluids segment at expanding the use of our fluids outside of the north sea  we are optimistic about our ability to continue this trend in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net sales and gross profit years ended september dollars in millions net sales gross profit the million decrease in sales in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was primarily due to lower volumes million from weaker demand in our key end markets resulting from the global economic downturn  lower prices million driven by lower carbon black raw material costs and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation million 
the million increase in sales in fiscal  when compared to fiscal  was primarily due to higher prices million and the benefit of foreign currency translation million 
these positive factors were partially offset by slightly lower volumes million  principally associated with the expiration in fiscal of a fixed price  fixed volume contract in the supermetals business that resulted in an unfavorable comparison for fiscal our gross profit was of net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal gross profit decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal principally due to lower volumes from weaker demand in our end markets  charges recorded as cost of sales during fiscal principally related to restructuring expenses and the unfavorable impact of older  high cost inventories in our carbon black related businesses 
these factors were partially offset by contract lag and lifo benefits resulting from lower carbon black feedstock costs  reduced operating expenses from the implementation of restructuring and cost saving actions and improved performance in our new business segment 
gross profit decreased by million in fiscal relative to fiscal as increases in raw material costs outpaced sales price increases 
this was partially offset by lower restructuring related charges recorded as cost of sales in fiscal when compared to fiscal selling and administrative expenses years ended september dollars in millions selling and administrative expenses 
table of contents selling and administrative expenses decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the decrease is principally due to restructuring and cost saving actions implemented during fiscal  partially offset by restructuring related charges 
selling and administrative expenses decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal charges related to the fiscal settlement of the federal carbon black antitrust litigation did not reoccur in fiscal  leading to a favorable comparison 
this was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation on our expenses in fiscal research and technical expenses years ended september dollars in millions research and technical expenses in fiscal  research and technical expenses decreased by million when compared to fiscal the lower expenses were principally associated with cost reduction efforts and a greater focus on the efficiency of our new business development activities 
research and technical expenses increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased spending in the performance segment for the continued development of differentiated products 
interest and dividend income years ended september dollars in millions interest and dividend income interest and dividend income decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to lower interest rates in fiscal interest and dividend income decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal due principally to lower cash balances in fiscal available for interest earning investments 
interest expense years ended september dollars in millions interest expense interest expense decreased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the decrease was due to a lower level of borrowing  as we materially reduced our debt during most of fiscal  and the benefit of lower interest rates associated with our floating rate debt 
interest expense increased by million in fiscal when compared to fiscal the increase was due principally to increases in debt levels 
other charges income years ended september dollars in millions other charges income other charges in fiscal increased by million when compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to an increased unfavorable impact from foreign currency transactions million  including from the write down in value of bolivars that had accumulated over several years in venezuela to a parallel exchange rate million 
these factors were partially offset by a reduced impact of fair market value currency hedges million and a lower impact of certain items recorded as other charges in our statement of 
table of contents operations million 
when comparing other charges of million in fiscal to other income of million in fiscal  the difference was principally attributable to foreign currency transaction gains or losses in the comparative periods driven by fluctuations in foreign currencies against the us dollar

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through long and short term borrowings and denominate our transactions in a variety of foreign currencies 
changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flows and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and all of the derivative instruments we enter into are reviewed and approved by our financial risk management committee  an internal management committee responsible for overseeing cabot s financial risk management policy 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
the derivative instruments are booked to our balance sheet at fair market value and reflects the asset or liability position as of september  if a counterparty fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract  our exposure will equal the fair value of the derivative 
generally  when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes cabot  thus creating a payment risk for cabot 
we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into these transactions with major financial institutions of investment 
table of contents grade credit rating 
as of september   the counterparties that we have executed derivatives with were rated between aa and a  inclusive  by standard and poor s 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 
interest rate risk as of september   we had long term debt  including the current portion  totaling million  which has both variable and fixed interest rate components 
we have entered into interest rate swaps as a hedge of the underlying debt instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without changing the debt instrument 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value  but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
we endeavor to maintain a certain fixed to floating interest rate mix on our long term debt 
as most of our long term debt was issued at fixed rates  we use interest rate swaps to achieve the desired fixed to floating interest rate mix 
the table below summarizes the principal terms of our interest rate swap transactions  including the notional amount of the swap  the interest rate payment we receive from and pay to our swap counterparty  the term of the transaction  and its fair market value at september  description notional amount receive pay fiscal year entered into maturity fiscal year fair market value at september  usd interest rate swaps fixed to variable usd million fixed us month libor million usd million fixed us month libor million usd million fixed us month libor foreign currency risk our international operations are subject to certain risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations and government actions 
currently  we have issued debt denominated in us dollars and then entered into cross currency swaps that exchange our dollar principal and interest payments into a currency where we expect long term  stable cash receipts

table of contents foreign currency exposures also relate to current assets and current liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary as well as the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows generated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we use short term forward contracts to minimize the exposure to foreign currency risk 
these forward contracts typically have a duration of days 
in fiscal and fiscal  none of our forward contracts were designated hedging instruments 
as of september   we had million in net notional foreign currency forward contracts  which were denominated in japanese yen  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  australian dollar and euros 
these forwards had a fair value of less than million as of september  in certain situations where we have a long term commitment denominated in a foreign currency we may enter into appropriate financial instruments in accordance with our risk management policy to hedge future cash flow exposures 
commodity risk for the calendar year  certain of our carbon black plants in europe were subject to mandatory greenhouse gas emission ghg trading schemes 
our objective is to ensure compliance with the european union eu emission trading scheme  which is based upon a cap and trade system that establishes a maximum allowable emission credit for each ton of co emitted 
european union allowances euas originate from the individual eu state s country allocation process and are issued by that country s government 
a company that has an excess of euas based on the co emissions limits may sell euas in the emission trading scheme and if they have a shortfall  a company can buy euas or certified emission reduction cer units to comply 
in order to limit the variability in cost to our european operations  we committed to current prices by entering into agreements which run from fiscal years to to purchase cers and to sell euas
