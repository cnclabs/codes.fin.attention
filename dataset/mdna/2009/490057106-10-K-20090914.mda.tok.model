item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal  we performed recalls related to our embolic protection platform  which we have since discontinued  and to the thromcat device  which was relaunched to the market 
these product recalls had an adverse affect on our net sales and operating results during fiscal in addition to lost sales directly resulting from recalls  and the direct expenses associated with such resolution  a recall may have other materially adverse  and potentially longer term effects  including a negative impact on our reputation in the marketplace with respect to these and other of our products  changes to future product marketing plans  changes to clinical trial plans  and discontinuation of the recalled products 
our use of hazardous materials exposes us to the risk of material environmental liabilities 
we use hazardous substances in our research and development and manufacturing operations  and therefore  are potentially subject to material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damages that could be caused by hazardous substance releases or exposures at or from our facility 
decontamination costs  other clean up costs and related damages or liabilities could substantially impair our business and operating results 
we are required to comply with increasingly stringent laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety  including requirements governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances 

table of contents a substantial portion of our revenue is derived directly or indirectly from international markets 
st 
jude medical derives a significant portion of its angio seal revenue from international markets 
many of our other biomaterials products are also sold by our customers in international markets 
our sales and royalties from international sales of the angio seal product line by st 
jude medical and our revenues from other international sales are subject to several risks  including the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  reimbursement policies  tariffs or other trade barriers  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  fluctuations in exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and political and economic instability 
the occurrence of any of these events could seriously harm st 
jude medical s or our future international sales 
our financial position  results of operations or cash flows may be negatively impacted by the recent financial crisis 
the recent financial troubles affecting the banking system and financial markets and the on going concerns and threats to investment banks and other financial institutions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit and equity markets 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and or customer insolvencies  and counterparty failures negatively impacting our debt and treasury operations 
our business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel 
our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel  including managerial and technical personnel 
the know how and capabilities of many of our current employees is highly specialized and difficult to replicate or replace in short timeframes 
we compete for key personnel with other medical device companies  healthcare institutions  and other organizations 
our ability to maintain and expand our business may be impaired if we are unable to retain our current key personnel or hire or retain other qualified personnel in the future 
our failure to expand our management systems and controls to support anticipated growth or integrate future acquisitions could seriously harm our operating results and business 
our operations are expanding and we expect this trend to continue as we execute our business strategy 
executing our business plan has placed significant demands on management and our administrative  operational  information technology  manufacturing  financial and personnel resources 
accordingly  our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational  customer support and financial control systems  and effectively expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may not be able to manage our growth successfully 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or harm our operating results 
we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
the process of integrating any acquired business  technology  service or product 
table of contents into our business and operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures 
integration of any acquired company also may consume much of our management s time and attention that could otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
furthermore  we may be unable to identify  negotiate or finance future acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary substantially in the future as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including ordering patterns by our customers partners  the focus and resources that our customers partners place on developing marketing the products that we develop and manufacture  acceptance of the products we develop and manufacture in the end user marketplace  our ability to attract partners for our biomaterials products and technologies  our efforts to gain european ce mark and fda approval for biomaterials and endovascular devices  the loss of significant orders  changes in our relationship with st 
jude medical and other major customers  establishment of strategic alliances or acquisitions  timely implementation of new and improved products  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  reimbursement rates for our products  fluctuations in exchange rates  and changes in the competitive environment 
you should not rely upon our results of operations for any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
our products are subject to clinical trials  which may delay commercialization of our products and may impact our use of time and resources in a material manner 
many of our products are subject to clinical trials  which must be conducted before our products can be marketed 
these trials are for the purpose of confirming the safety and effectiveness of the product 
we try to plan clinical trials prudently  but there is no guarantee that a proper balance of speed and testing will be made in each case 
the length of time for each clinical trial may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and intended use of the product 
delays associated with products for which we are conducting clinical trials may cause us to incur additional expenses 
further  we may be affected by delays in clinical testing of certain products of our strategic partners  over which we may have no control 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us  by our strategic partners  by our competitors or by other third parties  or the market s perception of this clinical data  may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals  our position in  and share of  the markets in which we participate and our business  financial condition  results of operations or future prospects 

table of contents risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to protect our patents and proprietary rights  our reputation and competitiveness in the marketplace may be materially damaged 
we regard our patents  biomaterials trade secrets and other intellectual property as important to our success 
we rely upon patent law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and license agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
although we have registered certain of our patents with applicable international governmental authorities  effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available  and we have not sought protection for our intellectual property in every country where our products may be sold 
the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to ensure that third parties will not infringe or otherwise violate our patents or similar proprietary rights 
furthermore  patents are of limited duration and may not provide protection for the entire useful life of a product or product line 
we may be accused of infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and any related litigation could materially damage our operating results and business 
third parties may claim that we have violated their intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings brought against us could prohibit us from selling our products  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
the costs associated with these license arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the necessary licenses may not be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
the validity of our patents may be challenged by a competitor 
third parties may claim that one of our patents is invalid based on their prior disclosure or that of another party  whether such disclosure is in a patent application or not 
this type of challenge may be made in any country where our patents are issued 
while we undertake to search the prior art  there is no guarantee that we find all existing incidences of disclosure of devices or technologies related to our inventions 
any of these claims  with or without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel 
we do not own or control the use of the angio seal device trademark 
the term angio seal is a trademark of st 
jude medical 
all goodwill generated by the marketing and sales of devices bearing the angio seal trademark belongs to st 
jude medical and not to us 
should the st 
jude medical license agreements terminate  we would not have the right to call any of our products angio seal unless we purchase or license the trademark from st 
jude medical 
risks related to our industry we may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of medical products involve an inherent risk that human subjects in clinical testing or consumers of the products may suffer serious bodily injury or death due to side effects or other unintended negative reactions to our products 
accordingly  the clinical testing  manufacture and sale of our products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
the medical device industry in general has been subject to significant product liability litigation 
any product liability claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  reduced sales  significant liabilities and diversion of our management s time  attention and resources 
we cannot be sure that our product liability insurance coverage is adequate or that it will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents we face uncertainty relating to third party reimbursement for our products 
we could be seriously harmed by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental or private healthcare payers  particularly to the extent any changes affect reimbursement for catheterization procedures in which our angio seal products are used 
physicians  hospitals and other users of our products may fail to obtain sufficient reimbursement from healthcare payers for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes may occur in governmental and private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for these procedures 
the decision by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms not to reimburse for treatment of asymptomatic patients suffering from carotid artery disease was a major factor in our decision not to continue to commercialize our embolic protection product line 
further  there have been  and continue to be  proposals by legislators  regulators and third party payors to keep healthcare costs down 
certain proposals  if passed  would impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products  or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or third party payors 
these limitations  and other changes to reimbursement policy  could harm our business 
president obama and members of congress have recently proposed significant reforms to the us healthcare system 
both the us senate and house of representatives have conducted hearings about us healthcare reform 
the obama administration s fiscal year budget included proposals to limit medicare payments and increase taxes 
in addition  members of congress have proposed a public government health insurance option to compete with private plans  health insurance co ops and other publicly sponsored healthcare measures 
various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level 
we cannot predict what healthcare initiatives  if any  will be implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us  any of our strategic partners and customers  or any of our competitors 
however  an expansion in government s role in the us healthcare industry may lower reimbursements for our products  and or reduce medical procedure volumes  which could materially adversely affect our business 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products or cause us to withdraw products from certain markets 
our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to obtain the approval of the fda and international agencies before we can market and sell new products  satisfy these agencies requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials in connection with our existing products  comply with all applicable design and manufacturing regulations  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products 
furthermore  we may be subject to sanctions  including temporary or permanent suspension of operations  product recalls and marketing restrictions if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations pertaining to our business 
we are also required to demonstrate compliance with the fda s quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through pre approval and periodic post approval inspections 
these regulations relate to product testing  vendor qualification  manufacturing control  design control and quality assurance  as well as the maintenance of records and documentation 
if we are found to be out of compliance with fda regulations  it could be costly and difficult for us to correct the non compliances and could seriously harm our business 
the fda and international regulatory agencies may also limit the indications for which our products are promoted 
these regulatory agencies may restrict or withdraw approvals if information becomes available to support this action  which could include actions based on sourcing of animal derived tissue 

table of contents in addition  regulations regarding the development  manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future change  including the adoption of more rigorous regulation 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  those changes might have on our business  the businesses of our strategic partners  or the businesses of our competitors 
risks related to our securities the trading price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate substantially in the future 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including changes in our own forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts  our customers and licensees ability to meet or exceed the forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  our ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors  quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  announcements regarding clinical activities or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the medical device industry  price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical device companies  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the market for our stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
as a result  our stockholders may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price at which they purchase them 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if any securities litigation is initiated against us  with or without merit  we could incur substantial costs  and our management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation  third amended and restated bylaws  stockholders rights plan and delaware law may discourage an attempt to acquire our company 
provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation  third amended and restated bylaws  stockholders rights plan and delaware law may render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire our company  even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in particular  our stockholders rights plan  adopted in june  may cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors

overview kensey nash corporation is a medical device company known for innovative product development and unique technology in the fields of resorbable biomaterials and endovascular devices used in a wide variety of medical procedures 
we provide an extensive range of products into multiple medical markets  primarily in the cardiology  orthopaedic  sports medicine  spine  endovascular and general surgery markets 
most of the products are based on our significant expertise in the design  development  manufacturing and processing of resorbable biomaterials 
we sell our products through strategic partners and do not sell direct to the end user 
we have also developed and commercialized a series of innovative endovascular products and completed the sale of these product lines to spectranetics in may although we sold this portfolio of products to spectranetics  we still participate in this market through a manufacturing and licensing agreement and a development and regulatory services agreement  which were entered into in connection with the sale transaction see below for additional discussion 
our revenues consist of two components net sales  which include biomaterials sales and endovascular sales  and royalty income 
net sales biomaterials sales sales of biomaterial orthopaedic products  including products with applications primarily in the sports medicine and spine markets  and the sale of angio seal components to st 
jude medical continue to be our primary source of sales 
the table below shows the five year trend in our orthopaedic product sales and angio seal component sales fiscal year ended change fy vs fy in thousands sales of orthopaedic products angio seal components other products total net sales biomaterials our orthopaedic product sales increased in fiscal from fiscal this was due to an increase in sales of our current product lines  specifically in our spine product portfolio  in part due to an increase in our customer base and new product lines for our current customers 
we expect sales of our orthopaedic products to increase at a modest growth rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to our application of resources and focus on new business development  new technologies  and innovation for our current customers  specific to continued success with new product launches 

table of contents our net sales in the orthopaedic portion of our business are dependent on several factors  including the success of our current partners in the orthopaedic markets of sports medicine  spine and extremities  the continued acceptance of biomaterials based products in these markets  as well as expanded future acceptance of such products  and our ability to offer new products and technologies and to attract new partners in these markets 
due to these dependencies  and or other factors  sales to our orthopaedic customers can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we manufacture two of the key resorbable components of the angio seal device for st 
jude medical  of their supply requirements for the collagen plug and at least of their requirements for the polymer anchors  under a supply contract that expires in december sales to st 
jude medical are highly dependent on ordering patterns of components used in the manufacturing of the angio seal device by st 
jude medical and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this variation in ordering patterns is evidenced by our component sales growth of in our fiscal year ended june  over the comparable prior fiscal year  compared to the decline in st 
jude medical s end user sales  including the impact of foreign currency exchange  of during the same period 
endovascular sales over the last several years  we have devoted significant resources to developing and bringing proprietary endovascular products to market in the us and europe 
these products are focused in the emerging market segments of thrombus blood clot management and chronic total occlusions ctos a complete vessel blockage occurring in both coronary and peripheral vessels  and are sold primarily to interventional cardiologists  but may also be used by interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons 
net sales of endovascular products decreased to of our total net sales in fiscal compared to of our total net sales in fiscal fiscal represented the first fiscal year of endovascular product sales to spectranetics following our completion of the sale of our endovascular business in may spectranetics is exclusively responsible for worldwide sales and marketing of the entire endovascular product line 
these sales to spectranetics are at a reduced transfer price compared to the direct to market price reflected in our historical sales figures 
the decrease in net endovascular sales in fiscal compared to fiscal is a direct result of this reduced transfer price to spectranetics  compared to the direct to market price reflected in fiscal figures  as our overall net unit sales to spectranetics increased compared to our end user unit sales for the same period of the prior fiscal year 
we expect that our related net endovascular sales will be declining over the next two years 
see item business overview our endovascular business 
royalty income we also derive a significant portion of our revenue and profitability from royalty income from proprietary products that we have developed or co developed 
angio seal royalty income 
our company was the inventor and original developer of the angio seal device  a vascular closure device that reduces recovery time and enhances patient comfort following both diagnostic and therapeutic cardiovascular catheterizations 
st 
jude medical has the exclusive worldwide rights for the development  manufacturing and sales and marketing of the angio seal device  pursuant to an agreement  which provides us with an approximate royalty on all end user product sales 
we anticipate that sales of the angio seal device by st 
jude medical will continue to grow at a modest growth rate  based on forecasted continued procedure growth  st 
jude medical s continued expansion in international markets and marketing new generations of the product  including most recently  the introduction of the evolution device 
royalty income earned from st 
jude medical in fiscal was adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange  as compared to foreign currency exchange in the comparable prior year period 

table of contents vitoss foam  vitoss  and vitoss bioactive foam royalty income 
since  we have partnered with orthovita to co develop and commercialize a series of unique and proprietary bone void filler products  branded vitoss foam  the first of which was launched in march  and the most recent  vitoss bioactive foam technology  which was launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal we receive a fixed royalty on orthovita s end user sales of vitoss foam and vitoss bioactive foam products  which are targeted for use in the orthopaedic market 
in addition  in august  we entered into an agreement to acquire the proprietary rights of a third party inventor of the vitoss technology for million the assignment agreement 
under the assignment agreement  we receive an additional royalty from orthovita on the end user sales of all orthovita products containing the vitoss technology  up to a total royalty to be received of million  with approximately  received in fiscal and million remaining to be received as of june  we believe the unique technology associated with the vitoss foam and vitoss bioactive foam products and the growing orthopaedic market will result in the orthovita component of our royalty income becoming more significant over the next fiscal year 
we have other royalty generating relationships  none of which materially contributes to revenue at this time  but which we expect to provide increased revenue as the related products gain market acceptance and additional products are commercialized

stock based compensation expense consists of a stock options granted to employees  non employee members of our board of directors  executive officers and non employee outside consultants  b nonvested stock awards ie  restricted stock granted to non employee members of our board of directors  an executive officer and a non employee outside consultant  and c cash settled stock appreciation rights sars granted to executive officers and other non executive employees of our company 
we cannot predict the market value of our common stock at the time of exercise for these grants  nor the magnitude of exercises at any particular time over the terms of these grants 
our cash settled sars have been  and will continue to be  remeasured at each reporting period until all awards are settled 
fluctuations in the fair value of a liability award are recorded as increases or decreases in compensation cost  either immediately or over the remaining service period  depending on the vested status of the award 
total stock based compensation expense for fiscal was impacted primarily by the amortized expense related to two years of equity grants  as well as expense resulting from unfavorable adjustments in the fair value of our cash settled sars  which were remeasured based on  among other factors  our closing stock price on june  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information concerning our stock based compensation

acceleration of stock awards as we publicly announced on september   there was a change in control as defined in our fifth amended and restated kensey nash corporation employee incentive compensation plan the kensey nash corporation employee incentive compensation plan  as amended through the relevant date  the employee plan  due to the purchase in the open market by an institutional investor of more than of our shares of outstanding stock 
as a result  all outstanding unvested stock options  stock appreciation rights and nonvested stock held by officers  employees  directors and others under this plan automatically became vested and  in the case of options and stock appreciation rights  exercisable in full 
the accelerated vesting resulted in a non cash charge of approximately million primarily during the quarter ended september  of fiscal the charge represented a significant portion of our operating expenses in fiscal  and  therefore  we have disclosed in the table above under stock based compensation the amount related to the acceleration of stock based compensation charges included within each operating expense category of our income statement for the fiscal year ended june  the acceleration removed all future equity compensation expense related to the then outstanding stock options and nonvested shares under the plan as of the date of acceleration 
however  all cash settled sars  including the rights in which the vesting was accelerated  continue to be marked to market on a quarterly basis and equity compensation expense is incurred with respect to all new stock compensation awards granted after this event 
discontinuance of embolic protection platform as announced on july   we made a strategic decision to cease all activities related to our embolic protection platform and recorded certain charges during fiscal and related to this discontinuance 

table of contents critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for investments in debt and equity securities  valuation of financial instruments  inventory valuation and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  which superseded sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
we also follow the provisions of emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf  for collaborative arrangements containing multiple revenue elements that were entered into  or materially amended  after june  sales revenue 
sales revenue is generally recognized when the related product is shipped or the service is completed 
advance payments received for products or services are generally recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized when the product is shipped or services are performed  the timing of the performance of such services could be subjective 
we reduce sales for estimated customer returns  discounts and other allowances  if applicable 
our products are primarily manufactured according to our customers specifications and are subject to return only for failure to meet those specifications 
royalty revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized as the related product is sold by our customers to end users 
we recognize substantially all of our royalty revenue at the end of each month  in accordance with our customer agreements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information concerning our royalty revenue recognition 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we use various forms of equity compensation  including stock options  nonvested stock grants  and cash settled sars  as a major part of our compensation programs to retain and provide incentives to our top management team members and other employees 
fair value of option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses weighted average assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock  and other factors 
we use historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of options is derived from historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasuries with constant maturities in effect at the time of grant 
nonvested stock awards ie restricted stock granted to non employee members of our board of directors  executive officers and a non employee consultant are accounted for using the fair value method under sfas r 
fair value for nonvested stock grants is based upon the closing price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
cash settled sars awarded in stock based payment transactions are accounted for under sfas r  which classifies these awards as liabilities 
accordingly  we record these awards as a component of other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of each sar is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses weighted average assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock  as well as other factors 
for liability awards  the fair value of the award  which determines the measurement of the liability on our consolidated balance sheet  is remeasured at each reporting period until the award is settled 
fluctuations in the fair value of the liability award are recorded as increases or decreases in compensation cost  either immediately or over the remaining service period  depending on the vested status of the award 
we use historical data to estimate employee termination within the valuation model  employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes

fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp 
we have classified our entire investment portfolio as available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets and report the portfolio at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in stockholders equity and realized gains and losses in other income 
we currently have investment securities with fair values that are less than their amortized cost and therefore contain unrealized losses 
we have evaluated these securities and have determined that the decline in value is not related to any company or industry specific event 
we have the intent and the ability to hold each of these investments until a recovery of the fair value 
there is no current requirement to sell any of these investments 
we anticipate full recovery of amortized costs with respect to these securities at maturity or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment 
revisions to our classification of these investments and or a determination other than the anticipation of a full recovery of the amortized costs at maturity or sooner could result in our realizing gains and losses on these investments and  therefore  have a material impact on our financial statements

sfas establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques 
categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussion regarding the fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
adjustments to inventory are made at the individual part level for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired balances  to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality concerns 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if any of these factors differ from our estimates 
income taxes 
in the course of estimating our estimated annual effective tax rate and recording our quarterly income tax provisions  we consider many factors  including our expected earnings  state income tax apportionment  estimated research and development tax credits  non taxable interest income and other estimates 
material changes in  or differences from  these estimates could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate

biomaterials sales 
biomaterials sales were million in fiscal  a increase compared to million in fiscal biomaterials sales includes revenue recognized from products shipped as well as revenue generated from product development programs with biomaterials customers

sports medicine product sales of million decreased by from million in fiscal sports medicine product sales in fiscal were positively impacted due to new product launches and stronger sales of existing products  however were offset by exceptionally high orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal from two major customers and current economic conditions  which negatively impacted customer inventory levels

endovascular sales were million in fiscal  a decrease compared to sales of million in fiscal endovascular sales include revenue recognized from products shipped  as well as milestone revenue recognized from product development programs with spectranetics 
during fiscal  endovascular product sales to spectranetics were at a reduced transfer price compared to the direct to market price reflected in our historical sales figures 
the decrease in endovascular sales in fiscal from fiscal is a direct result of this reduced transfer price  as overall net unit sales to spectranetics increased as compared to fiscal end user unit sales

gross margin on net sales in fiscal was compared to gross margin on net sales of in fiscal the increase in gross margin in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was due in part to product mix  as well as higher volumes  process improvements and revenue generated from product development programs with biomaterials customers 
the gross margin in the same period of the prior fiscal year was negatively affected by start up costs associated with the safe cross product line  as we initiated and continued to refine the manufacturing process on this new product line 
also negatively impacting the gross margin in the prior fiscal year by approximately were the charges related to the sale of our endovascular division  the acceleration of stock based awards and the discontinuance of the embolic protection platform

these increases are offset by an  charge incurred for the acceleration of stock based awards in the prior fiscal year  which was not applicable to fiscal during fiscal  we furthered our cartilage preclinical studies in preparation for a us clinical trial  and  in february  filed an ide submission for a cartilage us clinical trial 
research and development expenses were of our total revenues for each of the fiscal years ended and we believe research and development expenditures in total as a percentage of revenue will increase slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe that this expected increase will primarily be the result of our increased focus on our cartilage repair product  with efforts dedicated to clinical programs to further this product toward achieving regulatory approvals  and additional stock based compensation expense primarily due to the fiscal acceleration of stock awards

the exercise price of each sar is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant

investment portfolio our investment portfolio consists of high quality municipal securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities ranging from less than one year to approximately four years 
we mitigate default risk by investing in what we believe are safe and high credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with secondary or resale markets 
we have an audit committee approved investment strategy  which currently limits the duration and types of our investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and decreases in market value if interest rates increase 
as of june   our total investment portfolio consisted of approximately million of investments 
while our investments may be sold at any time because the portfolio includes available for sale marketable securities with secondary or resale markets  we generally hold securities until the earlier of their call date or their maturity 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
we review our investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment 
we have the ability and intent to hold each of these investments until a recovery of their respective fair values  which may be at maturity  and there is no current requirement to sell any of these investments

our objective and strategy for undertaking the swap was to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows and interest expense associated with the future interest rate payments under the mortgage and to reduce our interest rate risk in the event of an unfavorable interest rate environment 
we currently utilize the hypothetical derivative method in determining the hedge effectiveness of the hedged item each period 
therefore  we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates 
if the conditions underlying the swap or the hedge item change  there is a risk that our hedged item would be deemed an ineffective hedge  and therefore  we would record changes in the fair value of the swap within our consolidated statements of income  as well as our consolidated statements of cash flows
