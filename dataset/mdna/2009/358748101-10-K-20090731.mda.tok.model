the minimum wage for non tipped employees increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was increased to per hour effective january  and to per hour on january  in accordance with the mandate s provision to annually adjust for the rate of inflation 
the minimum wage for tipped employees increased percent from per hour to per hour beginning january  it was increased to per hour on january  and to per hour on january  in accordance with the inflation provision of the mandate 
more than two thirds of the company s payroll costs are incurred in ohio 
the effects of paying the required higher hourly rates of pay have effectively been countered through the combination of higher menu prices charged to customers and reductions in the number of hours that employees are permitted to work 
further reductions in employee hours have been implemented to offset the effect of what would otherwise have been a  increase in annual payroll costs attributable to the january  increase 
the federal minimum wage for non tipped employees increased from per hour to per hour in july it was increased to per hour in july and to per hour in july the rate for tipped employees was not changed by the federal legislation  remaining at per hour 
additional reductions in scheduled labor hours will likely be implemented to combat the effects of the federal increase in july without the further reductions in labor hours  annual payroll costs would increase by approximately  results of operations sales the company s sales are primarily generated through the operation of big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants 
big boy sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators and the sale of big boy s signature brand tartar sauce to grocery stores 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases

year fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year marked the twelfth consecutive year that big boy same store sales increases have been achieved 
the same store sales improvement was driven by higher average guest checks  primarily the result of menu price increases 
the higher menu prices likely contributed to the continuing trend in lower customer traffic 
customer counts in same stores were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year however  the fourth quarter of fiscal year experienced a percent increase in customer counts  driven by mild winter weather and a new marketing campaign that focused on customers dining experiences while continuing to emphasize favorite things 
the big boy same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  implemented respectively during the third quarters of fiscal years  and the percent increase in the third quarter of fiscal year included a specific provision targeted to offset costs associated with minimum wage increases

year fiscal fiscal the same store sales increase that was achieved in fiscal year ended a streak of four consecutive years of same store sales declines 
the same store sales improvement in fiscal year was driven by higher average guest checks  the result of menu price increases  favorable winter weather and a national media buying program launched by the company s franchisor in january that allowed cable television spots to run in all of the company s markets 
previously  the company could only place television spots in markets where sales volumes could justify the cost 
as with big boy  higher menu prices have likely contributed to the continuation of lower customer counts that have been experienced 
same store customer counts were percent lower in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  which was percent lower than fiscal year the golden corral same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of

gross profit gross profit for the big boy segment includes wholesale sales and cost of wholesale sales 
gross profit differs from restaurant level profit discussed in note g segment information to the consolidated financial statements  as advertising expense and impairment of asset losses are charged against restaurant level profit 
gross profit for both operating segments is shown below 
fiscal year weeks fiscal year fiscal year in thousands big boy gross profit golden corral gross profit total gross profit the operating percentages shown in the following table are percentages of total sales  including big boy wholesale sales 
the table supplements the discussion that follows  which addresses cost of sales for both the big boy and golden corral reporting segments  including food cost  payroll and other operating costs

the company actively manages the effect of changing commodity prices with changes to the big boy menu mix and effective selection and rotation of items served on the golden corral buffet  together with periodic increases in menu prices 
rapid escalations in costs  especially for proteins such as pork  beef  poultry and fish that were experienced in and  can be problematic to effective menu management  as food cost percentages rise despite higher prices being charged to customers 
food cost percentages in the golden corral segment are much higher than big boy because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral segment  as well as its use of steak as an item featured daily on the buffet 
mandated increases in the minimum wage have been effectively mitigated by the higher menu prices being charged and management s resolve to reduce the number of hours worked by hourly paid employees  as can be seen in the above table as payroll and related costs as a percentage of sales have either been holding steady or improving in both big boy and golden corral 
although there is no seasonal fluctuation in employment levels  hours worked have always been managed closely according to individual restaurant sales patterns 
payroll related costs include statutory provisions for social security and medicare  unemployment and workers compensation  along with voluntary benefits provided by the company such as medical insurance and defined benefit pension plans 

table of contents the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
management performs a comprehensive review each fiscal quarter and adjusts the self insurance reserves as deemed appropriate based on claims experience 
favorable adjustments were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the trend in smaller adjustments has been effected by vast improvements in claims experience  the result of active claims management and post accident drug testing  which have allowed lower rates as a percentage of payroll to be used to accrue initial reserves 
after steady medical insurance premiums in calendar years and  costs escalated by almost percent for the plan year that runs january  through december  the company will absorb to percent of the estimated million cost in  with employees being asked to contribute the other to percent 
net periodic pension cost was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the higher cost in fiscal year is due to the combination of unfavorable asset returns plus the recognition of a  settlement loss  which was triggered when lump sum payments from the hourly pension plan exceeded the sum of service cost and interest cost for the year 
pension cost for fiscal year is currently estimated at over  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was percent in fiscal years  and the assumption will remain at percent for the determination of pension costs for fiscal year the discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions to compute pension costs was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and was percent in fiscal year the rate for fiscal year will be percent 
the rate of compensation increase for pension costs was percent in each of fiscal years  and it will be lowered to percent for fiscal year although no contributions have been needed to satisfy minimum legal funding requirements during the last three years  discretionary contributions made by the company to these plans were  in each of fiscal years  and discretionary contributions for fiscal year are currently being planned at a level of  future funding of the pension plans largely depends upon the performance of investments that are held in trusts that have been established for the plans 
equity securities comprise percent of the target allocation of the plans assets 
the recent market volatility that caused significant declines in the market values of these securities is likely to have a material adverse effect upon future funding requirements and result in the recognition of much higher net periodic pension costs in future years 
pension accounting standards require the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension plans to be recognized as an asset or liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and projected benefit obligations  which includes a projection of future salary increases 
the company s pension plans were underfunded as of june   the direct result of significant declines in the market values of equity securities that are held in the pension trust 
a  reduction in the company s equity  net of tax  was required to establish the necessary  liability in the company s balance sheet  effected through a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income 
the hourly pension plan was amended on july  to freeze all future accruals for credited service under the plan after august  the plan had previously been closed to all hourly paid restaurant employees hired after december  the salaried pension plan was amended on july  to close entry into the plan to salaried employees hired after june  salaried employees hired before june  will continue to participate in the plan and be credited with normal benefits for years of service 
other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  plus costs relating to field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  new restaurant opening costs and many other restaurant operating costs 
since most of these expenses tend to be fixed costs  the percentages shown in the above table are greatly affected by changes in same store sales levels 
opening costs can have a significant impact on the percentages 
opening cost charges for big boy restaurants for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs for fiscal years  and were zero   and  respectively 
there should be no opening costs for golden corral in fiscal year other operating costs in fiscal year included a charge of  to write down the carrying value of a big boy restaurant that permanently ceased operations on may  the percentage reductions in golden corral s other operating costs in fiscal year are largely from lower depreciation charges  the result of a million impairment of assets charge that was taken at the end of fiscal 
table of contents year to lower carrying costs of three restaurants 
although the fiscal year improvement in percentages was also aided by higher sales  it should be noted that other operating costs for the golden corral segment are a much higher percentage of sales than big boy because sales volumes generally remain below expectations 
operating profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit  administrative and advertising expense is subtracted from gross profit  while franchise fees and other revenue are added to it 
gains and losses from the sale of real property  if any  are then respectively added or subtracted 
litigation settlements and charges for impairment of assets if any are also included in the measure of operating profit 
administrative and advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and advertising expense represents the largest component of these costs 
spending for advertising and marketing programs is proportionate to sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of big boy and golden corral sales on advertising and marketing 
advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and all other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and the chief executive officer s incentive compensation was included in other administrative costs as follows  zero and  respectively was accrued in fiscal years  and stock based compensation costs included in other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and fiscal year included a charge in other administrative costs of  to write off deposits for golden corral development rights 
revenue from franchise fees is based upon sales volumes generated by big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales and are recorded on the accrual method as earned 
as of june   big boy restaurants were licensed to other operators and paying fees to the company 
no new licensed big boy restaurants have opened during any of the periods presented in this md a  two closed during fiscal year other revenue also includes certain other fees earned from licensed restaurants along with minor amounts of rent and investment income 
gains and losses from the sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that routinely arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life 
abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 
total gains from the sale of real property in fiscal year amounted to  on aggregate proceeds of  the totals are primarily attributable to the disposition of a big boy restaurant in the first quarter of fiscal year that had ceased operations in june  the gain from which was  on proceeds of  gains from the sale of real property amounted to  during fiscal year  resulting from the dispositions of three low volume big boy restaurants that had ceased operations respectively in january  april and june during fiscal year  a gain of  was recorded from the sale of an older big boy restaurant that had closed in october on march   the company received a check for  representing full and final settlement of the arbitration award in the long standing case against the general contractor that had constructed a golden corral restaurant for the company in canton  ohio in  which the company had to subsequently demolish due to defective construction by the contractor 
in addition to the cash received  the company recorded an additional credit to earnings of  to reverse a liability that had represented the general contractor s claim against the company for the outstanding contract balance  which was eliminated when the award was made final 
the combined sum resulted in  being credited to pretax earnings in the third quarter of fiscal year the test for impairment of assets completed at the end of fiscal year determined that the carrying values of three golden corral restaurant locations exceeded expected future cash flows to be generated by the underlying assets 
as a result  a non cash pretax charge of  was recorded to lower the carrying values to fair values 
the total charge reflected in the consolidated statement of earnings includes impairment losses of  for intangible assets associated with unamortized initial franchise fees relating to the three impaired restaurants 
the three impaired restaurants continue to operate 
no significant charges for impairment of assets were recorded during either fiscal year or fiscal year 
table of contents interest expense interest expense was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and the decreasing trend is primarily the result of lower debt levels and lower variable interest rates combined with much lower interest charges associated with capitalized leases 
there are no longer any restaurant facilities leased by the company that are required to be classified as capital lease obligations under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips and the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year also includes the effect of the statutory elimination of corporate income tax in the state of ohio

liquidity and capital resources sources of funds food sales to restaurant customers provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds from sales are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in cash or are settled by debit or credit cards 
the primary source of cash provided by operating activities is net earnings plus depreciation and impairment of assets  if any 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against credit lines  proceeds received when stock options are exercised and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion and dividends 
working capital practices the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations  and credit lines remain readily available  the use of this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table

primarily consists of commitments for certain food and beverage items  plus capital projects including commitments to purchase real property  if any 
deferred compensation liability 
the working capital deficit was  as of june  the deficit was  as of june  the improvement in the deficit was driven primarily by several factors 
the current portion of long term debt at june  is almost  lower than it was at june  advance delivery of certain inventory was taken during fiscal year in order to secure availability of certain product at favorable pricing 
in addition  there are no costs related to new unit construction included in accounts payable as of june  one new big boy restaurant was under construction as of june  finally  a long standing construction payable was eliminated in fiscal year as part of a legal proceeding that was resolved during the year 
if needed to fund temporary working capital needs  a  revolving credit facility currently unused is immediately available to be drawn upon through september  a construction draw facility is also in place that allows up to  to be drawn upon through september  negotiations to renew these facilities with additional borrowing capacity are expected to be completed during the first half of fiscal year operating activities operating cash flows were  in fiscal year   higher than fiscal year and  lower than fiscal year these changes are primarily attributable to normal changes in assets and liabilities such as prepaid expenses  inventories and accounts payable  all of which fluctuate widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
management measures cash flows from the operation of the business by simply adding to net earnings certain non cash expenses such as depreciation  losses net of any gains on dispositions of assets  charges for impairment of long lived assets if any and stock based compensation cost 
the result of this approach is reflected as a sub total in the consolidated statement of cash flows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year investing activities capital spending is the principal component of the company s investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal year  which includes  for big boy restaurants and  for golden corral restaurants 
these capital expenditures consisted of new restaurant construction  site acquisitions for expansion  remodeling existing restaurants  routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays 
proceeds from the disposition of property during fiscal year amounted to  primarily resulting from the sale of an older big boy restaurant that had ceased operations in june its sale resulted in a gain of  which was reported in the first quarter of fiscal year two former big boy restaurants and four surplus land locations are currently held for sale at an aggregate asking price of  financing activities borrowing against credit lines amounted to  during fiscal year scheduled and other payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  during fiscal year regular quarterly cash dividends to shareholders were paid at a rate of 
per share  amounting to  in fiscal year another 
per share dividend was declared on june  its payment on july  was the th consecutive quarterly dividend paid by the company 
the company expects to continue its year practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends 
during fiscal year  options to purchase  shares of common stock were exercised  yielding proceeds to the company of approximately  as of june    shares granted under the company s two stock option plans remain outstanding  including  fully vested shares at a weighted average price per share 
table of contents of 
as of june   approximately  shares remained available to be granted under the stock option and incentive plan  which is net of  options granted to employees in june and  options granted in october to non employee members of the board of directors 
granting authority under the stock option plan expired on october  in january  the board of directors authorized a repurchase program under which the company may repurchase up to  shares of its common stock in the open market or through block trades over a two year period that will expire on january  the sum of  shares was acquired under the program in fiscal year at a cost of  since inception of the current authorization   shares have been acquired through june  at a cost of  other information two new big boy restaurants opened for business during fiscal year in winchester  kentucky on august  and in dayton  ohio on october  in addition  a big boy restaurant re opened in suburban cincinnati on september  in a new building that replaced an older facility  which had been taken out of service and razed in june although no new big boy restaurant construction was in progress as of june   construction was begun in june to replace an older suburban cincinnati big boy restaurant with a new building on a superior nearby site 
it is scheduled to open for business in september three other new big boy restaurants are currently scheduled to open respectively in november  february and april on land acquired by the company in fiscal year including land and land improvements  the cash required to build and equip each new big boy restaurant currently ranges from  to  the actual cost depends greatly on the price paid for the land and the cost of land improvements  which can vary widely from location to location  and whether the land is purchased or leased 
future costs will also depend on whether the present building prototype used since is constructed or whether the prototype of a second design having a smaller footprint is used  which is currently being developed for use in smaller markets 
two of the new big boy restaurants scheduled to open in fiscal year will be built using the smaller prototype 
several sites are currently being evaluated for potential acquisition and development 
as of june   any contracts that existed to acquire sites for future development were cancellable at the company s sole discretion while due diligence is pursued under the inspection period provisions of the contracts 
approximately one fifth of the big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year 
the renovations not only refresh and upgrade interior finishes  but are also designed to synchronize the interiors and exteriors of older restaurants with the newer prototype that has been used since the current average cost to renovate a typical older restaurant ranges from  to  newer prototype restaurants also receive updates when they reach five years of age  which on average currently range from  to  per restaurant 
the fiscal year remodeling budget for big boy restaurants is  in addition  certain high volume big boy restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies and whether a dining room expansion is warranted 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  and a dining room expansion can cost up to only one new golden corral restaurant has been opened in the last three years 
no further development is currently planned and there is no active search for sites on which to build 
at the end of fiscal year  management determined that the assets of three golden corral restaurant locations were impaired and a non cash pretax charge of  was recorded to lower the carrying values to fair value 
the impairment charge included  to write off unamortized franchise fees 
the three impaired restaurants remain in operation 
in april  the area development agreement with golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor was amended to lower from to twelve  the company s development rights to build future restaurants 
as a result  the company wrote off franchise fee deposits totaling  in fiscal year eleven golden corral restaurants are scheduled to be renovated in fiscal year in addition  carpeting is typically replaced in each restaurant every two and half years on average 
the fiscal year remodeling budget  including carpeting costs  is approximately the company s policy is to own the land on which it builds new restaurants 
however  it is often necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
seven of the golden corral restaurants now in operation were built on leased land 
three big boy restaurants opened since were also built on leased land 
all of these 
table of contents leases have been accounted for as operating leases pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended 
as of june   restaurants were in operation on non owned premises  which are covered by lease agreements consisting of operating leases sixteen are for big boy and seven are for golden corrals and five month to month arrangements 
the month to month arrangements are for five big boy restaurant facilities that are continuing to be occupied until the company acquires the properties from the landlord for certain amounts specified in the lease agreements  which taken together amount to  the landlord disputes the amount  claiming the company must purchase the properties for a larger amount based on alternative values and market appraisal values 
the matter is the subject of litigation 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company believes the following to be its critical accounting policies 
self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  the company reviews claims valued by its third party administrator tpa and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  the company reviews it in light of historical claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement  and any other facts that might provide guidance in determining ultimate value of individual claims 
unexpected changes in any of these or other factors could result in actual costs differing materially from initial projections or values presently carried in the self insurance reserves 
pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
an informal committee consisting of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
assets of the pension plans are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
to determine the long term rate of return on plan assets  the committee looks at the target asset allocation of plan assets and determines the expected return on each asset class 
the expected returns for each asset class are combined and rounded to the nearest basis points to determine the overall expected return on assets 
the committee determines the discount rate by looking at the projected future benefit payments and matches those to spot rates based on yields of high grade corporate bonds 
a single discount rate is selected  and then rounded to the nearest basis points  which produces the same present value as the various spot rates 
future funding of the pension plans largely depends upon the performance of investments held in trusts that have been established for the plans 
equity securities comprise percent of the target allocation of the plans assets 
the recent market volatility that resulted in significant declines in the market values of these securities could have a 
table of contents material adverse effect upon future funding requirements and result in the recognition of much higher net periodic pension costs in future years 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property and equipment typically approximates to percent of the company s total assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
capitalization policies are continually monitored to assure they remain appropriate 
management considers a history of cash flow losses on a restaurant by restaurant basis to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
carrying values of property and equipment are tested for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
when undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than carrying values  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which carrying values exceed the greater of the net present value of the future cash flow stream or a floor value 
future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may influence operating performance  which affect cash flows 
floor values are generally determined by opinions of value provided by real estate brokers and or management s judgment as developed through its experience in disposing of property 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor performance 
the final impairment amount can be significantly different from the initial charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from initial estimates of floor values 
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of its debt is currently financed with fixed interest rates 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
any cash equivalents maintained by the company have original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not use foreign currency 
big boy restaurants utilize centralized purchasing and food preparation  which is provided through the company s commissary and food manufacturing plant 
the company believes the commissary operation ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and creates efficiencies that ultimately result in lower food and supply costs 
the commissary operation does not supply golden corral restaurants 
commodity pricing affects the cost of many of the company s food products 
commodity pricing can be extremely volatile  affected by many factors outside the company s control  including import and export restrictions  the influence of currency markets relative to the us dollar  supply versus demand  production levels and the impact that adverse weather conditions may have on crop yields 
certain commodities purchased by the commissary  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
these contracts are normally for periods of one year or less but may have longer terms if favorable long term pricing becomes available 
food supplies are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers  which mitigates the company s overall commodity cost risk 
quality  timeliness of deliveries and price are the principal determinants of source 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing
