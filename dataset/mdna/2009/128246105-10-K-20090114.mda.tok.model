item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business included in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  prepared avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states and elsewhere in the world 
our history and expertise in handling california grown avocados has allowed us to develop a reputation of delivering quality products  at competitive prices  while providing competitive returns to our growers 
this reputation has enabled us to expand our product offerings to include avocados sourced on an international basis  prepared avocado products  and other perishable foods 
we report our operations in two different business segments fresh products and processed products 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we report our financial results on a november to october fiscal year basis to coincide with the california avocado harvest season 
on october   we completed a series of transactions whereby common and preferred shareholders of calavo growers of california  an agricultural marketing cooperative association  exchanged all of their outstanding shares for shares of our common stock 
concurrently with this transaction  the cooperative was merged into us with calavo emerging as the surviving entity 
these transactions had the effect of converting the legal structure of the business from a non profit cooperative to a for profit corporation 
the merger and the conversion were approved on an overwhelming basis by both the cooperative s shareholders and our board of directors 
prior to the merger  the cooperative reported results of operations as constituting either member the packing and distribution of avocados procured from either members or associate members or non member business non member business included both the processed product business and the sourcing and distribution of all crops that were not procured from the cooperative s members 
our fresh products business grades  sizes  packs  cools  and ripens if desired avocados for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate three packinghouses in southern california 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts to retain and recruit growers that meet our business model 
additionally  our fresh products business also procures avocados grown in mexico and chile  as well as other various commodities  including tomatoes  papayas  mushrooms  and pineapples 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that  together with certain co packers that we frequently purchase fruit from  handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market and approximately of the avocados exported from mexico to countries other than the united states during the mexican season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to increase our market share of currently sourced avocados to all accepted marketplaces 
we believe our diversified avocado sources provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing our other various commodities  such as those shown above  complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 
our processed products business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
customers include both food service industry and retail businesses and our products primarily include both frozen and cold pasteurized fresh guacamole 
cold pasteurized fresh guacamole refers to fresh guacamole product that has been treated by one of our ultra high pressure machines 
we currently have two liter ultra high pressure machines located in uruapan  michoac n  mexico uruapan 
these machines utilize ultra high pressure only ie without additives or preservatives and destroy the cells of any bacteria that could lead to spoilage or oxidation issues 
due to the long shelf life of our frozen processed products and the purity of our ultra high pressure guacamole  we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today s customers 
we believe our ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado products to our customers 
we also believe that we are positioned to expand our ultra high pressure product line to include more avocado related products  high end salsas  mangoes and other readily available fruit products 
we continue to seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
net sales of frozen products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and our fresh products business is highly seasonal and is characterized by crop volume and price changes 
furthermore  the operating results of all of our businesses  including our processed products business  have been  and will continue to be  affected by substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and processed products we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future 
recent developments dividend payment on december   we paid a per share dividend in the aggregate amount of million to shareholders of record on december  fresh packinghouse acquisition effective july  we purchased our previously leased fresh avocado packinghouse located in uruapan  michoacan  mexico for million  plus acquisition costs 
we recorded approximately million and million in land and buildings and improvements related to this transaction 
the building is currently being depreciated over a year period 
capital lease in april  we entered into a capital lease for various fixed assets related to our swedesboro  new jersey facility 
such fixed assets are included in buildings and improvements and equipment at october   totaling million and million 
depreciation expense was million  million and million for fiscal years   and  of which million was related to depreciation on capital leases 
we did not have any significant capital leases as of october  contingencies hacienda suit we are currently under examination by the mexican tax authorities hacienda for the tax year ended december  and december  we have received assessments totaling approximately million and million from hacienda related to the amount of income at our mexican subsidiary 
subsequent to that initial assessment  the hacienda offered a settlement of approximately  related to the tax year assessment  which we declined 
based primarily on discussions with legal counsel and the evaluation of our claim  we maintain our belief that the hacienda s position has no merit and that we will prevail 
accordingly  no amounts have been provided for in the financial statements as of october  we pledged our processed products building located in uruapan  michoacan  mexico as collateral to hacienda in regards to this assessment 
irs examination we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for the year ended october  we do not believe that the settlement of such examination will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
from time to time  we are also involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
term revolving credit agreement in may  we entered into a term revolving credit agreement the agreement with farm credit west  pca 
under the terms of the agreement  we are advanced funds for the purchase and installation of capital items and other corporate needs of the company 
total credit available under the agreement  which expires in february  is now million  up from million 
the credit facility contains various financial covenants  the most significant relating to working capital  tangible net worth as defined  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda as defined 
we were in compliance with all such covenants at october  business acquisitions calavo and lecil e 
cole  suzanne cole savard  guy cole  eric weinert  and lecil e 
cole and mary jeanette cole  as trustees of the lecil e 
and mary jeanette cole revocable trust dated october  the cole trust collectively  the sellers  have entered into an acquisition agreement  dated may  the acquisition agreement  which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which calavo purchased all of the outstanding shares of hawaiian sweet  inc hs and all ownership interests of hawaiian pride  llc hp 
hs and hp engage in tropical product packing and processing operations in hawaii 
the acquisition agreement provides  among other things  that as a result of the acquisition agreement  calavo shall make an initial purchase price payment in the aggregate amount of  for both entities 
calavo made the initial payment on may  calavo shall also make two additional annual payments  ranging from  to  based on certain operating results the earn out payment s  as defined 
mr 
cole is president  chief executive officer  and chairman of the board of directors of calavo 
pursuant to sfas  business combinations  we recorded approximately million as a liability related to deferred and contingent consideration to the sellers  of which million was recorded in accrued expenses  million is recorded in long term obligations  less current portion  and million as deferred tax liabilities 
total liabilities recorded as a result of the acquisition was million 
the first earn out payment to be made by calavo will be adjusted if the aggregate working capital wc of hs and hp does not equal  as of the closing date 
in the event that wc is less than  calavo shall reduce its first earn out payment by an amount equal to the difference between  and the closing date aggregate working capital of hs and hp 
in the event that wc is greater than  calavo shall increase its first earn out payment by an amount equal to the difference between  and the closing date aggregate working capital of hs and hp 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  the transaction closed on may  concurrently with the execution of the acquisition agreement  calavo and the cole trust have entered into an agreement and escrow instructions for purchase and sale of real property the real estate contract  dated the same date as the acquisition agreement  pursuant to which calavo purchased from the cole trust approximately acres of agricultural land located in pahoa  hawaii for a purchase price of  which calavo delivered on may  the real estate contract also closed on may  the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition in thousands 
we obtained third party valuations for the long term assets acquired and incurred approximately million in acquisition costs 
at may  current assets property  plant  and equipment intangible assets total assets acquired current liabilities deferred tax liabilities net assets acquired deferred consideration contingent consideration net cash paid as of may  of the  of intangible assets   was assigned to customer contract relationships with a weighted average life of years   to trade names with an average life of years and  to non competition agreements with an average life of years 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales 
the derived percentage is then applied to the current period s sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period 
the offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities 
when certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional  they are written off against this allowance 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
a change in the derived percentage would impact results of operations by approximately million 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in november  we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  a company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from management s estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
see note prior to fiscal  we recorded estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and determined that no impairment existed as of october  allowance for accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income interest income interest expense other income  net net income net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
firstly  americans are eating more avocados 
over the last years  united states us consumption of avocados has expanded at a compound annual growth rate and we do not anticipate this growth significantly changing 
we believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the united states contributes to such growth  as avocados  which are cholesterol and sodium free  are dense in fiber  vitamin b  antioxidants  potassium  folate  and contain unsaturated fat  which help lower cholesterol 
also  a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients  which avocados are rich in  help fight chronic illnesses  such as heart disease and cancer 
additionally  we believe that the demographic changes in the us will greatly impact the consumption of avocados and avocado based products 
the hispanic community currently accounts for approximately of the us population  and the total number of hispanics is estimated to triple by the year avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers  as the per capita avocado consumption in mexico is estimated to be more than seven fold that of the us we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by growth in the hispanic community and general acceptance in american cuisine 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
additionally  we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in  as interest in avocados continues to expand 
in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
this board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace  including imported and california grown fruit 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our california avocado and international avocado businesses 
during fiscal  and  on behalf of avocado growers  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the california avocado commission 
during fiscal  and  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the hass avocado board related to california avocados 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
we provide for sales returns and promotional allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience 
the following table summarizes our net sales by business segment change change dollars in thousands net sales fresh products processed products total net sales as a percentage of net sales fresh products processed products net sales for the year ended october   when compared to  increased by approximately million  or  principally as a result of an increase in both our fresh products and processed products segments 
the increase in sales related to our fresh products segment was primarily driven by an increase in sales related to mexico and california sourced avocados  tomatoes  and pineapples 
such sales increases were partially offset  however  by a decrease in sales related to chilean sourced avocados 
the increase related to our processed products segment was primarily related to an increase in our average selling price per pound 
the following tables set forth sales by product category  freight and other charges and sales incentives  by segment dollars in thousands year ended october  year ended october  fresh processed fresh processed products products total products products total third party sales california avocados imported avocados tomatoes pineapples papayas diversified products processed food service processed retail and club total fruit and product sales to third parties freight and other charges total third party sales less sales incentives total net sales to third parties intercompany sales net sales intercompany sales eliminations consolidated net sales year ended october  year ended october  fresh processed fresh processed products products total products products total third party sales california avocados imported avocados tomatoes pineapples papayas diversified products processed food service processed retail and club total fruit and product sales to third parties freight and other charges total third party sales less sales incentives total net sales to third parties intercompany sales net sales intercompany sales eliminations consolidated net sales net sales to third parties by segment exclude value added services billed by our uruapan packinghouse  uruapan processing plant and mexicali processing plant to the parent company

fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase was primarily related to an increase in sales related to mexico and california sourced avocados  tomatoes  and pineapples 
such increases were partially offset  however  by a decrease in chilean avocado sales 
sales of mexican sourced avocados increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in the average per carton selling price of mexican avocados 
the average per carton selling price of mexican avocados increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the small california avocado crop in the marketplace during fiscal  as well as the premium pricing related to our proripevip tm avocado ripening program 
the volume of mexican fruit sold decreased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
sales of pineapples and tomatoes increased million and million from fiscal to the volume of pineapples and tomatoes increased by approximately million cartons  or and million cartons  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
these increases were primarily related to our agreements with agricola belher of mexico for the tomatoes and our consignment and marketing agreement with maui pineapple company  ltd for the pineapples 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these agreements 
additionally  the average selling price  on a per carton basis  of tomatoes increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the quality of our tomatoes in the us marketplace 
sales of chilean sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of chilean fruit sold decreased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to the smaller size of the chilean avocado crop 
such decreased volume was partially offset  however  by an increase in our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  which experienced an increase of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
we attribute some of these price fluctuations to the smaller chilean and california avocado crops  as well as the delivery of such crops  in the marketplace during fiscal mexican and chilean grown avocados are primarily sold in the us  japanese  and or european marketplace 
we anticipate that the combined sales of mexican and chilean grown avocados will increase in fiscal sales of california sourced avocados increased million for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this increase was primarily related to an increase in our average selling prices of 
the pounds sold of california sourced avocados remained consistent with the same prior year period 
our market share of shipped california avocados decreased to for fiscal  when compared to a market share for the same prior year period 
based on estimates generated from the california avocado commission  we expect the california avocado crop for the season to be smaller than the crop 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were higher when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the small california avocado crop for the season 
for fiscal year  we believe that the demand for california avocados will remain strong in the us marketplace  and  as a result  such is expected to have a positive impact on sales prices 
california avocados are primarily sold in the us marketplace 
we anticipate that sales of california grown avocados will decrease in fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase was primarily related to an increase in mexican and chilean avocado sales and an increase in tomato sales  partially offset by a decrease in california avocado sales 
sales of mexican sourced avocados increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of mexican fruit sold increased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily in the us marketplace and was substantially related to an increased emphasis in the mexican avocado crop certified for export to the us  which principally stemmed from the expected  and ultimately realized  smaller california avocado crop 
additionally  the average per carton selling price of mexican avocados increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the smaller california avocado crop in the marketplace during fiscal  as well as the premium pricing related to our proripevip tm avocado ripening program 
sales of chilean sourced avocados increased million for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of chilean fruit sold increased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily related to the size of the chilean avocado crop  as well as the timing of the delivery to the united states 
our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  of chilean avocados experienced a decrease of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
we attribute some of these price fluctuations to the size and or timing of delivery of the chilean and california avocado crop in the marketplace during fiscal the volume of non brokered tomatoes increased by approximately million pounds during fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase  which accounted for the majority of the fluctuation  was primarily related to a new supplier relationship 
sales of california sourced avocados decreased million for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this decrease was primarily related a decrease in pounds of avocados sold  partially offset by an increase in our average selling prices 
the decrease in pounds was primarily related to a cyclically low california avocado crop for the season  coupled with the freeze experienced during our first fiscal quarter 
our market share of shipped california avocados decreased to for fiscal  when compared to a market share for the same prior year period 
for fiscal year  average selling prices  on a per carton basis  for california avocados were higher when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the aforementioned smaller california avocado crop for the season 
processed products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to an increase in the net selling price totaling per product pound sold  or  partially offset by a decrease of million pounds of product sold  or 
the increase in our net average selling price primarily relates to a change in our product mix 
during fiscal year  the decrease in pounds sold primarily relates to a decrease in the sale of both our frozen and high pressure guacamole products  which decreased approximately and when compared to the same prior year period 
we currently have two l ultra high pressure machines located in uruapan and estimate we are operating at approximately of the combined machines capacities as of october  we believe the additional capacity provided by the nd machine is reasonable given our current sales projections and expected growth 
net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and we believe that these ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado and other products to our customers 
consequently  we believe that we are positioned to expand our ultra high pressure product line to include more avocado related products  high end salsas  mangoes and other readily available fruit products 
we anticipate a marginal increase in sales related to our processed products 
fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
the increase in net sales is primarily attributable to an increase of million pounds of product sold  or  as well as an increase in the net selling price totaling per product pound sold  or 
during fiscal year  the increase in pounds sold primarily relates to an increase in the sale of both our frozen and high pressure guacamole products  which increased approximately and when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in our net average selling price primarily relates to a change in our product mix 
gross margins the following table summarizes our gross margins and gross profit percentages by business segment change change dollars in thousands gross margins fresh products processed products total gross margins gross profit percentages fresh products processed products consolidated our cost of sales consists predominantly of fruit costs  packing materials  freight and handling  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with preparing food products  and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold 
consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  decreased for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this decrease was principally attributable to decreases in both our fresh and processed product segments for fiscal year consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  remained consistent for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year this consistency was principally attributable to decreased profitability in our processed product segment  substantially offset by an increase in profitability from our fresh products segment 
gross margins and gross profit percentages related to california avocados are largely dependent on production yields achieved at our packinghouses  current market prices of avocados  our packing and marketing fee  and the volume of avocados packed 
our gross margin percentage increased during fiscal year when compared to the same prior year period 
such increase is primarily related to a increase in pounds of avocados sold  an increase in our packing and marketing fee  and a increase in the average sales price of california avocados 
combined  these had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
the decrease in our gross margin percentage related to california avocados during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal  was primarily related to a significant decrease in pounds of fruit sold  as well as an increase in the market price of avocados 
during fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  we experienced a decrease in pounds of avocados sold 
additionally  we also experienced a increase in the average sales price of california avocados 
combined  these had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
the gross margin and gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including chilean avocados  pineapples  and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party  which varies from a fixed rate per box to a percent of the overall selling price 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal years   and  we generated gross margins of million  million  and million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
our business with mexican growers differs in that we operate a packinghouse in mexico and purchase avocados directly from the field 
alternatively  we may also purchase mexican avocados directly from co packers located in mexico as well 
in either case  the gross margin and gross profit percentages generated by our mexican operations are significantly impacted by the volume of avocados handled by our packinghouse and the cost of the fruit 
during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados decreased from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year such decrease was primarily related to a decrease in the volume of mexican avocados sold  as well as higher fruit costs 
collectively  these items negatively affected gross margins 
during fiscal year  our gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados increased from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year such increase was primarily related to a increase in the volume of mexican avocados sold  as well as higher sales prices of mexican fruit 
collectively  these items positively affected gross margins 
gross margins and gross profit percentages for our processed products business are largely dependent on the pricing of our final product and the cost of avocados used in preparing guacamole 
during fiscal year  the processed products gross profit percentages marginally decreased  primarily as a result of higher fruit costs  as well as increased packaging costs  both of which had the effect of increasing our per pound costs 
in addition  there was a marginal decrease in total pounds produced  which had the effect of increasing our per pound costs 
these increases were partially offset  however  by a decrease in the production and sale of less profitable items 
we anticipate that the gross profit percentage for our processed product segment will continue to experience fluctuations during the next fiscal year primarily due to the uncertainty of the cost of fruit that will be used in the production process 
during fiscal year  the processed products gross profit percentages decreased primarily as a result of higher fruit costs  as well as increased packaging costs  both of which had the effect of increasing our per pound costs 
such were partially offset  however  by an increase in total pounds produced  which had the effect of reducing our per pound costs 
selling  general and administrative change change dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative   nm  percentage of net sales nm not meaningful selling  general and administrative expenses include costs of marketing and advertising  sales expenses  and other general and administrative costs 
for fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or when compared to the same period for fiscal this increase was primarily related to higher corporate costs  including  but not limited to  costs related to an increase in salaries and benefits totaling approximately million  an increase in broker sales commissions totaling approximately million  and an increase in repairs and maintenance totaling approximately million 
such higher corporate costs were partially offset  however  by a decrease in bad debt expense totaling approximately million 
for fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses remained substantially consistent when compared to the same period for fiscal this consistency was primarily related to higher corporate costs  including  but not limited to  costs related to an increase bad debt expense totaling approximately million  an increase in legal fees totaling approximately million  and an increase in management bonuses totaling approximately million 
such higher corporate costs were substantially offset  however  by a decrease in auditing sarbanes oxley costs totaling approximately million  and a decrease in stock option expense totaling approximately million 
interest income change change dollars in thousands interest income percentage of net sales interest income was primarily generated from loans to growers and our notes receivable from shareholders
