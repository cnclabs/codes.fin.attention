item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the financial statements 
competition the semiconductor and industrial markets in which we participate are intensely competitive and are characterized by price pressure and rapid technological change 
furthermore  these markets are dominated by a few market leaders 
we are one of a limited number of companies that develop and market yield enhancement solutions 
our primary yield enhancement competitors include agilent s laser interferometer positioning systems division  veeco s metrology division  snu precision  kla tencor  and rank taylor hobson 
the principal factors upon which we compete are performance  flexibility  value  on time delivery  responsive customer service and support  and breadth of product line 
high precision optics manufacturing is dominated by relatively few companies who have both strong engineering depth and metrology capability 
the competition is further segmented by the two groups within the division  optical components and electro optics 
the optical components primary competitors include l tinsley  exotic electro optics and sagem  which are able to provide similar performance levels for both meter class plano optics and airborne reconnaissance windows 
the electro optics group which provides significant value added engineering coupled with metrology based manufacturing and fda regulatory control has various levels of competition from elcan optical technologies  jenoptik and asml 
the principal factors upon which we compete are high precision metrology based manufacturing  value added engineering  regulatory and quality controls and customer service 
research  development and engineering operations we operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological change and engineering innovation 
as such  we dedicate substantial resources to research and development 
at june   we employed individuals  or approximately of our workforce  within our research and development and engineering operations 
our strategy is to form close technical working relationships with customers and oem suppliers in our markets to ensure that our products are commercially relevant 
we also maintain a close working relationship with various research groups and academic institutions in the united states and abroad 
we have been recognized as an innovator in commercializing technology  as evidenced by our numerous achievement awards  including r d awards  photonics spectra circle of excellence awards  and others 
we believe that continued enhancement  development  and commercialization of new and existing products and systems are essential to maintaining and improving our leadership position 
patents and other intellectual property our success and ability to compete depend substantially on our technology 
we have been developing a portfolio of intellectual property for over years  and we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret laws  and license agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights for our products 
since we introduced the first optical interferometer in  we have had united states patents issued  of which approximately are currently active  and approximately foreign patents issued  of which approximately are active 
we have approximately united states and approximately foreign patent applications pending 
in addition  we have a number of registered and unregistered trademarks 
while we rely on patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to protect our technology  we also believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we do not expect expirations in the near future related to our active patents to have a material effect on our business 
backlog and orders backlog at june  was million  a decrease of million as compared with million at june  the fiscal year end backlog consisted of million  or  in the metrology segment and million  or  in the optics segment 
orders for the fiscal year ended june  totaled million and consisted of million  or  in the metrology segment and million  or  in the optics segment 
marketing and sales our sales and marketing strategy is to establish and or solidify strategic relationships with leading oems and end users in targeted sectors within our markets 
the selling process for our products is performed through our worldwide sales organization operating out of regional sales offices in california  china  connecticut  germany  japan  singapore  and taiwan 
supporting this core sales team are business development  marketing  service  and engineering specialists representing our various optics and metrology units in connecticut  arizona  california  florida  canada  and singapore 
product promotion is done through trade shows  printed and e business advertising  and industry technical organizations 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our total sales by region based on shipping destination  including sales delivered through distributors during the past three years fiscal year ended june  americas far east japan pacific rim total far east europe total customer service is an essential part of our business since product up time is critical given its effect on our customers production efficiency 
as of june   our global sales customer support and service organization consisted of people skilled in sales  marketing  optical and electro component repair  software  application and system integration  diagnostics  and problem solving capabilities 
manufacturing  raw materials  and sources of supply our principal manufacturing activities are conducted at our facilities in middlefield  connecticut and tucson  arizona 
we also perform manufacturing activities in our canada  singapore  and china facilities and utilize a third party assembly operation in taiwan for our flat panel display systems 
we maintain an advanced optical components manufacturing facility in middlefield  connecticut  specializing in the fabrication  polishing  and coating of plano  or flat  optics for sales to third parties  as well as the manufacturing of a wide variety of optics that are used in our metrology products 
our manufacturing activities for our metrology products consist primarily of assembling and testing components and sub assemblies supplied by us and third party vendors  and then integrating these components and sub assemblies into our finished products 
our optical assembly manufacturing activities are conducted in our tucson  arizona facility 
we integrate our optics  optics from third party vendors  and mechanical sub systems utilizing our metrology in this facility 
certain components and sub assemblies incorporated into our systems are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
we routinely monitor limited source supply parts  and we endeavor to ensure that adequate inventory is available to maintain manufacturing schedules should the supply of any part be interrupted 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on limited source suppliers  we have not qualified a second source for some of these products and the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources could have a negative impact on our results of operations and damage customer relationships

item a 
risk factors we are subject to numerous known and unknown risks  many of which are described below and elsewhere in this annual report 
any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of  or that we currently deem to be immaterial  could also impact our business and results of operations 
general economic conditions and the related deterioration in the global business environment could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
global consumer confidence has eroded amidst concerns over  among other things  declining asset values  inflation  volatility in energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  rising unemployment  and the stability and solvency of financial institutions  financial markets  businesses and sovereign nations 
these concerns have slowed global economic growth and have resulted in recessions in numerous countries  including many of those in north america  europe and asia  where the company does substantially all of its business 
recent economic conditions had a negative impact on our results of operations during fiscal due to reduced customer demand and we expect this trend to continue for at least the next several fiscal quarters 
as these economic conditions continue to persist  or if they worsen  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders  the insolvency of key suppliers which could result in production delays  the inability of customers to obtain credit  and the insolvency of one or more customers 
any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables  create unabsorbed costs due to lower net sales  and ultimately decrease our net sales and profitability including write downs of assets 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations and may have liabilities arising from environmental matters 
we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing processes 
any failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
we are aware of certain levels of contamination on our property which are below reportable levels 
in addition  we are aware of certain contamination on an adjacent property that we formerly owned 
we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the amount of cost  if any  that we might incur or for which we may potentially be responsible to remediate the situation or for damages which may have resulted or result from the situation 
in addition  environmental regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with such regulations 
we are dependent on the semiconductor industry which  as a whole  is volatile 
our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures and component requirements for manufacturers in the semiconductor industry 
this industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment  including the products manufactured and marketed by us 
for the foreseeable future  our operations will continue to be dependent on the capital expenditures in this industry  which in turn is largely dependent on the market demand in the semiconductor markets 
there is currently a severe downturn in the capital expenditures of these manufacturers and this downturn may continue for an extended period of time 
we have been dependent on sales to one large customer  the loss of this customer or expected near term reduction in orders from this customer has and would materially affect our sales and profitability 
during fiscal   and  sales to canon  our largest customer in those periods  accounted for   and of our net sales  respectively 
we expect that sales to canon will continue to represent a significant  yet declining  percentage of our net sales for the near future 
canon is an original investor in our company  the owner at june  of approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock  and is a distributor of certain of our products in the japanese market 
a reduction or delay in orders from this customer  including reductions or delays due to market  economic  or competitive conditions in the industries in which we or our customer serves  could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations 
our customers  including canon  generally do not enter into long term agreements obligating them to purchase our products 
our substantial international sales are subject to risk 
we sell our products internationally  primarily to customers in japan and throughout the pacific rim 
net sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately   and of our net sales in each of the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively  and are expected to continue to account for a substantial percentage of our net sales 
international sales and foreign operations are subject to inherent risks 
these risks include the economic conditions in these various foreign countries and their trading partners  political instability  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  compliance with foreign laws  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other barriers  difficulties in obtaining export licenses  staffing and managing foreign operations  exposure to currency exchange fluctuations  transportation delays  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our sales and costs are negotiated and paid primarily in us dollars 
however  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive to the extent locally produced alternative products are available 
such conditions could negatively affect international sales of our products and foreign operations  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our sales that are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
for fiscal  approximately of our sales were denominated in foreign currencies 
we hedge certain intercompany transactions by entering into forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
these contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures  generally three to nine months 
generally  any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts are expected to be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
there can be no assurance that risks inherent in international sales and foreign operations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
acquisitions may entail certain operational and financial risks 
our growth strategy includes expanding our products and services  and we may seek acquisitions or make internal investments to strategically expand our business 
we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses  technologies  or products complementary to our business and periodically engage in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including some or all of the following substantial cash expenditures and capital investments  potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization of certain intangible assets  difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of the acquired companies  diverting our management s attention away from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  the inability to manage the growth expected for various acquisitions  potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies in the process of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds  and combining different corporate cultures 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition  including the acquisition of the solvision  inc assets which generated losses in fiscal and  will result in long term benefits to us or that our management will be able to effectively manage the acquired businesses 
we may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or of a line of business to which we devote internal resources and funding 
we have in the past disposed or divested ourselves of several companies or lines of business that previously were acquired by us or in which we internally invested  at a significant net loss to us 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on factors such as budgeting cycles of our customers  the size  timing  and recognition of revenue from significant orders  increased competition  our ability to develop innovative products  the timing of new product releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of our products  changes in our and our competitors pricing policies  changes in operating expenses and personnel changes  the effect of our acquisitions and consequent integration  changes in our business strategy  and general economic factors 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
in future periods  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the economy as a whole or of capital expenditures in the semiconductor and industrial markets 
because all of the components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of spending within these markets  the prevailing economic uncertainty renders estimates of future revenue and expenses even more difficult than usual to make 
our scheduled backlog may not result in future sales 
we schedule the production of our systems based in part upon order backlog 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
there can be no assurance that amounts included in our backlog will ultimately result in future sales 
we have experienced push outs and cancellations in the semiconductor capital equipment and electro optics sectors 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales could adversely affect our results of operations 
our lengthy sales cycle could affect our manufacturing schedule and cause us to incur expenses without realizing sales 
our lengthy and variable qualification and sales cycle makes it difficult to predict the timing of a sale or whether a sale will be made  which may cause us to have excess manufacturing capacity or inventory and negatively affect our operating results 
as is typical in the industry  our customers generally expend significant efforts in evaluating and qualifying our products and manufacturing process 
this evaluation and qualification process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three to six months and sometimes longer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales  marketing  and research and development expenses  expend significant management efforts  increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead time supplies prior to receiving an order 
even after this evaluation process  it is possible that a potential customer will not purchase our products 
in addition  product purchases are frequently subject to unplanned processing and other delays  particularly with respect to larger customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their overall purchasing activity 
if we increase capacity and order supplies in anticipation of an order that does not materialize  our gross margins may be negatively impacted  and we may have to carry or write off excess inventory 
even if we receive an order  the additional manufacturing capacity that we add to service the customer s requirements may be underutilized in a subsequent quarter 
either situation could cause our results of operations to be adversely affected 
our long sales cycles also may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter and make us more susceptible to the effects of general economic downturns 
we face risks associated with manufacturing forecasts 
if we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays  which could cause us to lose orders or customers and result in lower net sales 
we currently use a rolling month forecast based primarily on our anticipated product orders and our product order history to help determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead time required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms  and demand for each component at a given time 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and net sales 
if we overestimate our requirements  we could have excess inventory of parts 
in addition  delays in the manufacturing of our products could cause us to lose orders or customers 
our stock price may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of risks 
we believe that factors such as the announcement of new products or technologies by us or our competitors  market conditions in the semiconductor and industrial markets  and quarterly fluctuations in financial results can be expected to cause the market price of our common stock to vary substantially 
further  our net sales or results of operations in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock would likely decline 
in addition  historically the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the market volatility may adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 
furthermore  our common stock trading price may be more susceptible to market fluctuations due to the relatively small public float and trading volume of our stock and our dependence on a limited number of industries 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we face competition from a number of companies in all our markets  many of which have greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities  and greater financial  technological  and personnel resources 
in addition  we compete with the internal development efforts of our current and prospective customers  some of which may attempt to become vertically integrated 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may necessitate price reductions  which can adversely affect results of operations 
although we believe that we have certain technical and other advantages over some of our competitors  maintaining such advantages will require a continued high level of investment by our company in research and development and sales  marketing  and service 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
in addition  due to historical relationships and possible prior investments by potential customers in competitive product lines  it may be more difficult for us to realize certain of our growth strategies and initiatives 
there can be no assurance that the basis of competition in the industries in which we compete will not shift 
our inability to anticipate and keep pace with rapidly changing technological developments in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards  respond to changes in customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance 
the development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
with continuing advances in technology  potential product advancements require an increasing allocation of resources  including potentially more resources than we then would have available 
we commit significant financial and personnel resources on a continuous basis to redesign and enhance our instruments  systems  and components and upgrade our proprietary software technology incorporated in our products 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our business and impact our relationships with customers 
this could have an impact on customers willingness to share proprietary information about their requirements and participate in collaborative efforts with us 
there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide us with timely access to such information  that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or product and service enhancements on a timely basis  or respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others 
in addition  there can be no assurance the new products and services or product enhancements  if any  which we developed will achieve market acceptance 
we may be unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of proprietary technology 
our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology by third parties or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws of the united states 
we have been experiencing an increased level of sales in china and other foreign countries which historically have created concerns for various companies 
in addition  there remains the possibility that others will reverse engineer our products in order to determine their method of operation and introduce competing products or that others will develop competing technology independently 
any such adverse circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business depends on management and technical personnel who are in great demand 
our success depends in large part upon the continued services of many of our highly skilled personnel involved in management  research  development and engineering  sales and marketing  manufacturing  and support and upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified employees 
our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
competition for these individuals from a variety of employers  including our competitors and companies in computer or technology related industries  at times is intense 
in response to the difficult economic environment  we instituted certain reductions in workforce and furlough programs this past year  which may further make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract and retain additional personnel 
we are exposed to significant delays and additional costs if we do not receive adequate or timely supplies of raw materials and other supplies upon which we depend 
we are dependent on suppliers for raw materials and various electrical  mechanical  and optical supplies 
although we enter  either directly or through our contract manufacturers  into purchase orders with our suppliers based on our forecasts  we do not have any guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers 
moreover  as our demand for supplies increases  we may not be able to obtain these supplies in a timely manner 
if any relationship with a key supplier is terminated or if a supplier fails or is unable to provide reliable services or equipment and we are unable to reach suitable alternative solutions quickly  we may experience significant delays and additional costs in the manufacturing of our products 
if our key suppliers cease manufacturing the supplies we require  if their manufacturing operations are interrupted for any significant amount of time  or if they are unable or unwilling to supply us for any other reason  including capacity constraints  then we may be at least temporarily unable to obtain these supplies  thus exposing us to significant delays and additional costs 
currently there are only a limited number of companies that are capable of supplying optical materials in the quantity and of the quality we require 
we assemble our flat panel display systems in taiwan through a third party 
we are dependent on the third party to assemble the systems accurately and on a timely basis 
to the extent the quality of work  including any individual unit  causes delays or cancellations in shipments to our customers  our results could be adversely affected 
our products may contain defects that are undetected until after our products are installed which may lead to a loss of reputation and customers 
our products are deployed in large and complex systems and may contain defects that are not detected until after our products have been installed  which could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
we design some of our products for deployment in large and complex optical networks 
because of the nature of these products  they can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in networks for long periods of time 
our customers may discover defects in our products only after they have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  our products are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these conditions increase the risk that we could experience  among other things loss of customers  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal actions by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could cause us to experience losses  incur liabilities  and cause our net sales to decline 
our investments in marketable securities may lose their value if economic conditions were to deteriorate 
our marketable securities represent approximately of our total assets at june  to the extent credit markets tighten  interest rates increase  or other economic conditions influence the liquidity of our marketable securities  the value and liquidity of our marketable securities may be adversely affected 
in addition  we may have to record an impairment charge for marketable securities if we determine that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of a marketable security has taken place 
for fiscal  we have recorded an impairment charge for a marketable security of million

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty obligations  self insured healthcare claims  income taxes  and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and current market conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation of marketable securities  share based compensation  warranty costs  self insured health insurance costs  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on our standard products when title passes to the customer upon shipment 
while our standard products generally require installation  the installation is considered a perfunctory performance obligation 
standard products do not have customer acceptance criteria 
generally  software is a component of our standard product and  as such  is not separately recognized as revenue 
we have standard rights of return for defective products that we account for as a warranty provision under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we do not have any price protection agreements or other post shipment obligations 
for custom equipment where customer acceptance is part of the sales agreement  revenue is recognized when the customer has accepted the product 
in cases where custom equipment does not have customer acceptance as part of the sales agreement  we recognize revenue upon shipment as long as the system meets the specifications as agreed upon with the customer 
certain transactions have multiple deliverables  with the deliverables clearly defined 
to the extent that the secondary deliverables are other than perfunctory  we recognize the revenue on each deliverable  if separable  or on the completion of all deliverables  if not separable  all in a manner consistent with sab no 
and eitf standalone software products are recognized as revenue when they are shipped 
revenue generated from development contracts are recorded on a cost plus basis in the period services are rendered 
certain customer transactions include payment terms whereby we receive a partial payment of the total order amount prior to the related sale being recognized in our financial statements 
these advance payments are included in accrued progress payments and deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheet 
generally  these progress payments relate to orders for custom equipment that require a lengthy build cycle and  in some cases  acceptance by the customer 
we may negotiate payment terms with these customers on these particular orders and secure certain payments prior to or on shipment of the equipment 
these payments remain in accrued progress payments and deferred revenue until our applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns  and specific collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit from our customer before a shipment is made 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated future usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
contracts with fixed prices are evaluated to determine if estimated total costs will exceed revenues 
a loss provision is recorded when the judgment is made that actual costs incurred plus estimated costs remaining to be incurred based on management s estimates will exceed total revenues from the contract 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for our products  and technological obsolescence 
management estimates future product sales and service requirements  and evaluates technological changes and other possible uses to determine if inventory is excess or obsolete 
if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments negatively or positively affecting earnings may be required 
other than temporary impairment of marketable securities marketable securities have been primarily classified as held to maturity  which requires them to be carried at amortized cost 
we also have certain securities that are classified as available for sale and trading 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of marketable securities on a quarterly basis 
marketable securities with unrealized depreciation in fair value for twelve or more consecutive months and other securities with unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
investment ratings  company specific events  general economic conditions  and other reasons are evaluated in determining if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the marketable security is valued at the current fair value and an impairment charge is reflected in earnings 
share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  share based payment as amended using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the determination of these assumptions is based on past history and future expectations  and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we consider historical warranty costs actually incurred and specifically identified circumstances to establish the warranty liability 
the warranty liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
should actual costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
a one percent change in actual costs would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an estimated realizable amount based on historical and forecasted results 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in fiscal  management determined that it is more likely than not that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future and an adjustment to record a full valuation allowance was charged to income tax expense 
should management determine that it would be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes to the valuation allowance  changes in pre tax income between jurisdictions that have higher or lower tax rates  changes to federal  state  or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on july  among other tax guidance  fin requires applying a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of tax positions 
as a result of this adoption  we recognized a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits of million  an increase in income tax receivables of million  and a charge of approximately million to the july  retained earnings balance 
as of the adoption date  we had gross tax affected unrecognized tax benefits of million  of which million  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
due to our net operating loss carryforwards  we have accrued no interest and penalties for the unrecognized tax benefits  however  our accounting policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense 
penalties  if incurred  would be recognized as a component of income tax expense 
in the normal course of business  we provide for uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits accordingly 
for the year ended june   we recognized an additional liability of million for uncertain tax positions 
the total liability for uncertain tax liabilities was million at june  we are not aware of any tax positions that would create a significant adjustment to the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal year ended june  valuation of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger the impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an accumulation of costs for an asset in excess of the amount originally expected  a current period operating loss or cash flow decline combined with a history of operating loss or cash flow uses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses  and a current expectation that  it is more likely than not  a long lived asset will be disposed of at a loss before the end of its estimated useful life 
if one or more of such facts or circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if an impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the assets is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets based on a current market value of the assets 
if a current market value is not readily available  a projected discounted cash flow method is applied using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges on property  plant  and equipment  intangible assets  and marketable securities 
health insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance 
we rely on claims experience in determining an adequate liability for claims incurred  but not reported 
to the extent actual claims exceed estimates  we may be required to record additional expense 
a one percent change in actual claims would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview zygo corporation is a worldwide supplier of optical metrology instruments  precision optics  and electro optical design and manufacturing services  serving customers in the semiconductor capital equipment and industrial markets 
optical instruments products encompass non contact optical measurement instruments 
optics products consist of high performance macro optics components  optical coatings  and optical system assemblies 
we conduct the majority of our manufacturing in our  square foot facility in middlefield  connecticut and a  square foot leased facility in tucson  arizona 
the worldwide economic recession has had a severe impact on our orders  sales  and net results 
as a result of the economic downturn  among other things  we have reevaluated our strategic initiatives and our overall business strategy and operations 
we are focusing sales  marketing  and research and development efforts on our core metrology and optics technologies  including the potential for strategic alternatives  which could include partnerships  joint ventures  divestitures  or alliances similar to the agreement described below 
on june   zygo and nanometrics incorporated nanometrics announced that nanometrics has purchased inventory and certain other assets relating to zygo s semiconductor solutions business for approximately million and that the two companies have entered into a supply agreement 
under an exclusive oem supply agreement  zygo will provide interferometer sensors to nanometrics for incorporation into the unifire line of products as well as nanometrics family of automated metrology systems 
nanometrics will assume all inventory  backlog and customer sales and support responsibilities and zygo will provide measurement sensors for integration by nanometrics 
in addition to the applications currently addressed by nanometrics and zygo products  the business partnership allows for the joint development of additional technology solutions targeted at the semiconductor and related industries 
this sale and supply agreement enables us to accomplish our goal of accelerating the commercial deployment and market penetration of our core interferometer technology into the worldwide semiconductor industry without the investment associated with system integration  distribution  applications and support 
in response to the decline in sales and orders  we have taken and continue to take various permanent and temporary actions to mitigate the effects on our company of the downturn in the global economy  including reductions in work force  salary adjustments  unpaid furloughs  suspension of our matching k program  and a reduction in director fees 
these actions are expected to save us in excess of over million on an annualized basis 
we continue to be mindful of our cash position and to investigate strategic alternatives which may be beneficial to our company 
our backlog at june  was million  a decrease of million from june  orders were million in the fourth quarter of fiscal orders for the fourth quarter from the company s metrology segment accounted for of the orders received  with the optics segment accounting for the remaining 
for fiscal  orders were million  a decrease of over fiscal as a result of a decline in orders related to our pps product line  which supplies our lithography customers  we evaluated our assets supporting this product for potential impairment 
we recorded an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal against intangible assets of million and property  plant  and equipment of million 
based on our backlog and order levels  we also evaluated our inventory levels in our various product lines 
we recorded inventory reserves of million against various product lines 
indications received from our customers lead us to believe that our order levels have stabilized 
while this does not mean a rapid upturn in orders is imminent  it does allow us to focus our attention on growth and concentrate our efforts on our core metrology and optics technologies 
we are experiencing a greater than expected order demand in china through our joint venture for our metrology products 
we still expect a continued depression in lithography sales  especially to our largest customer 
on february   we acquired certain assets of solvision  inc solvision  a canadian based company  including the shares of its singapore subsidiary 
in fiscal  the final valuation was completed resulting in a final purchase price of million in cash net of cash received of million 
in addition  the company had also loaned to solvision million of which substantially none of the loan was recouped as part of the purchase price allocation based on asset values 
the solvision acquisition is currently included in our metrology solutions division as the vision systems business unit 
during the third quarter of fiscal we recorded impairment charges against vision systems s intangible assets of million 
on october   we and electro scientific industries  inc esi jointly announced the execution of a definitive agreement  providing for the two companies to merge in an all stock transaction  subject to the prior satisfaction of certain enumerated conditions precedent 
on january   zygo announced that it notified esi of zygo s board of directors withdrawal of its recommendation in favor of the previously announced merger agreement with esi 
a reevaluation of the proposed merger with esi by zygo s board of directors was necessitated by changes in conditions since the merger agreement was executed on october   and the zygo board s view of the impact of these changes on the current and expected performance and operations of zygo and esi 
on april   esi and zygo agreed to terminate their previously executed merger agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  zygo paid esi a break up fee of million  and is liable for an additional million in the event that on or before november   zygo s board of directors approves an alternate transaction proposal for the merger or sale of the company 
during fiscal  we paid an additional million related to the merger in professional fees and various other expenses 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net sales year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total net sales in the metrology segment decreased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in net sales of million within the metrology segment was primarily due to sales volume decreases in lithography of million  instrument sales of million  and semiconductor sales of million  partially offset by an increase in display sales of million and in vision systems sales of million 
the general economic recession has led to low sales volume 
we believe our products are still well accepted in the markets we serve 
the lithography market is expected to continue to be depressed for at least the next six months 
net sales in the optics segment decreased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in net sales of million within the optics segment was due to a decrease in volume of contract manufacturing of million and laser and precision optics of million 
the decrease in all optics areas generally is related to a decline in the orders from existing customers due primarily to the economic recession 
approximately of all fiscal net sales were denominated in us dollars  the same percentage of sales we experienced in fiscal significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the sales of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
gross profit year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the metrology segment decreased fifteen percentage points as compared with the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to intangible and fixed asset impairments of million and inventory reserves of million 
excluding these charges  our gross profit as a percentage of sales for the metrology segment would have been 
the decrease from in fiscal to in fiscal excluding million of referenced charges is due to lower sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the optics segment decreased by fourteen percentage points for fiscal as compared with the prior year 
this decrease included charges of million for fixed asset impairments  restructuring  and severance  which account for percentage points of the change year over year 
the remainder of the change is primarily related to underutilization of the factory based on low sales volume 
optics components rely upon a capital intensive production facility and certain expenditures  such as depreciation  cannot be reduced as readily as a labor intensive environment 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales sg a in fiscal as compared with fiscal increased million primarily due to increases in general and administration costs of million  partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing activities of million 
the increase in general and administrative costs included million in merger related expenses  million in bad debt reserves  in legal accruals  and million in severance 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal also included charges of million in intangible asset impairment charges related to the vision systems business and million in severance 
excluding these charges  sg a costs would have been million for fiscal  a decrease over fiscal the inclusion of vision systems for the entire fiscal year increased sg a by million 
this increase was partially offset by cost cutting measures implemented during fiscal  which decreased salaries and wages by million 
research  development  and engineering expenses rd e year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales the increase in rd e costs in fiscal was primarily related to intangible asset and fixed asset impairment charges of million and million in severance costs during the year 
excluding these charges  rd e for fiscal would have decreased to million 
the decrease in rd e from million in fiscal to million excluding million in referenced charges in fiscal is primarily due to decreases in our stage metrology million and semiconductor million rd e spending 
stage metrology spending was reduced in response to the lack of customer demand related to the slowdown in the semiconductor market and the general economic recession 
semiconductor rd e spending decreased as several large rd e projects related to new product development were completed or are nearing completion 
fiscal spending on these projects was less than in fiscal we expect future rd e spending in the semiconductor unit to be limited to sensor development to support the supply agreement with nanometrics in june income tax benefit expense year ended dollars in millions june  tax rate june  tax rate income tax expense in fiscal included a valuation allowance of million against all net deferred tax assets 
fiscal also does not include any tax benefit associated with the net operating loss for the fiscal year or tax credits earned in the fiscal year 
management believes  based upon the uncertain and volatile market conditions and the fact that the company is now in a cumulative pre tax accounting loss position over a three year period  it is no longer more likely than not that the current net deferred tax assets will be realized 
in future periods  the valuation allowance could be reduced based on sufficient evidence indicating that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
net earnings loss year ended dollars in millions june  sales june  sales net loss in fiscal was million compared with net earnings of million in the prior year 
net loss per diluted share was for fiscal  as compared with net earnings of per diluted share for fiscal the net loss in fiscal included million in significant charges  net of taxes  which included asset impairment charges  write downs and reserves on various other balance sheet items  and a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
these charges were incurred primarily as a result of the economic downturn  recent changes in our business strategy and operations  and the resulting in re evaluation of certain of our assets 
backlog backlog at june  totaled million  a decrease of million from june  the year end fiscal backlog consisted of million  or  in the metrology segment and million  or  in the optics segment 
orders for fiscal totaled million 
orders by segment for fiscal consisted of million  or  in the metrology segment and million  or  in the optics segment 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total net sales in the metrology segment decreased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the decrease in net sales of million within the metrology segment was primarily due to volume decreases in lithography sales of million  display sales of million  and semiconductor sales of million  partially offset by an increase in instrument sales of million and vision systems sales from the solvision acquisition of million 
the increase in instrument sales was primarily due to a million increase in sales in our europe region based on volume 
net sales in the optics segment increased in fiscal as compared with the prior year 
the increase in net sales of million within the optics segment was primarily due to an increased volume of laser and precision optics of million  offset by a decrease in contract manufacturing sales  which includes medical components  of million 
approximately of all fiscal net sales were denominated in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can influence the sales of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
gross profit year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales segment metrology optics total in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the metrology segment increased one percentage point as compared with the prior year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales in the optics segment decreased by four percentage points for fiscal as compared with the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to shipments in the first half of fiscal for the initial production run of the helmet mounted display units that resulted in zero margin due to cost over runs on the initial units 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales sg a in fiscal as compared with fiscal increased million primarily due to increases in selling and marketing activities of million  partially offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses of million 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses included an additional million in commission expense  primarily related to instrument sales in europe  an increase of million related to the planned increased presence in asia  a million increase in semiconductor sales and marketing efforts  an million increase in optics division sales and marketing efforts  and the incurrence of million in expenses for vision systems for the four month period 
the decrease in general and administrative costs was primarily related to a reduction in employee costs of million  including management bonus and employee profit sharing expense  offset by an increase for vision systems of million for the first four months of operation  and of million related to share based compensation expense 
research  development  and engineering expenses rd e year ended dollars in millions june  net sales june  net sales the increase in rd e costs in fiscal was primarily related to increased spending on semiconductor initiatives of million  display solutions of million  and vision systems of million  and within the optics division of million 
these rd e cost increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in our precision positioning systems and instruments business 
we continue to focus and build on our semiconductor initiatives as one of our core areas of expected future growth 
income tax expense year ended dollars in millions june  tax rate june  tax rate the overall tax rate increased by one percentage point when compared with the prior year primarily due to the repeal of the deduction attributable to the extraterritorial income exclusion on december  net earnings year ended dollars in millions june  sales june  sales net earnings in fiscal decreased by as compared with the prior year 
net earnings per diluted share were for fiscal  as compared with per diluted share for fiscal the decreased earnings were primarily the result of decreased net sales in precision positioning systems  display solutions  and semiconductor solutions and increased sg a and r d expenses due to additional spending within instruments  the semiconductor initiatives and the inclusion of solvision operating expenses  which are reflected in our results for the last four months of the fiscal year 
transactions with stockholder sales to canon  a stockholder  customer  and distributor of certain of our products in japan amounted to million of net sales  million of net sales  and million of net sales  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
selling prices of products sold to canon are based  generally  on the normal terms customarily given to distributors 
revenues generated in fiscal and prior from a development contract with canon were recorded on a cost plus basis 
at june  and  there was in the aggregate  million and million  respectively  of trade accounts receivable from canon 
in september  we entered into a contract with canon related to the development of certain interferometers 
in march  we signed a preliminary agreement to begin further add on work  the definitive agreement for this additional work was signed in december in february  we entered into two additional agreements with canon related to the development of prototype production tools and accessories 
during the twelve months ended june   we recognized revenue of million under the canon development services contract 
our development services contract with canon was completed during the third quarter of fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   cash and marketable securities was million  a decrease of million from million at june  the decrease in cash was primarily attributable to merger related costs of million which includes a merger termination fee of million and  among other factors  million of severance costs 
cash flows used for operating activities were million for fiscal as compared with cash flows provided by operating activities of million in fiscal operating cash flows in fiscal were impacted primarily by the net loss offset by a decrease in receivables and inventory 
cash flows provided by investing activities for fiscal were million as compared with million in fiscal purchases and proceeds of marketable securities activities were million and million  respectively  in fiscal and million and million  respectively  in fiscal in fiscal  we decreased our capital spending by million 
in fiscal  we acquired certain assets of solvision  including the shares of its singapore subsidiary  for million in cash net of cash received 
cash flows used for financing activities for fiscal were million as compared with million in fiscal in august  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to million 
we repurchased million of stock in fiscal there were no repurchases in fiscal the composition of our marketable securities by industry sector is as follows finance  utilities  real estate  and other 
we hold five corporate bonds at june   with the largest individual bond having a value at maturity of million 
we have the ability and intent to hold all the securities to maturity  the last maturity of which is on december  we believe there are no impairments in our investments other than an impairment of million on an auction rate security recorded during fiscal such auction rate security is valued at at june  although cash requirements will fluctuate during the fiscal year  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
we have no line of credit or readily available borrowing capacity 
there is no assurance that we would be able to secure financing if the need arose 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years operating leases total does not include sublease income of aproximately million per year through at june   we also have a liability for uncertain tax benefits of million  which was recorded in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the timing of the settlement of such liability cannot presently be determined 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt  or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any obligations of a third party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  changes in the investment grade of marketable securities  and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities including institutional money market funds which may include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  and us treasury securities  and corporate bonds 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly on our short term instruments 
the table below presents investment amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio 
fair value of investments as of june  maturing in dollars in millions thereafter cash equivalents fixed rate investments weighted average interest rate marketable securities fixed rate investments weighted average interest rate on june   the company had variable interest rate money market accounts valued at million 
marketable securities fair market value sensitivity at june   our investment portfolio included an auction rate security of million  which is believed to have risk exposure in sub prime markets 
we have reviewed  along with our investment advisor  current investment ratings  company specific events  and general economic conditions in determining whether there is a significant decline in fair value that is other than temporary 
we have concluded that there is an other than temporary decline in fair value and have recorded an impairment charge on the full value of the security 
exchange rate sensitivity approximately of our fiscal net sales were denominated in us dollars 
at june   our backlog included orders in us dollars of million  or of the total backlog 
substantially all of our costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact sales of our products in export markets as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our sales that are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
we enter into forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
these forward contracts are entered into for periods consistent with the currency transaction exposures  generally three to nine months 
any gains and losses on the fair value of these contracts would largely offset corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions and foreign operations are denominated in the euro and japanese yen 
in the absence of a substantial increase in sales orders in currencies other than us dollars  we believe a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and yen would have an immaterial impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
