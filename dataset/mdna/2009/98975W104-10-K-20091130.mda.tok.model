md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this overview summarizes the md a  which includes the following sections our business a general description of the key drivers that affect our business  the industry in which we operate and the strategic initiatives on which we focus 
results of operations an analysis of our overall results of operations and segment results for the three years presented in our financial statements 
we operate in two segments carbon fiber and technical fiber 
other miscellaneous and corporate are combined into a third business segment called headquarters other 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  sources and uses of cash  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  the potential impact of currency exchange and an overview of our financial position 
critical accounting estimates a description of accounting estimates that require critical judgments and estimates 
our business executive overview we are an applied technology and advanced materials company 
we are a leader in the commercialization of carbon fiber through our development of a price competitive  high performance reinforcement for composites used in a broad range of commercial products which we sell under the panex trade name 
in addition to manufacturing carbon fiber  we produce an intermediate product that we refer to as technical fiber  a stabilized and oxidized acrylic fiber used in flame and heat resistant applications which we sell under the pyron trade name 
we have spent over years developing our proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we believe that we are the largest capacity manufacturer primarily focused on producing low cost carbon fiber for commercial applications 
key performance indicators our management monitors and analyzes several key performance indicators within each of these segments to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance  including revenue 
in the short term  management closely reviews the volume of product shipments and indicated customer requirements in order to forecast revenue and cash receipts 
in the longer term  management believes that revenue growth through new product applications is the best indicator of whether we are achieving our objective of commercializing carbon fiber 
we expect that new applications  including those we are attempting to facilitate  will continue to positively affect demand for our products 
the following factors have affected the net sales of our carbon fiber segment in recent years the growth in emerging applications using carbon fiber  such as wind turbines  increases in our manufacturing capacity  foreign currency fluctuations  selling prices  and global economic and capital market conditions affecting our customers 
we expect that our net sales in future periods will continue to be affected by all of these factors 
during fiscal  we implemented selected price decreases primarily as a result of decreases in raw material costs 
we periodically change our prices based on changes in our costs  as well as to reflect overall market conditions 
the net sales of our technical fiber segment have been affected in the past  and we expect will continue to be affected in the foreseeable future  by the demand and order patterns resulting from aircraft brake manufacturers 
gross profit 
our total gross profit for fiscal   and was   and  respectively 
management focuses on maintaining and improving the gross profit over the long term while leading the commercialization of carbon fiber and controlling associated costs 
as such  the company has maintained available unused capacity to remain poised to capture opportunities in emerging markets 
gross margin was negatively impacted by by available unused capacity costs of million in fiscal the primary cost components of our carbon fiber and technical fiber segments are energy and acrylonitrile  which is a propylene based product and our primary raw material for the production of acrylic fiber precursor used in our carbon fiber and technical fiber production 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are driven by headcount and related administrative costs  marketing costs  and research and development costs 
we monitor headcount levels in specific geographic and operational areas 
we believe that research and development expenditures will be the primary means by which we can facilitate new product applications 
cash flow from operating activities 
cash flow from operating activities for fiscal   and was million  million  and million 
management believes that operating cash flow is meaningful to investors because it provides a view of zoltek with respect to ongoing operating results 
liquidity and cash flows 
due to the variability in revenue  our cash position varies 
we closely monitor our expected cash levels  particularly as it relates to operating cash flow  days sales outstanding  days payables outstanding and inventory turnover 
management also monitors debt levels and the financing costs associated with debt 
we expect to repay all our outstanding long term debt during fiscal and to continue to finance our working capital needs with bank lines of credit 

table of contents business trends at the end of fiscal  we completed our expansion plans and essentially doubled our production capacity over the immediately preceding two fiscal years 
our capacity increase was completed just as world trade dropped and the global economy began to experience deep recession 
during fiscal  we have seen a sudden  but we believe only temporary  slowdown in the growth of wind turbine business 
this occurred at the same time as a significant decrease in the aerospace market due unexpected delays in the introduction of new jetliners utilizing aerospace carbon fibers 
inasmuch as producers of carbon fibers for commercial and aerospace applications had greatly increased their installed capacity over the past few years  we have seen intensified competition between aerospace and commercial carbon fiber manufacturers in cross over applications eg  sporting goods for which either aerospace or commercial carbon fibers may be utilized 
in this business environment  management continued to focus its efforts on building on the long term vision of zoltek as the leader in commercialization of carbon fibers as a low cost but high performance reinforcement for composites 
management primarily emphasized the following areas increased sales efforts in selected international markets 
we have identified international markets with high growth potential for our existing and emerging commercial applications 
accordingly  we have added sales personnel and increased our marketing efforts in india  china and korea  which have shown growth for wind energy and other applications 
business development in emerging applications 
we have identified emerging applications for our products with high growth potential across a variety of industries and regions 
in addition to producing carbon fibers for the existing prepreg technology used by many of our large wind turbine customers  we have recently begun shipments of carbon fibers qualified for use in the infusion process utilized by other wind turbine blade manufacturers 
we also are seeking to qualify our products for use in aerospace secondary structures such as floor  luggage bins and seats  and anticipate increased sales in this market as the production of new jetliners increases 
additionally  we are gearing up for the anticipated next phase of wider use of carbon fibers in automotive applications 
operating cash flows and cash management 
despite a decrease in sales  we had positive operating cash flows of million in fiscal  compared to million during fiscal increased inventory levels used million in fiscal the company seeks to reduce inventory levels going forward 
in order to accomplish this goal the company is focused on increasing sales and reducing production levels to better match current sales rates 
during fiscal  we established collection targets and payment schedules for all customers and suppliers to improve better control our days sales outstanding and days payables outstanding 
the company paid down million of its convertible debt and million of capital expenditures and construction payables related primarily to the expansion of precursor and carbon fiber lines in mexico 
even with these cash outlays which are not expected to recur in fiscal  the company s cash balance only declined by million

under certain circumstances  the company may settle the principal and accrued unpaid interest in common stock 
additionally  the may  july and october issuances allow the company to require conversion if the price of the company s common stock stays above per share for a period of consecutive days beginning six months after the date of registration of the resale of the underlying shares 
at that time  the company may require the investor to convert with at least days notice 
the may  july and october issuances also provide stipulation that the investor may require the company to pay out the quarterly installment due in cash if the company s common stock volume weighted average price average is below on the date of conversion

amortization of financing fees and debt discount at the time of issuance of convertible debt securities with warrants  the company records the fair value associated with the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
this fair value discount is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the convertible debt security that is accreted to its face value over the life of the convertible security and expensed into the company s income statement 
if the convertible security is converted prior to the redemption date  the unamortized debt discount associated with the valuation of the warrants is recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital at the time of conversion 

table of contents the february  february  may  july and october issuances were considered to have a beneficial conversion feature because the adjusted conversion price after allocating a portion of the proceeds to the warrants  as discussed above  was less than the company s market price of common stock at date of issue 
the beneficial conversion is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the convertible debt security and is accreted to its face value over the life of the convertible security and expensed into the company s income statement 
if the convertible security is converted prior to the redemption date  the unamortized balance is recorded in expense at the time of conversion

accounts receivable collectibility the company evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable for each of our segments based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filing or substantial downgrading of credit  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against the amounts due reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount we estimate will be collected 
for all other customers  we estimate reserves for bad debts based on the length of time receivables have been past due and our experience with collection 
our bad debt expense on accounts receivables was million for  million for and million for inventories the company evaluates its ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of future demand  if any  are reserved 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost includes material  labor and overhead 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company s projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales on the company s statement of operations in the period in which the revision is made 
the company historically has not experienced material problems related to the pricing or functionality of carbon fibers inventory 
our panex carbon fibers represent the majority of our inventory balance and are available in continuous tow  fabric  prepreg  chopped  and milled forms 
generally  technical obsolescence and spoilage have not historically been a concern because nonqualifying produced items can be reclaimed for processing for sale in secondary markets 

table of contents available unused capacity costs for fiscal are comprised of fixed production cost allocated to manufacturing lines which were producing below normal levels during the year 
the company reviews monthly production levels of all manufacturing lines for all products 
any lines which produced at a rate below a historical range of normal capacity were identified and the fixed costs associated with those lines were calculated 
the unallocated costs were recognized as an expense in the period in which they were incurred 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
zoltek management is responsible for routinely assessing whether impairment indicators are present 
the company expects that the components of each operating segment will exhibit similar financial performance over the long term and  therefore  groups assets accordingly for analyzing whether an impairment exists 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset group  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
in determining expected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the group of long lived assets  the company must make certain judgments and estimations including the expected market conditions and demand for products produced by the assets  expected product pricing assumptions  and assumptions related to the expected costs to operate the assets 
it is possible that actual future cash flows related to the company s long lived assets may materially differ from the company s determination of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  if the company s expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company s carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge 
contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to employment  environmental  service providers  supply agreements  taxing authorities and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required  if any  for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
we accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events  and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances  differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages  and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
income taxes the company accounts for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against certain deferred tax assets when realization of those assets are not considered to be more likely than not 
we are subject to the jurisdiction of numerous tax authorities 
our operations in these different jurisdictions are generally taxed on income before taxes adjusted for various differences between tax law and gaap accounting 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
our tax filings for various periods are subject to audit by the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
stock based compensation on october   the company adopted the provisions of fasb asc formerly referenced as fas r share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
fasb asc requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon the grant date fair value of those awards 
under the modified prospective method of adopting fasb asc the company recognized compensation cost for all share based payments granted after october   plus any awards granted to employees prior to october  that remain unvested at that time 
under this method of adoption  no restatement of prior periods was made 
the company uses historical volatility for a period of time that is comparable to the expected life of the option 
however  the company only calculates the volatility of the company s stock back to november  the date the company received its first large order for carbon fiber  as that is when the company considers its business to have changed from a research and development company to an operational company 
management believes this is a better measurement of the company s stock volatility

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities under its credit facility and other variable rate debt 
assuming the current level of borrowings of million at variable rates and a two percentage point change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated our interest expense for the twelve months ended september  would have changed by approximately million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  we would seek to take actions to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk 
further  no consideration has been given to the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of the company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
the company does not believe such risk is material because a significant amount of the company s current debt is at fixed rates 
at september   the company did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
foreign currency risk the consolidated balance sheet of the company s international subsidiaries  zoltek zrt 
and zoltek de mexico  were translated from hungarian forints and mexican pesos to us dollars  respectively  at the exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date  while its consolidated statements of operations were translated using the average exchange rates in effect for the periods presented 
the related translation adjustments are reported as other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions of zoltek zrt 
are included in the results of operations in other expenses 
the company views as long term its investments in zoltek zrt 
and zoltek de mexico 
zoltek zrt 
has a functional currency of the huf 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign currency risks related to this investment 
the functional currency of zoltek de mexico has changed as of november  from the mexican peso to the us dollar 
the company does not currently employ a foreign currency hedging strategy related to the sales from hungary or mexico 
neither hungary nor mexico is considered to be a highly inflationary or deflationary economy 
as of september   the company had a long term loan to its zoltek zrt 
subsidiary of million denominated in us dollars 
the potential loss in value of the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek zrt 
resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the hungarian forint against the us dollar at september  and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the company does not expect repayment of the loan in the foreseeable future 
as such  the company considers this loan as a permanent investment 
in addition  zoltek zrt 
routinely sells its products to customers located primarily throughout europe in sales transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the hungarian forint 
also  zoltek zrt 
has debt that is denominated in foreign currencies other than the hungarian forint 
as of september   the company had a long term loan to its zoltek de mexico subsidiary 
there is no potential loss in value of the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek de mexico million resulting from an adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the mexican peso against the us dollar at september  because zoltek de mexico s functional currency is the us dollar 
the company does not expect repayment of the loan in the foreseeable future 
as such  the company considers this loan as a permanent investment
