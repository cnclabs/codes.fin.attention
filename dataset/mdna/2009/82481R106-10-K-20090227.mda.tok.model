results from the phase trial support the previously reported interim findings that plicera was generally safe and well tolerated at all doses and increased target enzyme activity levels in a majority of patients 
shire has rights to plicera in markets outside the us 
amigal hgt for the treatment fabry disease amigal is an orally administered  small molecule pharmacological chaperone being developed for the treatment of fabry disease 
amigal has received orphan drug designation by the emea  which may provide it with up to ten years market exclusivity in the eu 
amicus met with the fda to discuss the amigal development program in june  and discussions are ongoing 
discussions are also ongoing with the emea 
a final decision on the global development strategy will follow the conclusion of the discussions with both agencies 
shire has rights to amigal in markets outside the us 
hgt for the treatment of pompe disease hgt is an orally administered  small molecule pharmacological chaperone being developed for the treatment of pompe disease 
pompe disease  also known as glycogen storage disease type ii or acid maltase deficiency  is a relatively rare neuromuscular and lysosomal storage disorder caused by inherited genetic mutations in a key enzyme called acid glucosidase gaa which result in deficient activity of the enzyme gaa 
the deficient activity of the gaa enzyme  which normally breaks down glycogen  results in lysosomal glycogen accumulation in skeletal  cardiac and smooth muscle tissue 
in june amicus initiated a phase clinical trial of hgt  an orally administered  small molecule pharmacological chaperone being jointly developed for the treatment of pompe disease by shire and amicus 
this trial was placed on clinical hold in february in response to reports of two adverse events probably related to treatment with hgt shire has rights to hgt in markets outside the us 
early research products a number of additional projects are underway in the early stages of development for the hgt business area 
manufacturing and distribution manufacturing the company sources its products from third party contract manufacturers  and for certain products has its own manufacturing capability 
all products marketed by the international sales and marketing operation are either manufactured and supplied by the licensor of the product under supply arrangements or are manufactured for shire by third parties under contract 
the company currently has dual sources for vyvanse  adderall xr  fosrenol  elaprase and replagal and is developing a second source of manufacture for lialda 
the company sources firazyr  daytrana  carbatrol  pentasa and xagrid from a single contract manufacturer 
the company manages the risks associated with reliance on single sources of production by carrying additional inventories or developing second sources of supply 
active pharmaceutical ingredient api sourcing the company sources api from third party suppliers for its specialty pharmaceuticals products and the hgt product firazyr 
shire has manufacturing capability for agalsidase alfa and idursulfase at its protein manufacturing plant in cambridge  massachusetts  us for its hgt products  replagal and elaprase 
the company currently has a dual source of api for vyvanse  daytrana  adderall xr  pentasa and is developing one for lialda 
the company manages the risks associated with reliance on single sources of api by carrying additional inventories or developing second sources of supply 
a second source of supply of idursulfase for elaprase is being developed 
in order to support the rapid growth of elaprase  additional manufacturing capacity is currently being added in lexington  massachusetts  us 
manufacturing will start in the first quarter of  with submission to regulatory authorities expected in the fourth quarter of shire s supply is sufficient to support all existing patients and allow for forecasted growth in inventory will be managed in order to meet forecasted demand 
distribution the company s us distribution center  which includes a large vault to house us drug enforcement agency dea regulated schedule ii products  is located in kentucky 
from there  the company primarily distributes its specialty pharmaceuticals products through the three major wholesalers who have a hub or distribution centers that stock schedule ii drugs in the us  providing access to nearly all pharmacies in the us 
the distribution and warehousing of hgt products for the us market are contracted out to specialist third party contractors 
outside the us  where the company has local operations  physical distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt products is contracted out to third parties 
outside the us  where the company does not have local operations  distribution agreements are in place for certain territories in respect of both certain specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt products 
material customers the company s two largest trade customers are cardinal health inc and mckesson corp  both of which are in the us 
in  these wholesale customers accounted for approximately and of product sales  respectively 
intellectual property an important part of the company s business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents and trademarks  to the extent available 
the company also relies on trade secrets  unpatented know how  technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain and enhance its competitive position where it is unable to obtain patent protection or where marketed products are not covered by specific patents 
the company s commercial success will depend  in part  upon its ability to obtain and enforce strong patents  to maintain trade secret protection  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to comply with the terms of licenses granted to it 
the company s policy is to seek patent protection for proprietary technology whenever possible in the us  canada  major european countries and japan 
where practicable  the company seeks patent protection in other countries on a selective basis 
in all cases the company endeavors to either obtain patent protection itself or support patent applications by its licensors 
in the regular course of business  the company s patents may be challenged by third parties 
the company is a party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights 
details of ongoing litigation are provided in item legal proceedings 
the degree of patent protection afforded to pharmaceutical inventions around the world is uncertain 
if patents are granted to other parties that contain claims having a scope that is interpreted by the relevant authorities to cover any of the company s products or technologies  there can be no guarantee that the company will be able to obtain licenses to such patents or make other arrangements at reasonable cost  if at all 
the existence  scope and duration of patent protection varies among the company s products and among the different countries where the company s products may be sold 
it may also change over the course of time as patents are granted or expire  or become extended  modified or revoked 
the following non exhaustive list sets forth details of the granted us and eu patents pertaining to the company s key marketed products  material products from which the company receives a royalty and major products in later stages of development  or technology relating to those products  which are owned by or licensed to the company and that are material to an understanding of the company s business taken as a whole 
the company also holds patents in other jurisdictions  such as canada and japan and has patent applications pending in such jurisdictions  as well as in the us and the eu

the loss of patent protection following a legal challenge may result in third parties commencing commercial sales of their own versions of the company s products before the expiry of the patents 
the company s sales of such product s may decrease in consequence 
in many cases  however  the company s products have more than one patent pertaining to them 
in such cases  or where the company enjoys trade secrets  manufacturing expertise  patient preference or regulatory exclusivity  the company may continue to market its own products without its commercial sales of those products being adversely affected by the loss of any given patent 
competition shire believes that competition in its markets is based on  among other things  product safety  efficacy  convenience of dosing  reliability  availability and price 
companies with more resources and larger r d expenditures than shire have a greater ability to fund the research and clinical trials necessary for regulatory applications  and consequently may have a better chance of obtaining approval of drugs that would then compete with shire s products 
other products now in use or being developed by others may be more effective or have fewer side effects than the company s current or future products

adhd market competition in the us adhd market has increased as several products that compete with the company s products have been launched in recent years 
the company has also introduced two new entrants to the market vyvanse  the company s stimulant pro drug product  launched in and daytrana  the company s methylphenidate transdermal product  launched in additional competition will result in from the anticipated launch of generic adderall xr beginning in april  and other adhd products could face generic competition in the future 
many of the competing products contain methylphenidate 
in  johnson johnson in conjunction with alza launched concerta  a once daily formulation of methylphenidate 
for the month of december  concerta had a share of the us adhd market

gi ulcerative colitis market ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease 
the primary treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis are asa containing formulations 
more than of all ulcerative colitis patients receive treatment with asa 
competition in the oral asa market has remained relatively constant with the company s lialda mezavant being the only new branded market entrant for patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis since the launch of the mesalamine pro drug colazal in shire defines the asa competitive set as the non sulfasalazine  oral mesalamine and mesalamine pro drug products 
the us oral asa market is led by proctor and gamble s asacol 
in december  asacol had a share of the oral asa market  declining from in december of in december salix s colazal had a market share  while ucb s dipentum had a market share 
the eu oral asa market is somewhat more fragmented 
major competitors in the uk include proctor and gamble s asacol which had a share of the uk oral asa market and ferring s pentasa tablets had an market share in november the german oral asa market is led by dr falk s salofalk  with market share  followed by merkle s claversal with share in november claversal and pentasa are the leaders in the oral asa market in spain with and market shares respectively in november pentasa sachets are the market leader in france with market share of the oral asa market 
norgine s fiv asa had a share of the french oral asa market 
overall  proctor and gamble s asacol had a share of the eu g oral asa market 
mesalamine and balsalazide products are generally protected by formulation patents only 
in december  the fda denied salix s citizen petition for colazal and salix subsequently announced the launch of an authorized generic version by watson laboratories 
this was followed by the introduction of three other generic versions of colazal 
the company is aware of other asa formulation development efforts by salix and proctor and gamble and other non asa biologic treatments in development for inflammatory bowel disease by ucb and abbott 
market for the treatment of rare genetic diseases the company believes that the primary competition with respect to its products for rare genetic diseases is from smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
competitors for lysosomal storage disorders include biomarin pharmaceutical inc biomarin  actelion ltd 
actelion  and genzyme 
specifically  replagal competes with genzyme s fabrazyme  and  if approved  velaglucerase alfa would compete with genzyme s cerezyme 
shire does not know of any party developing an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of hunter syndrome 
firazyr competes in certain european countries with csl behring s berinert p  a human plasma derived c esterase inhibitor c inh product  csl behring is in the process of seeking regulatory approval for berinert p in additional european countries 
other competitive products in development for hae include dyax corporation s dx  a plasma kallikrein inhibitor  and pharming group s rhucin  a recombinant version of c inh 
the markets for some of the potential products for rare genetic diseases caused by protein deficiencies are quite small  and consequently the company has sought orphan drug designation for certain of such products 
replagal and fabrazyme were granted co exclusive orphan drug status in the eu for up to ten years 
genzyme has orphan drug exclusivity for fabrazyme in the united states until april elaprase has orphan drug designation in the united states and the eu 
firazyr has orphan exclusivity in the eu until for more information on orphan drug designation  see part i item business government regulation 
hiv market the hiv competitive landscape is becoming more crowded and complicated as treatment trends evolve 
nucleoside nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors tc epivir is part of the nucleoside nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors nrti market 
trizivir  combivir and epzicom kivexa are part of the combined nrti market 
truvada tenofovir emtricitabine  sold by gilead  is the market leader combination nrti 
truvada and viread tenofovir  also sold by gilead  both represent the most direct competition to lamivudine 
other hiv competition in addition to the two nrti hiv markets in which lamivudine operates  there is competition from nnrtis 
of the branded nnrtis available  sustiva efavirenz sold by bms and viramune nevirapine sold by boehringer ingelheim are the class leaders 
intelence etravirine was launched by tibotec in the us in january protease inhibitors pis 
of the branded pis available  reyataz atazanavir  sold by bms  and kaletra iopinavir ritanaovir  sold by abbott  dominate this class 
prezista darunavir  sold by tibotec  was initially approved by the fda in june and had its label extended in october entry inhibitors and others 
of the branded drugs available  atripla efavirenz emtricitabine tenofovir  a cross class fixed dose combination sold by gilead and bms  is the market leader in this class 
fuzeon enfuvirtide  an injectable integrase inhibitor sold by roche trimeris  is the other current significant product in this class 
isentress raltegravir was launched by merck in the us in october generic hiv competitors bms s videx ec didanosine became the first generic hiv product in the united states in gsk s retrovir azt came off patent in the us in september and in europe in march several zidovudine generics have been approved by the fda starting in september a generic tenofovir nrti competitor by matrix labs received tentative approval by the fda in november furthermore in generic drug companies have filed andas seeking approval for epivir  combivir  zeffix and epzicom in the us see further information within royalties received from other products above 
several tentative approvals of generic lamivudine have been issued by the fda 
government regulation the clinical development  manufacturing and marketing of shire s products are subject to governmental regulation in the us  the eu and other territories 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the prescription drug marketing act and the public health service act in the us  and numerous directives and guidelines in the eu  govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion and pricing of the company s products 
product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks take a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
in general  for a new chemical entity  the product needs to undergo rigorous preclinical testing 
clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap 
in phase  the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical compound into healthy human volunteers  the emphasis is on testing for safety adverse effects  dosage tolerance  metabolism  distribution  excretion and clinical pharmacology 
phase involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the pharmaceutical compound for specific targeted indications  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks 
once a compound is found to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase evaluations  phase trials are undertaken with a larger number of patients to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficiency and safety of the product and to evaluate more fully clinical outcomes 
the failure to demonstrate adequately the quality  safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development can delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product 
in order to gain marketing approval the company must submit to the relevant regulatory authority for review information on the quality chemistry  manufacturing and pharmaceutical aspects of the product as well as the non clinical and clinical data 
the fda undertakes the review for the us 
in the eu the review may be undertaken by the following i members of the emea s committee for medicinal products for human use chmp as part of a centralized procedure  ii an individual country s agency  followed by mutual recognition of this review by a number of other countries agencies  depending on the process applicable to the drug in question  or iii a competent member state s authorities through a decentralized procedure  an alternative authorization procedure to the mutual recognition procedure for those drugs that are ineligible for a centralized review 
approval can take from several months to several years  or be denied 
the approval process can be affected by a number of factors for example additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review and may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs 
as a condition of approval  the regulatory agency will require post marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects  and may require other additional studies as deemed appropriate 
after approval for the initial indication  further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications 
the terms of any approval  including labeling content  may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product 
as a condition of approval  the regulatory agency will require that the product continue to meet regulatory requirements as to safety  efficacy and quality and will require strict procedures to monitor and report any adverse effects 
where adverse effects occur or may occur  the regulatory agency may require additional studies or changes to prescribing advice or to product licences 
additional data may result in a product authorization being withdrawn at any stage 
some jurisdictions  including the eu and the us  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
generally  if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity means that applications to market the same drug for the same indication may not be approved  except in limited circumstances  for a period of up to ten years in the eu and for up to seven years in the us 
these laws are particularly pertinent to shire s hgt business unit 
in the us  the drug price competition and patent restoration term act of  known as the us hatch waxman act  established a period of marketing exclusivity for brand name drugs as well as abbreviated application procedures for generic versions of those drugs 
approval to manufacture these drugs is sought by filing an anda 
as a substitute for conducting full scale pre clinical and clinical studies  the fda can accept data establishing that the drug formulation  which is the subject of an abbreviated application  is bio equivalent and has the same therapeutic effect as the previously approved drug  among other requirements 
eu legislation also contains data exclusivity provisions 
all products will be subject to an exclusivity regime 
a generic company may file a marketing authorization application for that product with the health authorities eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product 
the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either ten or eleven years have elapsed from the date of grant of the initial marketing authorization 
the one year extension is available if the innovator obtains an additional indication during the first eight years of the marketing authorization that is of significant advancement in clinical benefit 
in the us  the dea also regulates the national production and distribution in the us of scheduled drugs ie those drugs containing controlled substances by allocating production quotas based  in part  upon the dea s view of national demand 
as schedule ii drugs  the production and distribution of shire s adhd products are strictly controlled 
the branch of the fda responsible for drug marketing oversight routinely reviews company marketing practices and also may impose pre clearance requirements on materials intended for use in marketing of approved products 
shire is also subject to various us federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
similar review and regulation of advertising and marketing practices exists in the other geographic areas where the company operates 
regulatory developments in the us various legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems 
some states have passed such legislation  and further federal and state proposals are possible 
such proposals and legislation include  and future proposals could include  price controls  patient access constraints to medicines and increases in required rebates or discounts 
similar issues exist in the eu 
the company cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives  but will work to maintain patient access to its products and to oppose price constraints 
additionally  legislation is being debated at the federal level in the us that could allow patient access to drugs approved in other countries most notably canada 
this is generally referred to as drug re importation 
although there is substantial opposition to this potential legislation within areas of the federal government  including the fda  the company cannot predict the outcome of such legislative activities pertaining to drug re importation 
additionally  us federal and state proposals have called for substantial changes in the medicaid program 
us law requires the company to give rebates to state medicaid agencies based on each state s reimbursement of pharmaceutical products under the medicaid program 
rebates potentially could be viewed as price discounts without appreciable increases in shire s product sales volume as an offset 
the company must also give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of pharmaceutical products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
in september  the food and drug administration amendments act of was signed into law 
it contains a wide range of changes affecting the pharmaceutical industry covering issues relating to fees associated with application approval  drug safety and risk management  direct to consumer advertising  clinical trial and clinical trial result disclosure 
implementing regulations and guidance will be forthcoming from the fda and other agencies  and the company is monitoring the situation closely to assure that it meets the new requirements 
similar regulatory and legislative issues are encountered in europe and other international markets where governments regulate pharmaceutical prices and patient reimbursement levels 
the differing approach to price regulation has led to some parallel trade within the eu where shire s products are imported into markets with higher prices from markets with lower prices 
exploitation of price differences between countries in this way can impact sales in those markets with higher prices 
third party reimbursement and pricing the company s revenue depends  in part  upon the price third parties  such as health care providers and governmental organizations are willing to reimburse patients and physicians for the cost of the company s products or the company s competitors similar products and related treatment 
these third party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of pharmaceutical products and or seeking pharmaco economic data to justify their negotiated reimbursement prices 
in the us  several factors outside shire s control could significantly influence the sale price of pharmaceutical products  including medicare part d prescription drug plans  new medicare part b reimbursement rules  the increase in states seeking supplemental medicaid rebates  the ongoing trend toward managed healthcare  and the renewed focus on reducing costs and reimbursement rates in medicaid  medicare and other government insurance programs 
for example  revisions or clarification from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms related to medicaid and other government reimbursement programs may have retroactive application which may result in changes to management s estimated rebate liability reported in a prior period 
at the time of sale  revenues from the company s products are reasonably estimable with the aid of historical trend analysis and consideration of any current period changes in pricing practices 
the rebates can be reasonably determinable at the time of sale to the initial customers 
these factors would not impact our revenue recognition policy under generally accepted accounting principles 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of established a voluntary drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries and created the new medicare part d and medicare part b 
medicare part d gives elderly and disabled people  already on medicare  access to subsidized prescription drug coverage from january onwards 
medicare part b establishes new rules to lower medicare s reimbursement rate for physician administered drugs 
it is difficult to predict the long term impact of this expansion of medicare on pharmaceutical companies 
usage of pharmaceutical products may increase as the result of expanded access to medications afforded by partial reimbursement under medicare 
however  such potential sales increases may be offset by increased pricing pressures due to enhanced purchasing power of the private sector that will negotiate on behalf of medicare beneficiaries 
similar developments may take place in the eu markets  where the emphasis will likely be on price controls and non reimbursement for new and highly priced medicines for which the economic as well as the therapeutic rationales are not established 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products in the eu 
limits on reimbursement available from third party payers may reduce the demand for the company s products 
price applications in europe have delayed product launches of products otherwise approved in some countries for up to two years and  in occasional situations  prevented launch 
as a consequence the company s estimated dates for product launches may be subject to change 
corporate responsibility cr the company continues to develop its approach to cr  the shire cr committee guides the overall direction and sets and monitors objectives 
members of the committee include representatives from  among others  r d  hr  environment health safety  compliance risk management  facilities  marketing and corporate communications

item a risk factors the company has adopted a risk management strategy designed to identify  assess and manage the significant risks that it faces 
while the company aims to identify and manage such risks  no risk management strategy can provide absolute assurance against loss 
set out below are the key risk factors  associated with the business  that have been identified through the company s approach to risk management 
some of these risk factors are specific to the company  and others are more generally applicable to the pharmaceutical industry in which the company operates 
the company considers that these risk factors apply equally and therefore all should be carefully considered before any investment is made in shire 
risk factors related to the company s business the company s new products may not be a commercial success shire has launched a number of new products in the last four years  including key new products elaprase  vyvanse  lialda  firazyr and fosrenol row 
the commercial success of these new products  as well as other new products that the company may launch in the future  will depend on their approval and acceptance by physicians  patients and other key decision makers  as well as the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals  the scope of marketing approvals as reflected in the product s label  the countries in which such approvals are obtained  the authorization of price and reimbursement in those countries where price and reimbursement is negotiated  and safety  efficacy  convenience and cost effectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products 
the company may not be able to grow revenues in its new products as quickly as anticipated if any or all of the following occur if competitive products are genericised and the impact on the market negatively affects the prescribing of branded treatments for the indications that the company s new products treat  if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with the company s new products not seen in clinical trials that impact the physician s willingness to prescribe the company s new products  if issues arise from clinical trials being conducted for post marketing purposes or for registration in another country or regulatory agencies in one country act in a way that causes concern for prescribers or patients in another country  if patients  payors or physicians favor older treatments over newer treatments  if government regulation is stricter for the company s new products than for existing treatments  if the new products suffer a loss of patent protection or competitors successfully challenge or circumvent the company s patents or regulatory exclusivity see item legal proceedings of this form k for details of current patent litigation  if planned geographical expansion into emerging markets is not successful  or if the size of the patient population for the new product is less than expected or the company fails to identify new patients for the new products 
if the company is unable to commercialize elaprase  vyvanse  lialda  firazyr  fosrenol row or any of its new products successfully  there may be a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
any decrease in the combined sales of vyvanse and adderall xr will significantly reduce revenues and earnings in  the combined sales of vyvanse and adderall xr were  million  representing approximately of the company s total revenues 
sales of adderall xr are expected to decrease significantly due to generic competition that is anticipated to commence on april  any factors that decrease the sales of adderall xr more significantly than expected could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the entrance of generic competitors for adderall xr or other leading adhd medications could impact the sales of vyvanse 
other factors that could impact the sales of vyvanse or adderall xr include  but are not limited to faster than anticipated erosion of adderall xr sales by generic competitors  the development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals to vyvanse and adderall xr  issues impacting the production of vyvanse or adderall xr or the supply of amphetamine salts including  but not limited to  the ability to get sufficient quota from the dea  technological advances including the approval of new competing products for adhd treatments  changes in reimbursement policies of third party payers  government action intervention  marketing or pricing actions by competitors  public opinion towards adhd treatments  any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention  product liability claims  and changes in prescription writing practices 
any decrease in the sales of tc could significantly reduce earnings the company receives royalties from gsk on the worldwide sales of tc 
in  the company s royalty income relating to tc sales was million million  million 
this royalty stream generates a larger proportion of net income relative to the company s own product sales as there are minimal costs associated with its generation 
any factors that decrease sales of tc by gsk could significantly reduce the company s earnings 
these include development and marketing of competitive pharmaceuticals  including generic versions  loss of patent protection or ability of competitors to challenge or circumvent patents see item legal proceedings of this form k for details of current patent litigation  reduction in the production of tc  technological advances  government action intervention  marketing or pricing actions by gsk s competitors  any change in the label or other such regulatory intervention  public opinion towards aids treatments  and product liability claims 
the failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement  or an adequate level of reimbursement  by third party payers in a timely manner for certain of the company s products and parallel importation may impact future revenues and earnings the company s revenues are partly dependent on the level of reimbursement provided to the company by governmental reimbursement schemes for pharmaceutical products 
changes to governmental policy or practices could adversely affect the company s sales  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the cost of treatment established by health care providers  private health insurers and other organizations  such as health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations are under downward pressure and this  in turn  could impact on the prices at which the company can sell its products 
the market for pharmaceutical products could be significantly influenced by the following  which could result in lower prices for the company s products and or a reduced demand for the company s products the ongoing trend toward managed health care  particularly in the us  legislative proposals to reform health care and government insurance programs in many of the company s markets  and price controls and non reimbursement of new and highly priced medicines for which the economic and therapeutic rationales are not established 
the prices for certain of the company s products when commercialized  in particular products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases such as replagal and elaprase  may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products 
the company may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for its products  including those that are likely to have a high annual cost of therapy 
the failure to obtain and maintain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for such products may adversely affect revenues and earnings 
parallel importation occurs when an importer finds a cheaper price for a product or equivalent product on the world market and imports that product from the lower price jurisdiction to the higher price jurisdiction 
if the parallel importation of lower priced drugs is permitted in the us  it could have the effect of reducing sales of equivalent drugs in the us 
to the extent that parallel importation increases  the company may receive less revenue and earnings from its commercialized products 
the parallel importation of prescription drugs is relatively common within the eu 
a disruption to the product supply chain may result in the company being unable to continue marketing or developing a product or may result in the company being unable to do so on a commercially viable basis the company sources its products from third party contract manufacturers  and for certain products has its own manufacturing capability 
in the event of either the company s failure or the failure of any third party contract manufacturer to comply with mandatory manufacturing standards often referred to as current good manufacturing standards or cgmp in the countries in which the company intends to sell or have its products sold  the company may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products 
the company dual sources certain key products and or active ingredients 
however  the company currently relies on a single source for production of the final drug product for each of daytrana  firazyr  lialda  pentasa  reminyl and xagrid and relies on a single active ingredient source for each of elaprase  firazyr  fosrenol  reminyl  replagal and xagrid 
in the event of financial failure of a third party contract manufacturer  the company may experience a delay in supply or be unable to market or develop its products 
this could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that suppliers will continue to supply on commercially viable terms  or be able to supply components that meet regulatory requirements 
the company is also subject to the risk that suppliers will not be able to meet the quantities needed to meet market requirements the development and approval of the company s products depends on the ability to procure active ingredients and special packaging materials from sources approved by regulatory authorities 
as the marketing approval process requires manufacturers to specify their own proposed suppliers of active ingredients and special packaging materials in their applications  regulatory approval of a new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the supplier specified in the marketing approval 
the need to qualify a new supplier could delay the company s development and commercialization efforts 
the company uses bovine derived serum sourced from new zealand and north america in the manufacturing processes for replagal and elaprase 
the discovery of additional cattle in north america or the discovery of cattle in new zealand with bovine spongiform encephalopathy  or mad cow disease  could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on these products  or prohibit the company from using these products at all in such countries 
the actions of certain customers can affect the company s ability to sell or market products profitably  as well as impact net sales and growth comparisons a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the us and european markets 
in  for example  approximately of the company s product sales were attributable to two customers  mckesson corp 
and cardinal health  inc in the event of financial failure of any of these customers  the company may suffer financial loss and a decline in revenues and earnings 
in addition  the number of independent drug stores and small chains has decreased as retail pharmacy consolidation has occurred 
consolidation or financial difficulties could cause customers to reduce their inventory levels  or otherwise reduce purchases of the company s products 
such actions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s specialty pharmaceuticals product sales are made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors as well as to large pharmacies in both the us and europe 
consequently  product sales and growth comparisons may be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of major distributors and other trade buyers 
these fluctuations may result from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions  or other factors 
in addition  a significant portion of the company s revenues for certain products for treatment of rare genetic diseases are concentrated with a small number of customers 
changes in the buying patterns of those customers may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the outsourcing of services can create a significant dependency on third parties  the failure of whom can affect the ability to operate the company s business and to develop and market products the company has entered into many agreements with third parties for the provision of services to enable it to operate its business 
if the third party can no longer provide the service on the agreed basis  the company may not be able to continue the development or commercialization of its products as planned or on a commercial basis 
additionally  it may not be able to establish or maintain good relationships with the suppliers 
the company has also entered into licensing and co development agreements with a number of parties 
there is a risk that  upon expiration or termination of a third party agreement  the company may not be able to renew or extend the agreement with the third party as commercial interests may no longer coincide 
in such circumstances  the company may be unable to continue to develop or market its products as planned and could be required to abandon or divest a product line 
in the event of breakdown  failure or breach of security on any of the company s it systems  the company may be unable to maintain its business operations the company operates several complex information systems upon which it is dependent 
the company has back up procedures and disaster recovery plans in place to enable the business to continue its normal operations and to mitigate any loss in the event of a failure 
however  in the event of breakdown  failure or breach of security of any of these systems or the associated suppliers  the company may be unable to maintain its business operations 
this could lead to loss of revenue and delay in product development 
in addition  the company is in the process of installing enterprise wide information systems in its operations throughout the world 
any failure in the operation of these systems could have an adverse effect on the company s business operations 
the company may incur unexpected expenditure in order to comply with us environmental laws the company s manufacturing sites are situated in the us and are subject to national  state and local environmental laws 
compliance with environmental laws requires ongoing expenditure and any spillage or contamination found to be caused by the company may result in clean up costs and financial penalties for the company which could adversely affect the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
contracts are used in all areas of operation of the business 
they may contain provisions that do not protect the company s position or with which it cannot comply contracts form the basis of agreement in many key activities such as mergers and acquisitions  arrangements with suppliers  outsourcing  product licensing and marketing 
these contracts may contain provisions that impose duties on the parties involved or may fail to contain adequate conditions to protect the company s position 
the company may be unable to meet its obligations under a contract or may be unable to require other parties to comply with their obligations and  therefore  may suffer financial loss or penalty 
risk factors related to the pharmaceutical industry in general the actions of governments  industry regulators and the economic environments in which the company operates may adversely affect its ability to develop and market its products profitably changes to laws or regulations impacting the pharmaceutical industry  in any country in which the company conducts its business  may adversely impact the company s sales  financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  changes to the regulations relating to orphan drug status may affect the exclusivity granted to products with such designation 
changes in the general economic conditions in any of the company s major markets may also affect the company s sales  financial condition and results of operations 
the introduction of new products by competitors may impact future revenues the manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals is highly competitive 
many of the company s competitors are large  well known pharmaceutical  biotechnology  chemical and healthcare companies with considerable resources 
companies with more resources and larger r d expenditures have a greater ability to fund clinical trials and other development work necessary for regulatory applications 
they may also be more successful than the company in acquiring or licensing new products for development and commercialization 
if any product that competes with one of the company s principal drugs is approved  the company s sales of that drug could fall 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also characterized by continuous product development and technological change 
the company s products could  therefore  be rendered obsolete or uneconomic  through the development of new products  technological advances in manufacturing or production by its competitors 
if the company s projects or clinical trials for the development of products are unsuccessful  its products will not receive authorization for manufacture and sale due to the complexity of the formulation and development of pharmaceuticals  the company cannot be certain that it or its collaborative partners will successfully complete the development of new products  or  if successful  that such products will be commercially viable 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of each product under development  the company or its collaborative partners must demonstrate through clinical and other studies that the product is of appropriate quality and is safe and effective for the claimed use 
clinical trials of any product under development may not demonstrate the quality  safety and efficacy required to result in an approvable or a marketable product 
failure to demonstrate adequately the quality  safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product 
in addition  regulatory authorities in europe  the us  canada and other countries may require additional studies  which could result in a increased costs and significant development delays  or b termination of a project if it would no longer be economically viable 
the completion rate of clinical trials is dependent upon  among other factors  obtaining adequate clinical supplies and recruiting patients 
delays in patient enrolment in clinical trials may also result in increased costs and program delays 
additional delays can occur in instances in which the company shares control over the planning and execution of product development with collaborative partners 
the company cannot be certain that  if clinical trials are completed  either the company or its collaborative partners will file for  or receive  required authorizations to manufacture and or market potential products including a marketing authorization application or anda or that such application will be reviewed and approved by the regulatory authorities in a timely manner  if at all 
if the company is unable to meet the requirements of regulators in relation to a particular product  it may be unable to develop the product or obtain or retain the necessary marketing approvals drug companies are required to obtain regulatory approval before manufacturing and marketing most drug products 
regulatory approval is generally based on the results of quality testing chemistry  manufacturing and controls  non clinical testing  and clinical testing 
the clinical development  manufacture  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive regulation  including separate regulation by each member state of the eu  the emea itself and federal  state and local regulation in the us 
unanticipated legislative and other regulatory actions and developments concerning various aspects of the company s operations and products may restrict its ability to sell one or more of its products or to sell those products at a profit 
the generation of data is regulated and any generated data is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
required regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner  if at all 
in addition  other regulatory requirements for any such proposed products may not be met 
even if the company obtains regulatory approvals  the terms of any product approval  including labeling  may be more restrictive than desired and could affect the marketability of its products 
regulatory authorities also have the power amongst other things  to revoke or suspend approvals of previously approved products  require the recall of products that fail to meet regulatory requirements  and close manufacturing plants that do not operate in conformity with cgmp and or other regulatory requirements or approvals 
such delays or actions could affect the company s ability to manufacture and sell its products 
the failure of a strategic partner to develop and commercialize products could result in delays in approval or loss of revenue the company enters into strategic partnerships with other companies in areas such as product development and sales and marketing 
in these partnerships  the company is dependent on its partner to deliver results 
while these partnerships are supported by contracts  the company does not exercise direct control 
if a partner fails to perform or experiences financial difficulties  the company may suffer a delay in the development  a delay in the approval or a reduction in sales or royalties of a product 
the failure to secure new products or compounds for development  either through in licensing  acquisition or internal research and development efforts  may have an adverse impact on the company s future results the company s future results will depend  to a significant extent  upon its ability to in license  acquire or develop new products or compounds 
the company also expends significant resources on research and development 
the failure to in license or acquire new products or compounds  on a commercially viable basis  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
the failure of these efforts to result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may fail to obtain  maintain  enforce or defend the intellectual property rights required to conduct its business the company s success depends upon its ability and the ability of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual property rights 
where possible  the company s strategy is to register intellectual property rights  such as patents and trademarks 
the company also relies variously on trade secrets  unpatented know how and technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain its competitive position 
patents and patent applications covering a number of the technologies and processes owned or licensed to the company have been granted  or are pending in various countries  including the us  canada  major european countries and japan 
the company intends to enforce vigorously its patent rights and believes that its partners intend to enforce vigorously patent rights they have licensed to the company 
however  patent rights may not prevent other entities from developing  using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to the company s products or technologies or processes for formulating or manufacturing similar or functionally equivalent products 
the company s patent rights may be successfully challenged in the future or laws providing such rights may be changed or withdrawn 
the company cannot assure investors that its patents and patent applications or those of its third party manufacturers will provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to protect the company s products and technology or that such patents will not be challenged  revoked  invalidated  infringed or circumvented by third parties 
in the regular course of business  the company is party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights 
see item of this form k for details of current patent litigation 
additionally  the company s products  or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture those products may now  or in the future  infringe the patent rights of third parties 
it is also possible that third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development  manufacture or sale of the company s products 
if third parties are the first to invent a particular product or technology  it is possible that those parties will obtain patent rights that will be sufficiently broad to prevent the company or its strategic partners from developing  manufacturing or selling its products 
the company may need to obtain licenses for intellectual property rights from others to develop  manufacture and market commercially viable products and may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  any licensed patents or proprietary rights may not be valid and enforceable 
the company also relies on trade secrets and other un patented proprietary information  which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees  consultants  advisors and partners 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information 
if the company s employees  scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the company s products under development  such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the company s property  but may remain the property of those persons or their employers 
protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of the company s proprietary rights 
the failure to obtain or maintain patent and trade secret protection  for any reason  could allow other companies to make competing products and reduce the company s product sales 
the company has filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with its products in various countries including the us and countries in europe and latin america and intends to trademark new product names as new products are developed 
in addition  with respect to certain products  the company relies on the trademarks of third parties 
these trademarks may not afford adequate protection or the company or the third parties may not have the financial resources to enforce any rights under any of these trademarks 
the company s inability or the inability of these third parties to protect their trademarks because of successful third party claims to those trademarks could allow others to use the company s trademarks and dilute their value 
if a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes adverse side effects  this could result in damage to the company s reputation  the withdrawal of the product and legal action against the company unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of the company s products  or those of its competitors  could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or successfully market its products 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sales of pharmaceutical products entails a risk of product liability claims  product recalls  litigation and associated adverse publicity 
the cost of defending against such claims is expensive even when the claims are not merited 
a successful product liability claim against the company could require the company to pay a substantial monetary award 
if  in the absence of adequate insurance coverage  the company does not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy a liability resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defense of such a claim  it could become insolvent 
product liability insurance coverage is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms 
although the company carries product liability insurance  this coverage may not be adequate 
in addition  it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for present or future products will be available 
moreover  an adverse judgment in a product liability suit  even if insured or eventually overturned on appeal  could generate substantial negative publicity about the company s products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other products 
investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies relating to the company s activities in the highly regulated markets in which it operates may result in the distraction of senior management  significant legal costs and the payment of substantial compensation or fines the company engages in various marketing  promotional and educational activities pertaining to  as well as the sale of  pharmaceutical products in a number of jurisdictions around the world 
the promotion  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and the operations of market participants  such as the company  are closely supervised by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies  including the fda  the us department of justice and the dea in the us 
any inquiries or investigations into the operations of  or enforcement or other regulatory action against  the company by such regulatory authorities could result in the distraction of senior management for prolonged periods of time  significant defense costs and substantial monetary penalties 
loss of highly qualified management and scientific personnel could cause the company subsequent financial loss the company faces intense competition for highly qualified management and scientific personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
it may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel 
the company has agreements with a number of its key scientific and management personnel for periods of one year or less 
the loss of such personnel  or the inability to attract and retain the additional  highly skilled employees required for its activities could have an adverse effect on the company s business

it is intended that the first interim payment each year should be constant in us dollar terms 
dividend growth for the full year will be reviewed by the board when the second interim dividend is determined 
any dividend growth will come through increasing the second interim dividend in a financial year 
income access share ias trust arrangements shire has put into place income access share arrangements which enable shire ordinary shareholders  other than shire ads holders  to elect to receive their dividends from a company resident for tax purposes in the republic of ireland or receive their dividends under the income access share arrangements from a shire group company resident for tax purposes in the uk 
old shire has issued one income access share which is held by the income access share trustee pursuant to the ias trust 
the ias trust is constituted pursuant to a trust deed which provides that i the income access share trustee will hold any dividends paid not just declared on the income access share on trust for the shire ordinary shareholders who have elected or are deemed to have elected to receive dividends pursuant to these arrangements  ii the income access share itself will be held on trust for shire  and iii each registered holder of shire ordinary shares on a dividend record date who has made or is deemed to have made a valid income access share election described below will be entitled to receive from the income access share trustee an amount equal to the dividend it would have received from shire  to the extent the income access share trustee has actually received an amount equal to such amount by way of dividend from old shire 
to ensure compliance with technical trust law rules  the period during which the income access share trust may continue will be restricted 
however  the income access share trust should be able to continue for years 
this mechanism is reflected in the articles of association of both shire plc and old shire  the mechanics of the arrangements are as follows the shire plc articles of association provide that if i a dividend is announced or declared by shire plc on the shire ordinary shares  ii an amount is paid by old shire by way of a dividend on the income access share to the income access share trustee  and iii such amount is paid by the income access share trustee to the shire ordinary shareholders who have elected or are deemed to have elected to receive dividends under these arrangements  the dividend which would otherwise be payable by shire to such shire ordinary shareholders will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid to such shire ordinary shareholders by the income access share trustee 
if the dividend paid on the income access share and on paid by the income access share trustee to the shire ordinary shareholders is less than the total amount of the dividend announced or declared by shire on the shire ordinary shares in respect of which an election has been made or is deemed to have been made to receive dividends under these arrangements  shire will be obliged to pay a dividend on the shire ordinary shares to those shire ordinary shareholders who have so elected or are deemed to have so elected of the amount of the shortfall 
in such a case  any dividend paid on the shire ordinary shares will generally be subject to irish withholding tax at the rate of or such lower rate as may be applicable under exemptions from withholding tax contained in irish law 
a shire ordinary shareholder is entitled to make an income access share election such that he will receive his dividends which would otherwise be payable by shire under these arrangements from old shire 
a shire ordinary shareholder who held  or fewer shire ordinary shares at the time he became a shire ordinary shareholder pursuant to the court sanctioned scheme of arrangement  and who did not make a contrary election  is deemed to have made an election pursuant to the shire articles of association such that he will receive his dividends under these arrangements from old shire 
equally  where a shire ordinary shareholder who first acquires his shire ordinary shares after the date of the scheme of arrangement  who holds  or fewer shire ordinary shares on the first dividend record date after he becomes a shire ordinary shareholder  and who does not make a contrary election  will be deemed to have made an election pursuant to the shire articles of association such that he will receive his dividends under these arrangements from old shire 
in accordance with the provisions of the shire ads deposit agreement  the depositary has made an election on behalf of all holders of shire adss such that they will receive dividends from old shire under the income access share arrangements 
dividends paid by old shire under the income access share arrangements will not under current legislation be subject to any uk or irish withholding taxes 
if a holder of shire adss does not wish to receive dividends from old shire under the income access share arrangements  he must withdraw his shire ordinary shares from the shire ads program prior to the dividend record date set by the depositary and request delivery of the shire ordinary shares 
this will enable him to receive dividends from shire if necessary  by making an election to that effect 
it is the expectation  although there can be no certainty  that dividends will be paid by old shire through the income access share trustee to shire ordinary shareholders who make or are deemed to make an income access share election 
it is the expectation  although there can be no certainty  that old shire will distribute dividends on the income access share to the income access share trustee for the benefit of all shire ordinary shareholders who make or are deemed to make an income access share election in an amount equal to what would have been such shire ordinary shareholders entitlement to dividends from shire in the absence of the income access share election 
to the extent that any dividend paid on the income access share to the income access share trustee and on paid by the income access share trustee to the shire ordinary shareholders is less than an amount equal to what would have been such shire ordinary shareholders entitlement to dividends from shire in the absence of the income access share election  the dividend on the income access share received by the income access share trustee will be allocated pro rata to such shire ordinary shareholders and shire will pay the balance by way of dividend 
in such circumstances  there will be no grossing up by shire in respect of  and old shire and shire will not compensate those shire ordinary shareholders for  any adverse consequences including any irish withholding tax consequences 
shire will be able to suspend or terminate these arrangements at any time  in which case the full shire dividend will be paid directly by shire to those shire ordinary shareholders including the depositary who have made or are deemed to have made an income access share election 
in such circumstances  there will be no grossing up by shire in respect of  and old shire and shire will not compensate those shire ordinary shareholders for  any adverse consequences including any irish withholding tax consequences 
on october  old shire paid dividends totaling million on the income access share to the income access share trustee in an amount equal to the dividend shire ordinary shareholders would have received from shire 
reduction of capital and distributable reserves on june  the jersey court approved a reduction of shire plc s then known as shire limited share capital to take effect on june  the reduction increased the distributable reserves potentially available to shire plc at the time of reduction to approximately billion by recharacterizing amounts standing to the credit of shire plc s share premium account as a distributable reserve 
the purpose of the reduction of capital is to create a distributable reserve which would be available to be distributed as dividends  at the discretion of the directors of shire plc  from time to time or for any other lawful purpose to which such a reserve may be applied including share buy backs 
the reduction of capital was designed to create in shire plc a level of distributable reserves similar to that previously available in old shire and to enable shire plc to continue shire s existing dividend policy in a financially and operationally efficient manner 
since shire plc is a jersey company  the payment of dividends by shire plc is governed by jersey law 
under jersey law  shire plc is entitled to make payments of dividends from its accumulated profits and other distributable reserves 
prior to making any dividend payment  the directors of shire plc who authorize the payment of the dividend must make a solvency statement to the effect that shire plc will be able to continue to carry on its business and discharge its debts as they fall due immediately after the payment is made and for the twelve month period following the making of the payment 
shire plc s future dividend policy will be dependent upon the amount of its distributable reserves  its financial condition  the terms of its then existing debt facilities and other relevant factors existing at the time 
for dividends paid by old shire prior to the scheme  and for those dividends paid by old shire on the income access share to the income access share trustee subsequent to the scheme  the ability of old shire to pay dividends is determined under english law 
as a matter of english law old shire can only pay dividends out of its distributable profits  which are the accumulated realized profits under generally accepted accounting principles in the united kingdom  including reserves arising from a reduction of share capital  of old shire and not the consolidated group  so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization  less accumulated realized losses  so far as not previously written off in a reduction of capital duly made

overview shire s strategic goal is to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician 
shire focuses its business on adhd  hgt and gi diseases as well as opportunities in other therapeutic areas to the extent they arise through acquisitions 
shire s in licensing  merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property protection and global rights 
shire believes that a carefully selected and balanced portfolio of products with strategically aligned and relatively small scale sales forces will deliver strong results 
substantially all of the company s revenues  expenditures and net assets are attributable to the r d  manufacture  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two operating segments specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt 
the company also earns royalties where shire has out licensed products to third parties which are recorded as revenues within all other in the segmental analysis 
revenues are derived primarily from two sources sales of the company s own products and royalties of total revenues are derived from product sales  of which are within the specialty pharmaceuticals operating segment and are within the hgt operating segment  of total revenues are derived from royalties 
shire s strategic objectives are set using a balanced scorecard approach 
objectives are also set at the business  functional and therapeutic area levels and are aligned with the company wide strategic and operational objectives 
the company therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management 
key performance indicators kpis are used to measure achievement of the objectives 
strategic objectives are categorized into fields financial  customers  people capabilities and operational excellence 
for  shire s corporate objectives included target net revenue and defined levels of revenue growth  target sales and contributions for core products  development of a strategy to improve customer care and customer service levels  drug application filing and launch targets for new products  development of a strategy to achieve the optimum shire product portfolio  development of optimal manufacturing and supply chain strategy  development and communication of career development tools for employees  development and commencement of rollout of corporate brand positioning  and maintenance of robust risk management practices including internal controls 
the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the health care industry is experiencing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs  increased r d costs as development programs are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators  challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers  low cost generic drugs entering the market on expiration of patent protection  and higher marketing costs due to the use of direct to consumer campaigns in the us and competition for market share 
shire s strategy to become the leading specialty biopharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry wide competitive pressures 
this strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas markets historically  shire s portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the north american market 
with the acquisition of tkt in and the establishment of our hgt business  shire has substantially increased its presence in europe and thereby diversified the risk associated with being reliant on one geographic market 
through the tkt acquisition  shire acquired elaprase global rights and replagal which is presently sold only outside the us and through the jerini acquisition  firazyr global rights 
in addition  saw the european launch of firazyr and the continued roll out of mezavant and fosrenol in europe 
for  sales outside north america represented approximately of product sales 
shire s late stage development pipeline contains a number of products with rights outside of the us  including vyvanse  daytrana  velaglucerase alfa ga gcb  spd  plicera  amigal  at and metazym 
shire s continued expansion beyond north america will be driven by the development of products with patent protection in both the north and latin american and european markets wherever possible 
in and  subject to obtaining the relevant regulatory governmental approvals  regions outside the us should see the continued roll out of mezavant in certain european union eu countries  the launch of daytrana eu and canada  the continued roll out of firazyr in certain european and latin american countries  the launch of vyvanse in canada  and the launch of velaglucerase alfa in the eu 
this program of new product launches will require significant investment in advertising  promotional spend and in some cases  additional sales representatives 
the orphan disease nature of hgt products means that relatively low associated sg a and sales infrastructure investment is required  making them ideal products for shire to launch into new markets 
in markets outside north america and europe where products require significant sg a and infrastructure investment  shire will assess opportunities for internal investment versus distribution and or out license partners on a country by country basis 
r d over the last five years shire has focused its r d efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas  which meet the needs of the specialist physician 
the company has also concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval for later stage pipeline products within its core therapeutic areas 
evidence of the successful execution of this strategy can be seen from the progression of the company s development pipeline over the last five years 
since january  nine products have received regulatory approval  six in the us fosrenol and equetro in  daytrana and elaprase in  lialda and vyvanse in and three in europe fosrenol in  elaprase and mezavant in 
the company has another one product in registration in the us intuniv and one in registration in the eu daytrana 
shire s strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile 
r d costs in will include expenditure on several pre clinical to phase and phase b and phase studies to support recently launched products in the specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt businesses  and the development of new projects in both the specialty pharmaceuticals and hgt businesses 
for a full discussion of these projects see item business 
patents and market exclusivity the loss or expiration of patent protection or market exclusivity with respect to any of the company s major products could have a material adverse effect on future revenues and net income as generic manufacturers may produce similar drugs and be able to sell the company s drugs at a lower price as their costs of development are significantly lower than shire s 
the company anticipates that there will be one or more generic competitors to adderall xr in the adhd market beginning april adderall xr is  in revenue terms  shire s most significant product representing of total revenues in 
the company expects that sales of vyvanse will partially offset any decline in sales of adderall xr and that vyvanse prescriptions will come from a number of sources  including patients who are new to adhd treatment  patients who previously were taking adderall xr  and patients who were taking another adhd medication 
shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its adderall xr and carbatrol patents  as well as the patents for certain other products 
these legal proceedings are discussed in more detail in item legal proceedings 
business development as a result of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or market exclusivity  shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long term patent protection and market exclusivity 
the company remains active in seeking out opportunities to acquire new products or companies that fit its business strategy  its existing therapeutic areas or are in complementary therapeutic areas 
during shire acquired more than of jerini  adding jerini s hae product  firazyr  to the portfolio  and acquired the global rights to metazym  a clinical candidate arylsulfatase a  from zymenex 
in  the company acquired new river  allowing shire to capture the full economic value of vyvanse and gain control of the development and commercialization of this product 
in shire also in licensed the rights to amigal  plicera and at  three pharmacological chaperone compounds for lysosomal storage disorders in markets outside the us  spd for celiac disease in markets outside the us and japan  and worldwide rights excluding eu member states to juvista 
as part of its strategy of focusing on drugs with long term patent protection in its core therapeutic areas  the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to dispose of non core assets 
in the company divested a portfolio of non core products  including solaraze and vaniqa  to almirall and sold equetro and transferred post approval study commitments to validus pharmaceuticals inc organization and structure during  the company undertook a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement  establishing shire plc as the new shire holding company 
for further details on the scheme of arrangement see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in part iv to this annual report

the decline in the market value of the company s investment in renovo group plc initially arose from the results of clinical trials for juvista announced over and during the third quarter of  in considering whether the decline in value was temporary or other than temporary under us gaap the company considered the following factors the severity of the decline from historical cost and its duration eleven months  market analysts targets of renovo group plc s share price for the next months  and the revised expected filing date for juvista due to the adoption of a sequential rather than parallel phase development plan 
these factors  together with the significant decline in global equity markets during the third quarter of meant that the company was unable to reasonably estimate the period over which a full recovery in the value of its investment in renovo group plc could occur

foreign currency fluctuations a number of the company s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  the consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly those between the us dollar  canadian dollar  pounds sterling and the euro 
the accumulated foreign currency translation differences at december  of million are reported within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet and foreign exchange gains for the year to december  of million are reported in the consolidated statement of operations 
at december   the company had outstanding swap and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the currency risk associated with inter company transactions 
for further information  see item a to this annual report 
at december  the fair value of these contracts was a liability of million 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments  trade accounts receivable from product sales and from third parties for which the company receives royalties and derivative contracts 
excess cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including money market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits 
the money market and liquidity funds in which shire invests are all triple a rated by both standard and poor s and by moody s credit rating agencies and the us onshore funds participate in the us treasury department s temporary guarantee program 
the company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative instruments 
the company limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which require counterparties to have a long term credit rating of a a or better from the major rating agencies 
the internal credit limits are approved by the board and exposure against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury function 
the counterparties to the derivative are major international financial institutions 
the company s revenues from product sales are mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical wholesalers and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy chains 
for the year to december  there were two customers in the us who accounted for of the company s total revenues 
however  such clients typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered minimal 
the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap and sec regulations  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to the valuation of intangible assets  the valuation of equity investments  sales deductions  income taxes and provisions for litigation 
i valuation of intangible assets a general the company has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets  recorded at acquisition cost 
at december   the carrying value of such intangibles was  million  which primarily related to the company s daytrana million  firazyr million  fosrenol million  pentasa million  reminyl million  replagal million  vyvanse million and xagrid million products 
those assets which do not yet have a defined revenue stream and for which there is no alternative future use are expensed upon acquisition  and those that do have a defined revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  the company reviews the intangible asset for impairment using an undiscounted net cash flow approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  based on estimated discounted cash flows 
when cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the impairment review is applied at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable 
the events or circumstances that may suggest that its intangible assets may not be recoverable  and which would lead to the company evaluating its intangible assets for impairment  include the following any change to the commercialization strategy in respect of a product  the loss of patent protection or challenge or circumvention by competitors of the company s patents  the development and marketing of competitive products  including generic entrants into the marketplace  any changes to the product labels  or other regulatory intervention  sustained government pressure on prices and  specifically  competitive pricing  the occurrence of significant adverse events in respect to the company s products  and a significant deterioration in a product s operating performance compared to expectations 
the occurrence of any such events  combined with changes in interest rates  could adversely affect shire s valuation of the estimated future net cash flows generated by its long lived assets 
following the identification of such events and the resultant impairment review  the company recognized impairment charges of million in respect to its intangible assets in the year to december  million  million  of which million related to dynepo which the company has decided to stop commercializing 
dependent on the occurrence of future events or circumstances  the company s operating results could be materially and adversely affected by impairment charges related to the recoverability of its long lived assets 
management s estimate of the useful life of its intangible assets considers  inter alia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the company  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life and the effects of demand  competition  including the launch of generic products  and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
the company reviews the useful life of its intangible assets subject to amortization at each reporting period  and revises its estimate of useful life if events or circumstances warrant 
in the year to december  the company decreased the estimated life of a product  which resulted in an additional amortization charge of million in each of the years to december   and any future changes to the useful life of the company s intangible assets could result in additional or lesser amortization expense in future periods which could materially affect operating results 
b intangible assets acquired through business combinations the fair values of all of the identifiable intangible assets acquired through business combinations  primarily the acquisitions of tkt in  new river in and the acquisition of more than a interest in jerini in have been determined using an income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows either generated or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual property  the customer relationships and the other intangible assets 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams to the extent the underlying cash flows have not similarly been risk adjusted 
the forecast of future cash flows requires various assumptions to be made  including revenue that is reasonably likely to result from the sale of products including the estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration and estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  royalty or license fees saved by owning the intellectual property associated with the products  cost of sales for the products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  the estimated life of the products  and the tax amortization benefit available to a market participant purchasing the assets piecemeal 
the valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by the company s management and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows 
c valuation of ipr d acquired through business combinations ipr d is defined by fin as being a development project that has been initiated and achieved material progress but i has not yet reached technological feasibility or has not yet reached the appropriate regulatory approval  ii has no alternative future use  and iii the fair value is estimable with reasonable certainty 
as required by fin  the portion of the purchase price ascribed to ipr d has been immediately expensed to the statement of operations in the year of the acquisition 
the company has expensed as ipr d the following amounts in respect of its significant business combinations million on acquisition of a majority voting interest in jerini in   million on acquisition of new river in  and million on acquisition of tkt in significant ipr d projects expensed to income include firazyr for the treatment of acute hae in the us and the rest of the world excluding the us and eu for the jerini acquisition  vyvanse indicated for adhd in non pediatric patients in the us and vyvanse indicated for adhd in the rest of the world on acquisition of new river 
in the year to december  the company also expensed ipr d totaling million for the acquisition of metazym from zymenex 
in the identification of intangible assets  consideration is given to whether any technology that is identified is developed or in process 
in making this determination the company considers the factors in the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries  which gives guidance on the factors that should be considered when identifying ipr d 
the fair value of ipr d acquired through business combinations is determined using the income approach on a project by project basis using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of the acquired ipr d assets has been based on the present value of probability adjusted incremental cash flows expected to be generated by the ipr d projects after the deduction of contributory asset charges for other assets employed in these projects 
this method includes risk factors  which include applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the project s stage of completion  the nature of the product  the scientific data associated with the technology  the current patent situation and market competition 
the forecast of future cash flows required the following assumptions to be made revenue that is likely to result from specific ipr d projects  including the likelihood of approval of the product  estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration  estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles  cost of sales related to the potential products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data  sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other market data  general and administrative expenses  r d expenses to complete the development of the acquired products  and the tax amortisation benefit available to a market participant purchasing the assets piecemeal 
the valuation process for ipr d involves a number of inter relating assumptions  such that the company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely completion of the acquired ipr d projects consist of the ability to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology based on the data from ongoing clinical trials and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals 
the valuations have been based on information at the time of the acquisition and expectations and assumptions that i have been deemed reasonable by shire s management  and ii are based on information  expectations and assumptions that would be available to and made by a market participant 
however  no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecast future cash flows 
ii valuation of equity investments the company has investments in certain public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed for other than temporary impairments whenever certain events or circumstances suggest that the cost of an investment exceeds the fair market value of the investment 
indicators of other than temporary impairment considered by the company  include  inter alia the market value of a quoted investment being below the cost of the investment  adverse news on a company s progress in scientific technology development of compounds  and recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price 
if the fair value appears to be below the cost of an investment the company considers all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include the length of time and or the extent to which the market value of the investee is less than the cost of the investment  the level of progress in the investee s scientific technology development of compound ongoing activity in collaborations with the investee  whether or not other substantial investee specific adverse events have occurred which may cause a decline in value  analysis and valuation of comparable companies  and the overall financial condition and near term prospects of the investee 
in instances when this review indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment  for private companies the company writes down the investment to the fair value of the investment 
for investments in public companies accounted for as available for sale securities any unrealized holding loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income by recording an other than temporary impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments and the determination of whether an unrealized loss on a publicly quoted investment is other than temporary requires significant judgment and can have a material impact on the reported results 
during  shire recorded impairments on long term investments in private companies of nil nil  million and an other than temporary impairment charge of million million  million for its available for sale securities  including million for its investment in renovo group plc 
during the third quarter of  the company considered the following factors in its determination of whether its impairment in renovo group plc was temporary or other than temporary the severity of the decline from historical cost decline and its duration eleven months  market analysts targets of renovo group plc s share price for the next months  and the revised expected filing date for juvista due to the adoption of a sequential rather than parallel phase development plan 
these factors  together with the significant decline in global equity markets during the third quarter of meant that the company was unable to reasonably estimate the period over which a full recovery in the value of its investment in renovo group plc could occur 
as such  at the end of the third quarter of the company concluded that the decline in value was other than temporary 
during the fourth quarter of  the value of the company s investment in renovo group plc further declined to million by december  the company has recognized this decline of million as a temporary impairment within other comprehensive income during the fourth quarter of iii sales deductions sales deductions consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  sales discounts including trade discounts and distribution service fees  wholesaler chargebacks  and allowances for coupon sampling programs 
these deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
the company accounts for these sales deductions in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  as applicable 
the company has the following significant categories of sales deductions  all of which involve estimates and judgments which the company considers to be critical accounting estimates  and require the company to use information from external sources medicaid and hmo rebates statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates to hmos under managed care programs are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the selling price 
medicaid rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product if prices increase faster than inflation 
as it can take up to six months for information to reach the company on actual usage of the company s products in managed care and medicaid programs and on the total discounts to be reimbursed  the company maintains reserves for amounts payable under these programs relating to sold products 
the amount of the reserve is based on historical experience of rebates  the timing of payments  the level of reimbursement claims  changes in prices both normal selling prices and statutory or negotiated prices  changes in prescription demand patterns  and the levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
shire s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel are based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers  results of independently commissioned retail inventory surveys and third party prescription data such as ims health national prescription audit data 
revisions or clarification of guidelines from cms related to state medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices with retroactive application can result in changes to management s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods 
however  since the prices of the company s products are fixed at the time of sale and the quantum of rebates is therefore reasonably determinable at the outset of each transaction  these factors would not impact the recording of revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the accrual estimation process for medicaid and hmo rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and medicaid agency or hmo 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
at the balance sheet date  accruals for medicaid and hmo rebates were million in  million in and million in  or   and  respectively  of net product sales 
historically  actual returns have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
product returns the company typically accepts customer product returns in the following circumstances a expiration of shelf life  b product damaged while in the possession of shire  or c under sales terms that allow for unconditional return guaranteed sales 
shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors  including past product returns activity  the duration of time taken for products to be returned  the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel  product recalls and discontinuances  the shelf life of products  the launch of new drugs or new formulations  and the loss of patent protection or new competition 
shire s estimate of the level of inventory in the distribution channel is based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers  third party prescription data and  for some product return provisions  market research of retail pharmacies 
returns for new products are more difficult for the company to estimate than for established products 
for shipments made to support the commercial launch of a new product which are typically guaranteed sales  as the company cannot determine customer acceptance of the new product  the company s policy is therefore to defer recognition of the sales revenue until there is evidence of end patient acceptance primarily third party prescription data  in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition 
for shipments after launch under standard terms ie not guaranteed sales  the company s initial estimates of sales return accruals are primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products shortly after launch 
once sufficient historical data on actual returns of the product are available  the returns provision is based on this data and any other relevant factors as noted above 
the accrual estimation process for product returns involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and customer 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
at the balance sheet date  provisions for product returns were million in  million in and million in  or  and  respectively  of net product sales 
historically  actual rebates have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
sales coupon accrual for certain products  primarily vyvanse  lialda  and daytrana  the company uses coupons as a form of sales incentive 
these coupons reimburse part or all of the cost of the first prescription 
each coupon can only be used once and coupons typically expire three to months after the date of issuance 
the company s management calculates an accrual for the estimated value of coupons that will be redeemed against sold products  based on the rebate value per coupon  the timing and volume of coupon distributions  the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel and expected coupon redemption rates  using historical trends and experience 
shire s estimate of the level of inventory in the distribution channel is based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers and third party prescription data 
shire believes that historical redemption rates  adjusted for known changes in coupon programs such as length of coupon life and redemption conditions are an appropriate basis for predicting future redemption rates 
for coupon programs open at december  the redemption rates assumed by shire range between and of coupons distributed depending on the life of the coupons 
a one percentage point increase in estimated coupon redemption rates would increase the provision at december  by million 
at december  the accrual for coupon redemptions was million million  million 
the accrual levels at december and within each financial year fluctuate according to the timing and volume of coupon distributions  in addition to changes in estimated redemption rates 
for rebates  returns and sales coupons the actual experience and the level of these deductions to revenue may deviate from the estimate 
shire reviews its estimates every quarter and may be required to adjust the estimate in a subsequent period 
historically  actual payments have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
iv income taxes in the application of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin management is required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefit should be recognized in the consolidated financial statements  based on whether it is more likely than not that the technical merits of the position will be sustained based on audit by the tax authorities 
the measurement of the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements is based upon the largest amount of tax benefit that  in management s judgment  is greater than likely to be realized based on a cumulative probability assessment of the possible outcomes 
in applying fin  management is required to make judgments in the determination of the unit of account  the evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information in respect of the tax position taken  together with the estimates of amounts that the company may be required to pay in ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
because shire operates globally  the nature of the uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
shire develops its cumulative probability assessment of the measurement of uncertain tax positions using internal expertise  experience  judgment and assistance from professional advisors 
estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from shire s best estimate may result in additional or lower tax expense in future periods 
at december  the company recognized a liability of million for total unrecognized tax benefits million and had accrued million million for the payment of interest and penalties 
the company has significant deferred tax assets due to net operating losses nols in the united states  the uk  ireland  germany and other countries 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods 
management is required to exercise judgment in determining whether it is more likely than not that it would realize these losses  based upon the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which these nols exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these nols a valuation allowance is held against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could materially impact the company s financial position and results 
at december   the company had deferred tax liabilities of million and gross deferred tax assets of million  against which the company had recorded valuation allowances of million 
at december   the company had deferred tax liabilities of million and gross deferred tax assets of million  against which the company had recorded valuation allowances of million 
at december   the company had deferred tax liabilities of million and gross deferred tax assets of million  against which the company had recorded valuation allowances of million 
v litigation the company has a number of lawsuits pending that relate to product liability and intellectual property infringement claims  see item legal proceedings of part ii of this annual report on form k for further details 
shire accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
best estimates are reviewed quarterly and estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from shire s best estimate may result in an additional or lesser expense in a future accounting period 
on november  the company announced that it had successfully settled all aspects of the tkt appraisal rights litigation with all parties 
shire paid the same price of per share originally offered to all tkt shareholders at the time of the july merger  plus interest 
the settlement represents a total payment of million  representing consideration at per share of million and an interest cost of million 
prior to reaching this settlement  the company accrued interest based on a reasonable estimate of the amount that may be awarded by the court to those former tkt shareholders who requested appraisal 
this estimate of interest was based on shire s cost of borrowing 
between the close of the merger and november  the company applied this interest rate on a quarterly compounding basis to the million of consideration to calculate its provision for interest 
upon reaching agreement in principle with all the dissenting shareholders  the company determined that settlement had become the probable manner through which the appraisal rights litigation would be resolved 
under current law  although not applicable in this case because the merger was entered into before the relevant amendment to the law became effective the court presumptively awards interest in appraisal rights cases at a statutory rate that is percentage points above the federal reserve discount rate as it varies over the duration of the case
