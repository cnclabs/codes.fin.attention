competition some of the drugs we are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pursuing ir related approaches to drug discovery and development 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors 
many of our existing or potential competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop  manufacture and market products 
many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 
for a discussion of the risks associated with competition  see below under item a 
risk factors 
government regulation the manufacturing and marketing of our products  our ongoing research and development activities and products being developed by our collaborative partners are subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceuticals are subject to rigorous regulation by federal and various state authorities  including the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products 
there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  the submission to the fda of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of an nda to the fda and the fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda and  in california  with the food and drug branch of california 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to pre approval inspections by the fda prior to marketing approval  then to biennial inspections  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with cgmp and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements after obtaining regulatory approval can  among other things  result in the suspension of regulatory approval  as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions 
in addition  changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect to us 

table of contents for marketing outside the united states before fda approval to market  we must submit an export permit application to the fda 
we also are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs 
the requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country and there can be no assurance that we or any of our partners will meet and sustain any such requirements 
we are also increasingly subject to regulation by the states 
a number of states now regulate  for example  pharmaceutical marketing practices and the reporting of marketing activities  controlled substances  clinical trials and general commercial practices 
we have developed and are developing a number of policies and procedures to ensure our compliance with these state laws  in addition to the federal regulations described above 
significant resources are now required on an ongoing basis to ensure such compliance 
for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations  see below under item a 
risk factors 
patents and proprietary rights we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
royalties we currently receive from king on avinza represent a significant portion of our ongoing revenue 
the united states patent on avinza expires in november  however  an application for a generic form of avinza has been submitted to the fda 
the united states patents relating to promacta do not expire until december subject to compliance with the terms of the respective agreements  our rights under our licenses with our exclusive licensors extend for the life of the patents covering such developments 
for a discussion of the risks associated with patent and proprietary rights  see below under item a 
risk factors 
human resources as of february   we had full time employees  of whom are involved directly in scientific research and development activities 
of these employees  hold phd or phd degrees 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following is a summary description of some of the many risks we face in our business 
you should carefully review these risks in evaluating our business  including the businesses of our subsidiaries 
you should also consider the other information described in this report 
risks related to us and our business 
we are substantially dependent on avinza and promacta royalties for our revenues 
king is obligated to pay us royalties based on its sales of avinza and gsk is obligated to pay us royalties on its sales of promacta 
these royalties represent and will for some time represent substantially all of our ongoing revenue 
although we may also receive royalties and milestones from our partners in various past and future collaborations  the amount of revenue from such royalties and milestones is unknown and highly uncertain 
as a result  any setback that may occur with respect to avinza or promacta could significantly impair our operating results and or reduce the market price of our stock 
setbacks could include problems with shipping  distribution  manufacturing  product safety  marketing  government licenses and approvals  intellectual property rights  competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the products  as well as higher than expected total rebates  returns or discounts 
king and gsk s sales efforts for avinza and promacta  respectively  could be affected by a number of factors and decisions regarding their organizations  operations  and activities as well as events both related and unrelated to avinza or promacta  including sales force reorganizations and lower than expected sales calls and prescription volumes 
avinza and promacta could also face stiffer competition from existing or future products 
the negative impact on the sales of avinza or promacta will negatively affect our royalties  revenues and earnings 
sales of avinza and promacta may also be negatively impacted by higher than expected discounts especially pharmacy benefit management group purchasing organization rebates and medicaid rebates  which can be substantial  returns and chargebacks and or slower than expected market penetration 
other setbacks that avinza could face in the sustained release opioid market include abuse issues and the inability to obtain sufficient quotas of morphine from the drug enforcement agency to support production requirements 
avinza or promacta could also face regulatory action and product safety issues 
for example  the fda previously requested expanded warnings on the avinza label to alert doctors and patients to the dangers of using avinza with alcohol 
changes were subsequently made to the label 
the fda also requested clinical studies to investigate the risks associated with taking avinza with alcohol 
any additional warnings  studies and any further regulatory action could have significant adverse effects on avinza sales 
on september   king reported that actavis  a manufacturer of generic pharmaceutical products headquartered in iceland  had filed with the fda an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  with a paragraph iv certification pertaining to avinza  the rights to which were acquired by king from us in february according to the report  actavis s paragraph iv certification sets forth allegations that us patent no 
 or the patent  which pertains to avinza  and which is listed in the fda s approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  will not be infringed by actavis s manufacture  use  or sale of the product for which the anda was submitted 
the expiration date for this patent is november king  king pharmaceuticals research and development  inc  elan corporation  plc and elan pharma international ltd 
jointly filed suit in federal district court in new jersey on october  against actavis  inc and actavis elizabeth llc for patent infringement under the patent 
the lawsuit seeks a judgment that would  among other things  prevent actavis from commercializing its proposed morphine product until after expiration of the patent 

table of contents avinza was licensed from elan corporation  or elan  which is its sole manufacturer 
any problems with elan s manufacturing operations or capacity could reduce sales of avinza  as could any licensing or other contract disputes with elan  raw materials suppliers  or others 
further  pursuant to the agreement with king  beginning in we will no longer be entitled to receive avinza royalties on a quarterly basis  but will collect royalties on an annual basis  which may adversely impact our cash flows 
our product candidates face significant regulatory hurdles prior to marketing which could delay or prevent sales 
before we obtain the approvals necessary to sell any of our potential products  we must show through preclinical studies and human testing that each product is safe and effective 
we and our partners have a number of products moving toward or currently awaiting regulatory action  including bazedoxifene  lasofoxifene  ps and ps failure to show any product s safety and effectiveness could delay or prevent regulatory approval of a product and could adversely affect our business 
the clinical trials process is complex and uncertain 
for example  the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials may not necessarily predict the results from later large scale clinical trials 
in addition  clinical trials may not demonstrate a product s safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities 
recently  a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials or in seeking regulatory approvals  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after regulatory approvals are received 
such additional trials may be expensive and time consuming  and failure to successfully conduct those trials could jeopardize continued commercialization of a product 
the rate at which we complete our clinical trials depends on many factors  including  but not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate supplies of the products to be tested and patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial 
delays in patient enrollment for our trials may result in increased costs and longer development times 
in addition  our collaborative partners have rights to control product development and clinical programs for products developed under the collaborations 
as a result  these collaborative partners may conduct these programs more slowly or in a different manner than expected 
moreover  even if clinical trials are completed  we or our collaborative partners still may not apply for fda approval in a timely manner or the fda still may not grant approval 
we rely heavily on collaborative relationships  and any disputes or litigation with our collaborative partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us  including milestone payments and future royalty revenues 
our strategy for developing and commercializing many of our potential products  including products aimed at larger markets  includes entering into collaborations with corporate partners and others 
these collaborations have provided us with funding and research and development resources for potential products for the treatment of a variety of diseases 
these agreements also give our collaborative partners significant discretion when deciding whether or not to pursue any development program 
our existing collaborations may not continue or be successful  and we may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  our collaborators may develop drugs  either alone or with others that compete with the types of drugs they are developing with us 
this would result in increased competition for our programs 
if products are approved for marketing under our collaborative programs  revenues we receive will depend on the manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts of our collaborative partners  who generally retain commercialization rights under the collaborative agreements 
generally  our current collaborative partners also have the right to terminate their collaborations under specified circumstances 
if any of our collaborative partners breach or 
table of contents terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully  our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated 
disputes or litigation may also arise with our collaborators  including disputes or litigation over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators 
such disputes or litigation could adversely affect our rights to one or more of our product candidates  including our ps  ps and lgd and other small molecule tpo mimetic compounds 
any such dispute or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the collaborative research  development and commercialization of certain potential products  create uncertainty as to ownership rights of intellectual property  or could result in litigation or arbitration 
the occurrence of any of these problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
if we consume cash more quickly than expected  and if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be forced to curtail operations 
our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception 
clinical and preclinical development of drug candidates is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
also  we may acquire companies  businesses or products and the consummation of such acquisitions may consume additional cash 
for example  as part of the consideration for our recent acquisition of pharmacopeia we distributed approximately million in cash to pharmacopeia stockholders 
security holders of pharmacopeia also received contingent value rights under which we could be required to make an aggregate cash payment of million to such security holders under certain circumstances 
we believe that our capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations at their current levels at least for the next twelve months 
however  changes may occur that would cause us to consume available capital resources before that time 
examples of relevant potential changes that could impact our capital resources include the costs associated with our drug research and development activities  and additional costs we may incur if our development programs are delayed or are more expensive to implement than we currently anticipate  changes in existing collaborative relationships  including the funding we receive in connection with those relationships  the progress of our milestone and royalty producing activities  acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  the termination of our lease agreements  the purchase of additional capital equipment  cash payments or refunds we may be required to make pursuant to certain agreements with third parties  competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the outcome of related litigation 
additional capital may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if additional capital is not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into arrangements with partners or other third parties that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish 

table of contents if  as the result of a merger  or otherwise  our collaborative partners were to change their strategy or the focus of their development and commercialization efforts with respect to our alliance products  the success of our alliance products could be adversely affected 
our collaborative partners may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts as the result of a merger 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have historically re evaluated their priorities from time to time  including following mergers and consolidations which are common in these industries  and two of our collaborative partners have recently entered into merger agreements 
in january  wyeth  a collaborative partner of ours  and pfizer announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which pfizer will acquire wyeth in a cash and stock transaction 
furthermore  in march  schering plough corporation  another of our collaborative partners  and merck co  inc  or merck  announced that their boards of directors have unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which merck and schering plough will combine  under the name merck  in a stock and cash transaction 
as a result of the consummation of these mergers our collaborative partners may develop and commercialize  either alone or with others  products and services that are similar to or competitive with our alliance products 
furthermore  the ability of our alliance products to reach their potential could be limited if our collaborative partners reduce or fail to increase spending related to such products as a result of these mergers 
if our collaborative partners terminate their collaborations with us or do not commit sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or distribution of our alliance products  we could be required to devote additional resources to our alliance products  seek new collaborative partners or abandon such alliance products  all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
third party intellectual property may prevent us or our partners from developing our potential products and we may owe a portion of any payments we receive from our collaborative partners to one or more third parties 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
in addition  disputes with licensors under our license agreements may arise which could result in additional financial liability or loss of important technology and potential products and related revenue  if any 
further  the manufacture  use or sale of our potential products or our collaborative partners products or potential products may infringe the patent rights of others 
this could impact avinza  promacta  bazedoxifene  lasofoxifene  lgd  ps  ps and any other products or potential products 
several drug companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents for technologies that may be related to our business 
others have filed patent applications and received patents that conflict with patents or patent applications we have licensed for our use  either by claiming the same methods or compounds or by claiming methods or compounds that could dominate those licensed to us 
in addition  we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make  use or sell any of our potential products 
for example  us patent applications may be kept confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six months or more after filing 
on march   rockefeller filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  against us alleging  among other things  a breach by us of our september  license agreement with rockefeller  as well as other causes of action for unjust enrichment  quantum meruit  specific performance to perform an audit and declaratory relief 
in february we reached a settlement with rockefeller whereby the parties resolved all disputes that have arisen between them  including rockefeller s primary claim relating to the development of promacta as well our counterclaims 
see item legal proceedings 
other possible disagreements or litigation with our collaborative partners could delay our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve milestones or our receipt of other payments 
in addition  other 
table of contents possible disagreements or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the research  development and commercialization of certain potential products being developed by either our collaborative partners or by us 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
third parties have not directly threatened an action or claim against us  although we do periodically receive other communications or have other conversations with the owners of other patents or other intellectual property 
if others obtain patents with conflicting claims  we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products 
in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from a settlement or an adverse outcome 
however  a settlement or an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
we may not be able to hire and or retain key employees 
if we are unable to hire and or retain key employees  we may not have sufficient resources to successfully manage our assets or our business  and we may not be able to perform our obligations under various contracts and commitments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of pharmacopeia s key management and scientific personnel 
if we fail to retain such key employees  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 
either of these could have substantial negative impacts on our business and our stock price 
our stock price has been volatile and could experience a sudden decline in value 
our common stock has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future 
as a result  you may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the latest market price if trading in our stock is not active or the volume is low 
many factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including  but not limited to  the following factors results of or delays in our preclinical studies and clinical trials  the success of our collaboration agreements  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or others  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or others  developments in patent or other proprietary rights by us or others  comments or opinions by securities analysts or major stockholders  future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  regulatory developments or changes in regulatory guidance  litigation or threats of litigation  economic and other external factors or other disaster or crises  the departure of any of our officers  directors or key employees  period to period fluctuations in financial results  and limited daily trading volume 
the financial industry regulatory authority  or finra  formerly the national association of securities dealers  inc and the securities and exchange commission  or sec  have adopted certain new rules 
if we were unable to continue to comply with the new rules  we could be delisted from trading on the nasdaq global market  or nasdaq  and thereafter trading in our common stock  if any  would be conducted through the over the counter market or on the electronic bulletin board of finra 
as a consequence of such delisting  an investor would likely find it more difficult to dispose of  or to obtain quotations as to the price of  our common stock 
delisting of our common stock could also result in lower prices per share of our common stock than would otherwise prevail 

table of contents we may not be successful in entering into additional out license agreements on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our liquidity or require us to alter development plans on our products 
we have entered into several out licensing agreements for the development and commercialization of our products 
although we expend considerable resources on internal research and development for our proprietary programs  we may not be successful in entering into additional out licensing agreements under favorable terms due to several factors including the difficulty in creating valuable product candidates that target large market opportunities  research and spending priorities of potential licensing partners  willingness of and the resources available to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to in license product candidates for their clinical pipelines  or differences of opinion with potential partners on the valuation of products we are seeking to out license 
the inability to enter into out licensing agreements under favorable terms and to earn milestone payments  license fees and or upfront fees may adversely affect our liquidity and may force us to curtail or delay development of some or all of our proprietary programs  which in turn may harm our business and the value of our stock 
our product development involves a number of uncertainties  and we may never generate sufficient collaborative payments and royalties from the development of products to become profitable 
we were founded in we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
most of our products in development will require extensive additional development  including preclinical testing and human studies  as well as regulatory approvals  before they can be marketed 
we cannot predict if or when any of the products we are developing or those being developed with our partners will be approved for marketing 
there are many reasons why we or our collaborative partners may fail in our efforts to develop our potential products  including the possibility that preclinical testing or human studies may show that our potential products are ineffective or cause harmful side effects  the products may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the fda or foreign authorities in a timely manner  or at all  the products  if approved  may not be produced in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs  the products  if approved  may not achieve commercial acceptance  regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to our products  which could adversely affect their commercial success  or the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our partners from marketing the products 
any product development failures for these or other reasons  whether with our products or our partners products  may reduce our expected revenues  profits  and stock price 
the past restatement of our consolidated financial statements increased the possibility of legal or administrative proceedings 
any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence on our financial reporting  our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business 
we determined that our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  and for the first three quarters of  as described in more detail in our annual report on form k  should be restated 
as a result of the restatement  we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties 
we expect to continue to incur unanticipated accounting and legal costs as noted below 
in addition  the sec has instituted a formal investigation into our restated consolidated financial statements 
table of contents identified above 
this investigation will likely continue to divert more of our management s time and attention and cause us to continue to incur substantial costs 
such investigations can also lead to fines or injunctions or orders with respect to future activities  as well as further substantial costs and diversion of management time and attention 
while no material weaknesses were identified as of december   we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in future periods 
the existence of one or more material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements 
substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards  we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports  our business and financial condition could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  or the market price of our stock could decline significantly 
in addition  our ability to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business  or obtain additional financing on favorable terms  could be materially and adversely affected  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  our financial condition and the market value of our securities 
moreover  our reputation with customers  lenders  investors  securities analysts and others may be adversely affected 
challenges to or failure to secure patents and other proprietary rights may significantly hurt our business 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patents and proprietary rights for our potential products both in the united states and in foreign countries 
patents may not be issued from any of these applications currently on file  or  if issued  may not provide sufficient protection 
our patent position  like that of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the technology we own or have licensed 
in addition  others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license and rights we receive under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
we have had and will continue to have discussions with our current and potential collaborative partners regarding the scope and validity of our patents and other proprietary rights 
if a collaborative partner or other party successfully establishes that our patent rights are invalid  we may not be able to continue our existing collaborations beyond their expiration 
any determination that our patent rights are invalid also could encourage our collaborative partners to seek early termination of our agreements 
such invalidation could adversely affect our ability to enter into new collaborations 
we may also need to initiate litigation  which could be time consuming and expensive  to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others rights 
if litigation occurs  a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor s rights 
in addition  if any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the united states which claim technology we also have invented  the united states patent and trademark office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to protect and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  collaborative partners and others to sign confidentiality agreements when they begin their relationship with us 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our competitors may independently discover our trade secrets 

table of contents we will have continuing obligations to indemnify the buyers of our commercial product lines  and may be subject to other liabilities related to the sale of our commercial product lines 
in connection with the sale of our avinza product line  we have agreed to indemnify king in certain cases for a period of months after the closing of the sale of the avinza product line in february  including any breach of certain representations  warranties or covenants contained in the asset purchase agreement 
in addition  we have agreed to indemnify eisai  the purchaser of our oncology product line  for damages suffered by eisai arising from any breach of our representations  warranties  covenants or obligations in the asset purchase agreement 
our obligation to indemnify eisai extends beyond the closing of the sale of our oncology product line in october up to  in some cases  months and  in other cases  until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 
in a few instances  our obligation to indemnify eisai survives in perpetuity 
under certain circumstances  the asset purchase agreement for the avinza product line also allows king to set off indemnification claims against the royalty payments payable to us  including avinza royalty payments 
under the asset purchase agreements  our exposure for any indemnification claim brought by king or eisai is limited to million and million  respectively 
however  in certain matters  our indemnification obligation is not subject to the foregoing limits on liability 
for example  we are obligated to indemnify king  without limitation  for all liabilities arising under certain agreements with catalent pharma solutions related to the manufacture of avinza 
similarly  we are obligated to indemnify eisai  without limitation  for all liabilities related to certain claims regarding promotional materials for the ontak and targretin drug products 
we cannot predict the liabilities that may arise as a result of these matters 
any claims related to our indemnification obligations to king or eisai could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
as previously disclosed  in connection with the avinza sale transaction  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which was million as of december  
as organon did not consent to the legal assignment of the co promote termination obligation from us to king  we remain liable to organon in the event king defaults on this obligation 
any requirement to pay a material amount to organon  could adversely affect our business and the price of our securities 
the sale of our commercial product lines also exposes us to product liability risks on products we sold prior to divesting these product lines 
for example  such products may need to be recalled to address regulatory issues 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could result in payment of significant amounts of money and divert management s attention from running our business 
we believe that we carry reasonably adequate insurance for product liability claims 
however  we may not be able to maintain our insurance on commercially reasonable terms  or our insurance may not provide adequate protection in the case of a product liability claim 
to the extent that product liability insurance  if available  does not cover potential claims  we will be required to self insure the risks associated with such claims 
if our partners do not reach the market with our alliance products before our competitors offer products for the same or similar uses  or if our partners are not effective in marketing our alliance products  our revenues from product sales  if any  will be reduced 
we face intense competition in our development activities 
our competitors might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than our partners can for our products 
in addition  competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive and perceived to be safer or more effective than those being developed by us or our partners  which could impair our product development and render our technology obsolete 

table of contents we use hazardous materials  which may expose us to significant liability 
in connection with our research and development activities  we handle hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
to properly dispose of these hazardous materials in compliance with environmental regulations  we are required to contract with third parties 
we believe that we carry reasonably adequate insurance for toxic tort claims 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk or predict the exposure of accidental contamination or injury from the handling and disposing of hazardous materials  whether by us or our third party contractors 
any accident in the handling and disposing of hazardous materials may expose us to significant liability 
our shareholder rights plan and charter documents may hinder or prevent change of control transactions 
our shareholder rights plan and provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock without any further action by the stockholders 
such restrictions and issuances may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our ownership 
if changes in our ownership are discouraged  delayed or prevented  it would be more difficult for our current board of directors to be removed and replaced  even if you or our other stockholders believe that such actions are in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
we may lose some or all of the value of some of our short term investments 
we engage one or more third parties to manage some of our cash consistent with an investment policy that allows a range of investments and maturities 
the investments are intended to maintain safety of principal while providing liquidity adequate to meet projected cash requirements 
risks of principal loss are to be minimized through diversified short and medium term investments of high quality  but the investments are not in every case guaranteed or fully insured 
as a result of changes in the credit market  one of our short term investments in commercial paper is in default 
we intend to pursue collection efforts  but we might not recoup some or all of our investment in the commercial paper 
in addition  from time to time we may suffer other losses on our short term investment portfolio 
we may require additional money to run our business and may be required to raise this money on terms which are not favorable to us or which reduce our stock price 
we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings to fund our operations 
our inability to obtain additional financing could adversely affect our business 
financings may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
in addition  these financings  if completed  may not meet our capital needs and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or drug development programs 
we may also be required to liquidate our business or file for bankruptcy protection 
alternatively  we may be forced to attempt to continue development by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish some or all of our rights to technologies or drug candidates that we would not otherwise relinquish 
our drug development programs will require substantial additional future funding which could hurt our operational and financial condition 
our drug development programs require substantial additional capital to successfully complete them  arising from costs to conduct research  preclinical testing and human studies  establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities  and establish and develop quality control  regulatory  marketing  sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs 

table of contents our future operating and capital needs will depend on many factors  including the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and human studies  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish additional collaborations  changes in our existing collaborations  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and the effectiveness of our commercialization activities 
we expect our research and development expenditures over the next three years to continue to be significant 
however  we base our outlook regarding the need for funds on many uncertain variables 
such uncertainties include regulatory approvals  the timing of events outside our direct control such as product launches by partners and the success of such product launches  negotiations with potential strategic partners  possible sale of assets or other transactions and other factors 
any of these uncertain events can significantly change our cash requirements 
while we expect to fund our research and development activities from cash generated from avinza and promacta royalties and royalties and milestones from our partners in various past and future collaborations to the extent possible  if we are unable to do so  we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings or seek other external means of financing 
these financings could depress our stock price 
if additional funds are required to support our operations and we are unable to obtain them on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further development or commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge with another entity 
significant returns of products we sold prior to selling our commercial businesses could harm our operating results 
under our agreements to sell our commercial businesses  we remain financially responsible for returns of our products sold before those businesses were transferred to their respective buyers 
consequently  if returns of those products are higher than expected  we could incur substantial expenses for processing and issuing refunds for those returns which  in turn  could negatively impact our financial results 
the amount of returns could be affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to  ongoing product demand  product rotation at distributors and wholesalers  and product stability issues 
our results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn 
our results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary  and our stock price may further decline 
our investment securities consist primarily of money market funds  corporate debt obligations and us government agency securities 
we do not have any auction rate securities 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed securities and the resultant effects on various securities markets 
we cannot provide assurance that our investments are not subject to adverse changes in market value 
if our investments experience adverse changes in market value  we may have less capital to fund our operations 

table of contents we may be unable to successfully integrate the business of pharmacopeia and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 
in december  we completed our merger with pharmacopeia 
the success of the merger will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies  growth opportunities and cost savings from integrating pharmacopeia s business with our business 
our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful integration of the operations of pharmacopeia 
the integration of two independent companies is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees  diversion of each company s management s attention  the disruption or interruption of  or the loss of momentum in  each company s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies  any of which could adversely affect either company s ability to maintain relationships with licensors  collaborators  partners  suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger  or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company and  as a result  adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect to incur significant costs and commit significant management time integrating pharmacopeia s business operations  technology  development programs  products and personnel with those of ours 
if we do not successfully integrate the business of pharmacopeia  the expenditure of these costs will reduce our cash position 
impairment charges pertaining to goodwill  identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets from the merger with pharmacopeia could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
the total purchase price pertaining to our merger with pharmacopeia has been allocated to pharmacopeia s net tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  in process research and development and goodwill 
to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets become impaired  we will be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment 
any impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could adversely affect our stock price  operating results and results of operations 
we may acquire companies  businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
integrating any newly acquired business could be expensive and time consuming 
integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult or expensive than we predict 
the diversion of our management s attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions we may consummate could result in the disruption of our on going business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect our ability to maintain third party relationships 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  or issue additional shares  to acquire any businesses or products  which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness 
as part of our efforts to acquire companies  business or product candidates or to enter into other significant transactions  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction 
despite our efforts  we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and  as a result  might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions we may consummate in the future  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties  regulatory setbacks and other events  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we acquire product candidates  we will also need to make certain assumptions about  among other things  development costs  the likelihood of receiving regulatory approval and the market for such product candidates 
our assumptions may prove to be incorrect  which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

table of contents in addition  we will likely experience significant charges to earnings in connection with our efforts  if any  to consummate acquisitions 
for transactions that are ultimately not consummated  these charges may include fees and expenses for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisors in connection with our efforts 
even if our efforts are successful  we may incur  as part of a transaction  substantial charges for closure costs associated with elimination of duplicate operations and facilities and acquired in process research and development charges 
in either case  the incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 
the drug research and development industry is highly competitive and subject to technological change  and we may not have the resources necessary to compete successfully 
many of our competitors have access to greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution  service and other resources than we do 
moreover  the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by continuous technological innovation 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and our competitors make advanced technologies available 
technological advances or entirely different approaches that we or one or more of our competitors develop may render our products  services and expertise obsolete or uneconomical 
additionally  the existing approaches of our competitors or new approaches or technologies that our competitors develop may be more effective than those we develop 
we may not be able to compete successfully with existing or future competitors 
we have excess space available for sublease at our facilities and we may not be able to find qualified sublease tenants 
we have entered into long term  non cancellable real estate arrangements for space which  as a result of reductions in our workforce and our acquisition of pharmacopeia  are considered to be in excess of our current requirements 
we currently have a tenant who is subleasing one of our facilities and we are actively looking for additional sublease tenants to sublease up to approximately  square feet of vacant space or space that could be made available through changes in the current layout of our operations 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements 
however  the commercial real estate market conditions in the united states have resulted in a surplus of business facilities making it difficult to sublease properties 
if we are unable to find additional sublease tenants we may not meet our expected estimated levels of sublease income or we may be required to terminate these leases at a substantial cost  and  accordingly  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we currently occupy an  square foot office and laboratory facility in san diego  california leased through november  which is a building we previously owned and sold and leased back on november  we lease approximately  square feet in three facilities in cranbury  new jersey under leases that expire in we believe these facilities are adequate to meet our space requirements for the foreseeable future 
we also lease a  square foot facility in san diego that is leased through july in january  we began subleasing the  square foot facility under a sublease through july we fully vacated this facility in february

on march   rockefeller filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  against us alleging  among other things  a breach by us of our september  license agreement with rockefeller  as well as other causes of action for unjust enrichment  quantum meruit  specific performance to perform an audit and declaratory relief 
in february  we reached a settlement with rockefeller whereby the parties resolved all disputes that have arisen between them  including rockefeller s primary claim relating to the development of promacta as well our counterclaims 
as part of the settlement  the parties executed mutual releases and agreed to jointly seek dismissal with prejudice of all claims  demands and causes of action  whether known or unknown  arising out of or based upon the license agreement  the ongoing litigation  promacta  lgd  and any other compound developed by us that was subject to the license agreement

on october   we received notice that a putative class action complaint was filed in the superior court of new jersey  mercer county equity division by allen heilman  one of phamacopeia s stockholders  against pharmacopeia  the members of its board of directors  us and two of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the complaint generally alleges that pharmacopeia s board of directors decision to enter into the proposed transaction with us on the terms contained in the proposed merger agreement constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty and gives rise to other unspecified state law claims 
the complaint also alleges that we and two of our wholly owned subsidiaries aided and abetted pharmacopeia s board of directors breach of fiduciary duty 
in addition  the complaint alleges that the named plaintiff will seek equitable relief  including among other things  an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the proposed transaction 
while we believe that neither ligand nor pharmacopeia engaged in any wrongful acts  in an effort to minimize the cost and expense of any litigation  in december  we entered into a memorandum of understanding  or mou  with the named plaintiff providing for the settlement of the lawsuit 
subject to court approval and further definitive documentation  the mou provides a release and settlement by the purported class of all claims against pharmacopeia  us  and our affiliates and agents in connection with the complaint 
pursuant to the mou we have agreed not to oppose any fee application by plaintiffs counsel that does not exceed million  which has been recorded as a liability at december  
table of contents in addition  from time to time we are subject to various lawsuits and claims with respect to matters arising out of the normal course of our business 
due to the uncertainty of the ultimate outcome of these matters  the impact on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimates

pharmacopeia was a clinical development stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics to address significant medical needs 
pharmacopeia s strategy was to retain the rights to product candidates at least to clinical validation  and to continue development on its own new drug application  or nda  filings and commercialization for selected indications 
pharmacopeia had a broad portfolio of clinical and preclinical candidates under development internally or by partners 
our business strategy includes a targeted internal drug research and early stage development capabilities 
we believe that we have promising product candidates throughout our internal development programs 
we also

write off of in process research and development for acquisitions prior to january   the fair value of acquired in process research and development ipr d projects  which have no alternative future use and which have not reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition were immediately expensed 
we wrote off million of acquired in process research and development related to the acquisition of pharmacopeia  inc in the amount is related to internal and partnered product candidates targeting a variety of indications and currently in various stages of development ranging from preclinical to phase ii 
of the total amount  million relates to product candidates currently in the preclinical stage of development  million relates to product candidates currently in phase i clinical trials and million relates to product candidates currently in phase ii clinical trials 
we used the income method to determine the estimated fair values of acquired in process research and development  which uses a discounted cash flow model and applies a probability weighting based on estimates of successful product development and commercialization to estimated future net cash flows resulting from projected revenues and related costs 
these success rates take into account the stages of completion and the risks surrounding successful development and commercialization of the underlying product candidates 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of for product candidates in the preclinical stage  for product candidates currently in phase i clinical trials and for product candidates currently in phase ii clinical trials 
the above assumptions were used solely for the purposes of estimating fair values of these product candidates as of the date of their acquisition 
however  we cannot provide assurance that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of development and commercialization will materialize  as estimated 
consequently  the eventual realized value of the acquired in process research and development may vary from its estimated value at the date of acquisition

the deferred gain is recognized as an offset to operating expense on a straight line basis over the year term of the lease at a rate of approximately million per year 
interest income interest income was million for  compared to million for and million for the decrease from to is due to lower cash and investment balances as a result of the million cash dividend paid on april   as well as lower interest rates

on a quarterly basis  management reviews the carrying value and assesses the co promote termination receivable for impairment eg in the event king defaults on the assumed obligation to pay organon 
annually 
table of contents management also reviews the carrying value of the co promote termination liability 
due to assumptions and judgments inherent in determining the estimates of future net avinza sales through november  the actual amount of net avinza sales used to determine the amount of the asset and liability for a particular period may be materially different from current estimates 
any resulting changes to the co promote termination liability will have a corresponding impact on the co promote termination payments receivable 
as of december  and  the fair value of the co promote termination liability and the corresponding receivable was determined using a discount rate of 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value of our long lived assets is determined using the expected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
as of december   we believe that the future undiscounted cash flows to be received from our long lived assets will exceed the assets carrying value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
as of december  and  we have provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset as recoverability was uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
stock based compensation we have employee compensation plans under which various types of stock based instruments are granted 
we account for our share based payments in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statements of income as compensation expense based on their estimated fair values generally over the vesting period of the awards 
stock based compensation cost for awards to employees and non employee directors is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period until the last tranche vests 
compensation cost for consultant awards is recognized over each separate tranche s vesting period 
we recognized compensation expense of million  million and million for  and  respectively  associated with option awards  restricted stock and an equitable adjustment of employee stock options 
of the total compensation expense associated with option awards  million related to options granted to non employee consultants for of the total compensation expense associated with the option awards for  million related to the equitable adjustment of the exercise price for all options outstanding as of april  that was measured for financial reporting purposes effective march   the date our compensation committee of our board of directors approved the adjustment 

table of contents the fair value for options that were awarded to employees and directors was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected volatility expected term years years years the expected term of the employee and non employee director options is the estimated weighted average period until exercise or cancellation of vested options forfeited unvested options are not considered 
sab guidance permits companies to use a safe harbor expected term assumption for grants up to december  based on the mid point of the period between vesting date and contractual term  averaged on a tranche by tranche basis 
we used the safe harbor in selecting the expected term assumption in and the expected term for consultant awards is the remaining period to contractual expiration 
volatility is a measure of the expected amount of variability in the stock price over the expected life of an option expressed as a standard deviation 
sfas r requires an estimate of future volatility 
in selecting this assumption  we used the historical volatility of our stock price over a period equal to the expected term 
changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation would impact the amount of compensation expenses recognized during the period 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued fasb fsp which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
these nonfinancial items include assets and liabilities such as reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and nonfinancial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
effective january   we adopted sfas for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r requires an acquirer to i recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date  ii recognize acquisition related costs separately from the acquisition  iii to recognize negative goodwill in earnings as a gain attributable to the acquisition  and iv to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of the business combination either in earnings in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital  depending on the circumstances 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  and  as such  will be applied prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after january  in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas requires entities to present ownership 
table of contents interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent entity within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet  to present the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of operations  to recognize any changes in ownership interests as equity transactions  and to measure at fair value any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
we will adopt sfas in the first interim period of fiscal  and management is evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of this statement will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas requires entities to disclose the objectives for using derivative instruments in terms of underlying risk and accounting designation  to disclose the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format  and to disclose information about credit risk related contingent features 
we will adopt sfas in the first interim period of fiscal  and management is evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of this statement will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   we also have certain equipment financing arrangements with variable rates of interest 
due to the relative insignificance of such arrangements  however  an immediate change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
we do not have a significant level of transactions denominated in currencies other than us dollars and as a result we have very limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
