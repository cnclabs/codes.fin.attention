in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
factors that could cause such differences include those described in item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview soundbite communications provides on demand  integrated multi channel customer communications solutions consisting of automated voice messaging  or avm  email and text messaging services 
clients use our service to initiate and manage campaigns for a variety of collections  customer care and marketing processes 
we sell our service primarily through our direct sales force 
our clients are located principally in the united states  with a limited number located in canada and the united kingdom 
our strategy to achieve long term  sustained growth in our revenues and net income is focused on building upon our leadership in the avm market and using our on demand platform to extend our service by  for example  developing new features and complementary services targeted to enable mission critical applications across a number of industries 
in line with this strategy  in february we acquired mobile collect  a provider of free to end user  or fteu  text messaging 
we intend to market these services across industries such as telecommunications  financial services  collections  retail and utilities 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive for the foreseeable future  substantially all of our revenues by providing our avm services to businesses and other organizations 
in order to execute our business strategy  we must continue to develop and market additional communications solutions such as our text and email services and also must expand the depth and number of our client relationships 
we will continue our efforts to expand our presence in large in house  or first party  collection departments  while also seeking to leverage our existing first party relationships with large businesses to facilitate introductions and sales to other functional groups within those businesses 
key components of results of operations revenues we currently derive substantially all of our revenues by providing avm services 
we provide avm services  as well as text and email messaging services  under a usage based pricing model  with prices calculated on a per message or per minute basis in accordance with the terms of its pricing agreements with clients 
we invoice clients on a monthly basis 
our pricing agreements with clients do not require minimum levels of usage or payments 
each executed message represents a transaction from which we derive revenues  and we therefore recognize revenue based on actual usage within a calendar month 
we do not recognize revenue until we can determine that persuasive 
table of contents evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and we deem collection to be probable 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of telephony charges  as well as depreciation expenses for our telephony infrastructure and expenses related to hosting and providing support for our platform 
cost of revenues also includes compensation expense for our operations personnel 
as we continue to grow our business and add features and complementary services to our platform  we expect cost of revenues will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis 
our gross margin ranged from to for  and we currently are targeting a quarterly gross margin of to for the foreseeable future 
our gross margin for a quarter may vary significantly from our target for a number of reasons  including the mix of types of messaging campaigns executed during the quarter and the extent to which we build our infrastructure through  for example  significant acquisitions of hardware or material increases in leased data center facilities 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses and depreciation expense of certain equipment related to the development of our service 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on improving and enhancing our platform as well as developing new features and functionality 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  including sales commissions  as well as the costs of our marketing programs 
we expect to further invest in developing our marketing strategy and activities to extend brand awareness and generate additional leads for our sales staff 
in late october  we terminated sales and marketing positions in order to lower our costs of operations 
compensation expense was unaffected by this action in the fourth quarter of  however  as termination costs offset the cost savings resulting from the reduction in headcount 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation expenses for executive  finance  accounting  administrative and management information systems personnel  accounting and legal professional fees and other corporate expenses 
in late october  we terminated two positions in order to lower our costs of operations 
we expect  however  to continue to incur additional costs associated with being a public company  including the costs of implementing and maintaining new financial systems to enable us to meet our financial reporting and regulatory compliance requirements  including those under the sarbanes oxley act 
additional key measures of financial performance we present information below with respect to cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
free cash flow is a measure of financial performance calculated as cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment 
management uses these metrics to track business performance 
due to the current economic environment  management decisions are based in part  on a goal of maintaining positive cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
we believe these metrics are useful measures of the performance of our business because  in contrast to income statement metrics that rely principally on revenue and profitability  cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow capture the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year and the effect of noncash items such as depreciation and stock based compensation 
we believe that  for similar reasons  these metrics are often used by security analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of on demand and other software companies 
the term free cash flow is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with 
table of contents gaap 
all or a portion of free cash flow may be unavailable for discretionary expenditures 
free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool  and when assessing our operating performance  you should not consider free cash flow in isolation from  or as a substitute for  data such as net income loss  derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
as of december  in thousands cash flows from operating activities purchases of property and equipment free cash flow non gaap the cash flow from operating activities in reflected a a net loss of million  b non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million  and c a decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets of  these changes were partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of  due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
the net loss of million includes million received in connection with the settlement of the lawsuit with universal recovery systems  offset by million of related expenses 
the cash flow from operating activities in reflected a net income of  b non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million and a preferred stock warrant charge of  and c an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million 
these changes reflected the growth in our business  the timing of payments to our vendors and the addition of non cash charges related to carrying certain warrants at fair value prior to our initial public offering 
these changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables of million due to revenue growth in our business and an increase of  in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the cash flow from operating activities in reflected a a net loss of  b non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million and preferred stock warrant charge of  and c an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of million 
these changes resulted primarily from growth in our business and the timing of payments to vendors 
these changes were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivables of million due to revenue growth in our business and an increase of  in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
free cash flow in each of the years presented reflects  in addition to the factors driving cash flow from operating activities  our purchases of property and equipment  which consists primarily of computer equipment and software 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment  complexity and effect on materiality 
a critical accounting policy is one that both is material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we regularly assess our ability to collect outstanding client invoices and in so doing must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine 
table of contents that the collection of an outstanding client receivable is not probable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  client creditworthiness  and changes in our client payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if any of these factors change  our estimates may also change  which could affect the levels of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
valuation of goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we typically evaluate goodwill on an annual basis for impairment  and we have selected november as the annual impairment testing date 
however  during the third and fourth quarters of  we determined that impairment triggering events had occurred as a result of the economic environment impacting our business and operating results and on a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
if our stock price and other valuation indicators do not increase  future goodwill impairment charges may occur 
as of december   we also concluded that we have one reporting unit under which to assess goodwill 
stock based compensation prior to  we accounted for stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
the intrinsic value represents the difference between the per share market price of the stock on the grant date and the per share exercise price of the related stock option 
we typically grant stock options to employees for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the grant date 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense was recorded for employee stock options granted at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the grant date 
for stock options granted with an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the grant date  we recognized compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of the sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation costs with respect to an employee are measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date  and are recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period  which generally is the vesting period 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
under this transition method  non vested option awards outstanding prior to january  continued to be accounted for in accordance with apb opinion no 
we account for all awards granted or modified on or after january  using the measurement  recognition and attribution provisions of sfas no 
r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value our option grants and determine the related compensation expense 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
the company estimates expected volatility based on that of the company s publicly traded peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as the company has adequate historical data 
the comparable peer companies selected are publicly traded companies with similar operations as determined by the company s board of directors 
management believes that the historical volatility of the company s stock price does not best represent the expected volatility of the stock price 
the company intends to continue to consistently use the same group of publicly traded peer companies to determine volatility in the future until 
table of contents such time that sufficient information regarding the volatility of its share price becomes available or that the selected companies are no longer suitable for this purpose 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant was equal to the monthly seven year us treasury bill rate  the term of which approximates the expected life of the option 
the expected term of options granted was determined based on the simplified method in which the expected term is equal to the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term 
we reviewed sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and concluded to continue using the simplified method to determine the expected term of our stock options 
our company stock has been publicly traded for slightly over one year  and therefore  there is not sufficient historical share option experience to estimate the expected term 
the stock price volatility and expected terms utilized in the calculation of fair values involve management s best estimates at that time  both of which impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option 
sfas no 
r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portions of options that are expected to vest 
we therefore are required to estimate expected forfeitures of stock options 
in developing a forfeiture rate estimate  we have considered our historical experience  our growing employee base and prior to our initial public offering  the limited liquidity of our common stock 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense might be required in future periods 
compensation expense associated with share based awards totaled  for   for and  for these amounts were based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflected an estimate of awards that would be forfeited 
the total compensation cost under sfas no 
r related to share based awards granted to employees and directors but not yet amortized  net of estimated forfeitures  was million as of december  these costs will be amortized on a straight line basis over a weighted average period of years for income taxes we are subject to federal and various state income taxes in the united states  and we use estimates in determining our provision for these income taxes 
in addition  we are subject to canadian taxes for profits generated from our wholly owned subsidiary 
deferred tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities are determined separately by tax jurisdiction 
in making these determinations  we estimate tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities and we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
at december   our deferred tax assets consisted primarily of federal net operating loss carryforwards  state research and development credit carryforwards  and temporary differences 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized  and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment that is subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business

liquidity and capital resources resources since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from issuances of preferred stock  borrowings under credit facilities and  more recently  cash flow from operations and the proceeds from our initial public offering in november we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  our cash flow from operating activities  and our borrowings available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rates of our revenue growth  our introduction of new features and complementary services for our on demand service  and our expansion of research and development and sales and marketing activities 
to the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products 
if additional funding is required

this credit facility expired by its terms on july  we expect to enter into a replacement bank credit facility by april silicon valley bank has continued to honor letters of credit under the july credit facility  and as of december   we had utilized  in connection with our facility leases

working capital the following table sets forth selected working capital information as of december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts working capital our cash and cash equivalents at december  were unrestricted and held for working capital purposes 
they were invested primarily in money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
fluctuations vary depending on cash collections  client mix and the volume of monthly usage of our service 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on an annual basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  divided by revenues for the most recent year  multiplied by b the number of days in the year 
our dso was days at december   days at december  and days at december  requirements capital expenditures in recent years  we have made capital expenditures primarily to acquire computer hardware and software and  to a lesser extent  furniture and leasehold improvements  to support the growth of our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  would reduce future investment income 
a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates would result in a  decrease in annualized interest income assuming a constant balance outstanding of million in cash and cash equivalents
