item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand choice hotels international  inc and its subsidiaries 
md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
overview we are a hotel franchisor with franchise agreements representing  hotels open and  hotels under construction  awaiting conversion or approved for development as of december   with  rooms and  rooms  respectively  in states  the district of columbia and over countries and territories outside the united states 
our brand names include comfort inn  comfort suites  quality  clarion  ascend collection  sleep inn  econo lodge  rodeway inn  mainstay suites  suburban extended stay hotel and cambria suites collectively  the choice brands 

table of contents the company conducts its international franchise operations through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising relationships which allow the use of our brands by third parties in foreign countries 
the company has made equity investments in certain non domestic lodging franchise companies that conduct franchise operations for the choice brands under master franchising relationships 
as a result of our use of master franchising relationships and international market conditions  total revenues from international franchising operations comprised only and of our total revenues in and  respectively while representing approximately and of our franchise system hotels open at december  and  respectively 
on january   the company terminated the master franchise agreement with the real hotel company plc rhc related to rhc s franchised hotels under the choice brands in the united kingdom 
in conjunction with the termination of the master franchise agreement  the company acquired rhc s franchise contracts under the master franchise agreement and commenced direct franchising operations in the united kingdom on this date 
during  the company acquired of the stock of choice hotels franchise gmbh chg 
chg was a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the company s master franchisees  rhc 
under the master franchise agreement with rhc  chg franchised hotels under the company s brands in austria  germany  italy  czech republic and portions of switzerland 
as a result of this acquisition  the master franchise agreement between the company and rhc covering these countries terminated 
the results of chg have been consolidated with the company since october  during  the company acquired rhc s assets  including franchise contracts  related to its franchising of hotels under the company s brands in france  belgium  portugal  spain and portions of switzerland 
as a result of this acquisition  the master franchise agreement between the company and rhc covering these countries terminated and the company commenced direct franchising operations in these countries on november  these transactions enable choice to continue its strategy of more closely directing the growth of our franchise operations throughout continental europe and the united kingdom 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows primarily from initial and continuing royalty fees attributable to our franchise agreements 
revenues are also generated from procurement services vendor arrangements  hotel operations and other sources 
the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
for most hotels  demand is lower in december through march than during the remainder of the year 
our principal source of revenues is franchise fees based on the gross room revenues of our franchised properties 
the company s franchise fee revenues and operating income reflect the industry s seasonality and historically have been lower in the first quarter than in the second  third or fourth quarters 
with a focus on hotel franchising instead of ownership  we benefit from the economies of scale inherent in the franchising business 
the fee and cost structure of our business provides opportunities to improve operating results by increasing the number of franchised hotel rooms and effective royalty rates of our franchise contracts resulting in increased initial fee revenue  ongoing royalty fees and procurement services revenues 
in addition  our operating results can also be improved through our company wide efforts related to improving property level performance 
at december   the company estimates that based on its current domestic portfolio of hotels under franchise that a change in revenue per available room revpar or rooms under franchise would increase or decrease royalty revenues by approximately million and a basis point change in the company s effective royalty rate would increase or decrease domestic royalties by approximately million 
in addition to these revenues  we also collect marketing and reservation system fees to support centralized marketing and reservation activities for the franchise system 
as a lodging franchisor  choice currently has relatively low capital expenditure requirements 

table of contents the principal factors that affect the company s results are the number and relative mix of franchised hotel rooms  growth in the number of hotel rooms under franchise  occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels under franchise  the effective royalty rate achieved  and our ability to manage costs 
the number of rooms at franchised properties and occupancy and room rates at those properties significantly affect the company s results because our fees are based upon room revenues at franchised hotels 
the key industry standard for measuring hotel operating performance is revpar  which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate realized 
our variable overhead costs associated with franchise system growth have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises 
accordingly  continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve operating results 
we are contractually required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation system fees we collect for system wide marketing and reservation activities 
these expenditures  which include advertising costs and costs to maintain our central reservations system  help to enhance awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands 
greater awareness and preference promotes long term growth in business delivery to our franchisees  which ultimately increases franchise fees earned by the company 
our company articulates its mission as a commitment to our customers profitability by providing our customers with hotel franchises that generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise 
we have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees success that focuses on delivering guests to our franchised hotels and reducing costs for our hotel owners 
we believe that executing our strategic priorities creates value 
our company focuses on two key value drivers profitable growth 
our success is dependent on improving the performance of our hotels  increasing our system size by selling additional hotel franchises and effective royalty rate improvement 
we attempt to improve our franchisees revenues and overall profitability by providing a variety of products and services designed to increase business delivery to and or reduce operating and development costs for our franchisees 
these products and services include national marketing campaigns  a central reservation system  property and yield management systems  quality assurance standards and procurement services vendor relationships 
we believe that healthy brands  which deliver a compelling return on investment for franchisees  will enable us to sell additional hotel franchises and raise royalty rates 
we have established multiple brands that meet the needs of many types of guests  and can be developed at various price points and applied to both new and existing hotels 
this ensures that we have brands suitable for creating growth in a variety of market conditions 
improving the performance of the hotels under franchise  growing the system through additional franchise sales and improving franchise agreement pricing while maintaining a disciplined cost structure are the keys to profitable growth 
maximizing financial returns and creating value for shareholders 
our capital allocation decisions  including capital structure and uses of capital  are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders 
we believe our strong and predictable cash flows create a strong financial position that provides us a competitive advantage 
currently  our business does not require significant capital to operate and grow 
therefore  we can maintain a capital structure that generates high financial returns and use our excess cash flow to increase returns to our shareholders 
historically  we have returned value to our shareholders in two primary ways share repurchases and dividends 
in  we instituted a share repurchase program which has generated substantial value for our shareholders 
through december   we have repurchased million shares including million prior to the two for one stock split effected in october of common stock at a total cost of million since the program s inception 
considering the effect of the two for one stock split  the company has repurchased million shares at an average price of per share 
on december   the board of directors authorized a five million share increase in the number of shares available for repurchase under the program 
at december   the company had remaining authorization to purchase up to million shares under the current stock repurchase authorization of the board of directors 
upon 
table of contents completion of the current authorization  our board of directors will evaluate the propriety of additional share repurchases 
in  we paid cash dividends totaling approximately million and we presently expect to continue to pay dividends in the future 
based on our present dividend rate and outstanding share count  aggregate annual dividends for would be approximately million 
our board of directors has authorized us to enter into programs which permit us to offer investment  financing and guaranty support to qualified franchisees to incent multi unit franchise development in top markets primarily for the company s cambria suites and extended stay brands 
based on market and other conditions  we expect to deploy this capital opportunistically over the next several years 
in addition to these programs  the company expects to continue to return value to its shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends  subject to market and other conditions 
we believe these value drivers  when properly implemented  will enhance our profitability  maximize our financial returns and continue to generate value for our shareholders 
the ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in the items below 
results of operation royalty fees  operating income  net income and diluted earnings per share eps represent key measurements of these value drivers 
in  royalty fees revenue totaled approximately million  a increase compared to operating income totaled million for the year ended december   a decline from net income for the year ended december  declined million from to million and diluted earnings per share were  a decline from operating and net income include expenses related to the acceleration of the company s management succession plan totaling million million  net of tax  termination benefits for non executive employees totaling million million  net of tax and the establishment of reserves for impaired notes receivable totaling million million  net of tax 
these items represented diluted eps of 
these measurements will continue to be a key management focus in and beyond 
refer to md a heading operations review for additional analysis of our results 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company has generated significant cash flows from operations 
in and  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million  respectively 
since our business does not currently require significant reinvestment of capital  we utilize cash in ways that management believes provide the greatest returns to our shareholders which include share repurchases and dividends 
we believe the company s cash flow from operations and available financing capacity is sufficient to meet the expected future operating  investing and financing needs of the business 
however  events over the past several months  including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies have made the capital markets increasingly volatile 
as a result of the dislocation in the credit markets  the availability of reasonably priced credit may be limited and therefore reduce the company s ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and its share repurchase program 
refer to md a heading liquidity and capital resources for additional analysis 
inflation inflation has been moderate in recent years and has not had a significant impact on our business 
operations review comparison of operating results and operating results the company recorded net income of million for the year ended december   an million or decline from million for the year ended december  the decline in net income for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a million or decline in operating income and the decline in the fair value of investments held in the company s non qualified employee benefit plans

based on the uncertainty around the current economic and credit market conditions and the volume of franchise applications received by the company in the fourth quarter of  we expect the number of applications received and therefore the number of new franchise agreements executed to again decline in we believe this trend is likely to continue while the lodging industry experiences negative operating conditions and the availability of hotel financing continues to be limited 
during prior lodging industry down turns  the company has experienced an increase in the number of new domestic franchise agreements from conversion hotels

our board of directors has authorized us to enter into programs which permit us to offer investment  financing and guaranty support to qualified franchisees to incent multi unit franchise development in top markets primarily for the company s cambria suites and extended stay brands 
we expect to deploy this capital opportunistically over the next several years 
the company previously announced that depending on market and other conditions  our expectation was that our annual investment in these programs would range from million to million 
however  based on current market conditions  the company does not expect to deploy a significant portion of this capital until market and economic conditions improve 
in addition to these programs  the company expects to continue to return value to its shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends  subject to market and other conditions

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest and penalties totaled million at december  and is not reflected in the contractual obligations table 
we have several open tax positions  and it is possible that the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits could change over the next year 
while it is possible that one or more of these open positions may be resolved in the next year  it is not anticipated that a significant impact to the unrecognized tax benefit balance will occur 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and available financing capacity are adequate to meet the expected future operating  investing and financing needs of the business 
however  events over the past several months  including recent failures and near failures of a number of large financial service companies have made the capital markets increasingly volatile 
as a result of the dislocation in the credit markets  the availability of reasonably priced credit may be limited and therefore reduce the company s ability to return value to shareholders through dividends and its share repurchase program

table of contents critical accounting policies our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have described below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment or significant estimates in their application 
additional discussion of these policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company accounts for initial  relicensing and continuing franchise fees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for franchise fee revenue 
we recognize continuing franchise fees  including royalty  marketing and reservations system fees  when earned and receivable from our franchisees 
franchise fees are typically based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchisee 
our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible royalty fees is charged to sg a expense 
the company may also enter into master development agreements mdas with developers that grant limited exclusive development rights and preferential franchise agreement terms for one time  non refundable fees 
when these fees are not contingent upon the number of agreements executed under the mda  the company accounts for these up front fees in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
and recognizes the up front fees over the mdas contractual life 
initial franchise and relicensing fees are recognized  in most instances  in the period the related franchise agreement is executed because the initial franchise and relicensing fees are non refundable and the company is not required to provide initial services to the franchisee prior to hotel opening 
we defer the initial franchise and relicensing fee revenue related to franchise agreements which include incentives until the incentive criteria are met or the agreement is terminated  whichever occurs first 
we account for procurement services revenues from qualified vendors in accordance with sab and emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
pursuant to sab  the company recognizes procurement services revenues when the services are performed or the product delivered  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we defer the recognition of procurement services revenues related to certain upfront fees and recognize them over a period corresponding to the company s estimate of the life of the arrangement 
marketing and reservation revenues and expenses 
the company records marketing and reservation revenues and expenses in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues and expenses be recorded gross 
in addition  net advances to and repayments from the franchise system for marketing and reservation activities are presented as cash flows from operating activities 
reservation fees and marketing fees not expended in the current year are carried over to the next fiscal year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements 
shortfall amounts are similarly recovered in subsequent years 
cumulative excess or shortfall amounts from the operation of these programs are recorded as a marketing or reservation fee payable or receivable 
under the terms of the franchise agreements  the company may advance capital as necessary for marketing and reservation activities and recover such advances through future fees 
our current assessment is that the credit risk associated with the marketing fee receivable is mitigated due to our contractual right to recover these amounts from a large geographically dispersed group of franchisees 
choice privileges is our frequent guest incentive marketing program 
choice privileges enables members to earn points based on their spending levels at participating brands and  to a lesser degree  through participation in affiliated partners programs  such as those offered by credit card companies 
the points may be redeemed for free accommodations or other benefits 
points cannot be redeemed for cash 

table of contents the company collects a percentage of program members room revenue from participating franchises 
revenues are deferred in an amount equal to the fair value of the future redemption obligation 
a third party actuary estimates the eventual redemption rates and point values using various actuarial methods 
these judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points 
upon redemption of points  the company recognizes the previously deferred revenue as well as the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed 
revenues in excess of the estimated future redemption obligation are recognized when earned to reimburse the company for costs incurred to operate the program  including administrative costs  marketing  promotion and performing member services 
costs to operate the program  excluding estimated redemption values  are expensed when incurred 
impairment policy 
we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis  or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of our net assets with the carrying amount of goodwill 
because the company has one reporting unit  the market capitalization of the company is used to determine if goodwill may be impaired 
the company did not record any impairment of goodwill during the years ended december   and we evaluate the potential impairment of property and equipment and other long lived assets  including franchise rights on an annual basis or whenever an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the asset 
our evaluation is based upon future cash flow projections 
significant management judgment is involved in developing these projections  and they include inherent uncertainties 
if different projections had been used in the current period  the balances for non current assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different projections or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
the company evaluates the collectibility of notes receivable on a periodic basis to determine when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
all amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest payments and the contractual principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement 
if the company concludes that it will be unable to collect all amounts due  the company will establish a specific impairment reserve based on the difference between the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  which may or may not occur  or the estimated fair value of the collateral and the recorded investment in the loan 
we apply our loan impairment policy individually to all loans in the portfolio and do not aggregate loans for the purpose of applying such policy 
where we determine that a loan is impaired  we recognize interest income on a cash basis 
during the year ended december   the company determined that certain outstanding notes receivable were impaired and therefore recorded an additional reserve of million against these notes receivable in sg a expenses for a total of million 
the company determined the fair value of these impaired assets based on its estimates of the fair value of loan collateral pledged in support of these outstanding notes receivable 
the expected cash flows from this collateral were discounted based on an effective interest rate as per the loan agreements of 
assumptions in estimating expected future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we make every effort to forecast these future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed 
however  changes in the assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the notes receivable and could result in additional impairment reserves in future periods 
stock compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or 
table of contents liability instruments issued 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method and began applying its provisions to i new awards  ii awards modified subsequent to the adoption date and iii outstanding awards for which all requisite service had not yet been rendered 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation costs were recognized on the unvested portion of awards beginning on january  based on the grant date fair value used for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure over the remaining vesting period 
compensation expense related to the fair value of share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period based on an estimate of those awards that will ultimately vest 
the company estimates the share based compensation expense for awards that will ultimately vest upon inception of the grant and adjusts the estimate of share based compensation for those awards with performance and or service requirements that will not be satisfied so that compensation cost is recognized only for awards that ultimately vest 
income taxes 
our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments 
judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets and the ultimate outcome of tax related contingencies represent key items involved in the determination of income tax expense and related balance sheet accounts 
the company does not provide additional united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries included in retained earnings 
such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation 
the company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries 
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
realization of our deferred tax assets reflects our tax planning strategies 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we do not believe will be realized 
tax assessments and resolution of tax contingencies may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
predicting the outcome of such tax assessments involves uncertainty  however  we believe that recorded tax liabilities adequately account for our analysis of probable outcomes

additions of million represented unrecognized tax benefits for current year tax positions related to state taxes 
reductions of million were due to changes in judgment and lapse of applicable statutes of limitations related to state tax positions and stock based compensation deductions 
the company believes it is reasonably possible it will recognize tax benefits of up to million within the next twelve months 
this is due to the anticipated lapse of applicable statutes of limitations regarding state tax positions and stock based compensation deductions 
the company s uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions
