item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents acquisition and development strategy we seek to acquire high quality  well designed and well located properties  with a focus on off campus garden style communities with modern floor plans and amenities 
our ideal acquisition targets generally are located in markets that have stable or increasing student populations and an insufficient supply of student housing 
we also seek to acquire investments in student housing communities that possess sound market fundamentals but are under performing and would benefit from re positioning  renovation and or improved property management 
we consider the following property and market factors to identify potential property acquisitions university and campus reputation  competitive admissions criteria  limited number of on campus beds and limited plans for expansion  distance of property from campus  property unit mix  competition  significant out of state enrollment  past operating performance  potential for improved management  ownership and capital structure  presence of desired amenities  maintenance and condition of the property  access to a university sponsored or public transportation line  and parking availability 
utilizing joint venture agreements  we hold a minority ownership interest in properties and earn a fee for the management of the properties 
this strategy enables us to accretively diversify our portfolio by expanding into geographic markets where we are not currently present with lower capital requirements than if we acquired the properties on our own 
we expect to continue pursuing joint venture arrangements in the future 
in  the development and construction of university village in greensboro  north carolina was completed under a joint venture arrangement 
also in  we acquired land in carbondale  illinois and began construction on a student housing community near southern illinois university 
this represents the first community edr is developing and building for its own ownership since becoming a public company 
in  we completed the development of the first phase of the property and it opened in august of we also began development on the second phase which is scheduled to open in august of in  we also began development of a wholly owned student housing community located on the campus of syracuse university in syracuse  new york 
the trust will own and manage the community under a long term ground lease from syracuse university 
operating strategy we seek to maximize funds from the operations of the student housing communities that we own and manage through the following operational strategies 
maximize property profitability 
we seek to maximize property level profitability through the use of cost control systems and our focused on site management personnel 
some of our specific cost control initiatives include establishing internal controls and procedures for cost control consistently throughout our communities  operating with flat property level management structures  minimizing multiple layers of management  and negotiating service level pricing arrangements with national and regional vendors and requiring corporate level approval of service agreements for each community 

table of contents proactive marketing practices 
we have developed and implemented proactive marketing practices to enhance the visibility of our student housing communities and to optimize our occupancy rates 
we study our competitors  our residents and university policies affecting enrollment and housing 
based on our findings at each property  we formulate a marketing and sales plan for each academic leasing period 
this plan is closely monitored and adjusted  if need be  throughout the leasing period 
we intend to continue to market our properties to students  parents and universities by emphasizing student oriented living areas  state of the art technology infrastructure  a wide variety of amenities and services and close proximity to the campus 
develop and retain personnel 
we staff each student housing community that we own or manage with a full service on site property management team 
each of our property management teams includes community assistants who plan activities and interact with students  enhancing their college experiences 
we have developed policies and procedures to train each team of on site employees and to provide them with corporate based support for each essential operating function 
to retain employees  we have developed an incentive based compensation structure that is available to all of our on site personnel 
maintain and develop strategic relationships 
we believe that establishing and maintaining relationships with universities is important to the ongoing success of our business 
we believe that these relationships will continue to provide us with referrals that enhance our leasing efforts  opportunities for additional acquisitions of student housing communities and contracts for third party services 
third party services in addition to managing our owned student housing communities and developing communities for our ownership  we also provide management and development consulting services for third parties 
universities and other third party owners look to the private sector for assistance in developing and managing their student housing properties 
we perform third party services in order to enhance our reputation with universities and to benefit our primary goal of owning high quality student housing communities 
we perform third party services for student housing communities serving some of the nation s most prominent systems of higher education  including the university of north carolina  the california state university system  the pennsylvania state system of higher education and the university of alabama system 
in order to comply with the rules applicable to our status as a reit  we provide our third party services through our management company and our development company 
unlike the income earned from our properties under the reit  the income earned by our management company and our development company is subject to regular federal income tax and state and local income taxes where applicable 
third party management services we provide third party management services for student housing communities owned by educational institutions  charitable foundations and others 
our management services typically cover all aspects of operations  including residence life and student development  marketing  leasing administration  strategic relationships  information systems and accounting services 
these services are comparable to the services that we provide for our owned properties 
we typically provide these services pursuant to multi year management contracts that have an initial term between three and ten years 
we believe that providing these services allows us to increase cash flow with little incremental cost by leveraging our existing management expertise and infrastructure 
for the year ended december   our fees from third party management services  excluding operating expense reimbursements represented of our revenues

in april of  an additional beds and units are scheduled to open and are included in the total number of beds and units above 
third party development consulting services we provide third party development consulting services primarily to universities seeking to modernize their on campus student housing communities but also to other third party investors 
our development consulting services typically include the following market analysis and evaluation of housing needs and options  cooperation with university in architectural design  negotiation of ground lease  development agreement  construction contract  architectural contract and bond documents  oversight of architectural design process  coordination of governmental and university plan approvals  oversight of construction process  design  purchase and installation of furniture  pre opening marketing to students  and obtaining final approvals of construction 
by providing these services  we are able to observe emerging trends in student housing development and market acceptance of unit and community amenities 
our development consulting services also provide us with opportunities to obtain additional third party property management contracts 
of the student housing communities we have provided development consulting services to since  the property owners have awarded us third party management services contracts for with universities electing to manage the communities in house under their existing infrastructure 
in  our fees from third party development consulting services  excluding operating expense reimbursements  represented of our revenues 

table of contents since  we have provided third party development consulting services to clients for projects totaling over billion in value 
we are currently providing third party development services pursuant to signed definitive contracts with projects under construction at indiana university of pennsylvania  west chester university of pennsylvania  colorado state university pueblo and to third parties near the university of michigan  ann arbor and the university of california santa barbara 
the aggregate project cost of these five projects is approximately  additionally  we are providing pre construction development consulting services on new projects and additional projects pursuant to signed pre closing development contracts at east stroudsburg university of pennsylvania  state university of new york college of environmental services and forestry  indiana university of pennsylvania and colorado state university pueblo 
in aggregate  these total approximately  in project costs 
we typically are notified that we have been awarded development consulting services projects on the basis of a competitive award process and thereafter begin to work on the project 
in the case of tax exempt bond financed projects  definitive contracts are not executed until bond closing 
our operations we staff each of our owned and managed student housing communities with a full service property management team 
we typically staff each property with one community manager  a marketing leasing manager  a student accounts manager  a resident services director  a maintenance supervisor  one on site resident community assistant for each students and general office staff 
each property management team markets  leases and manages the community with a focus on maximizing its profitability 
in addition  each property management team is trained to provide social and developmental opportunities for students  enhancing the students college experiences as well as the desirability of our communities 
we have developed policies and procedures to carefully select and develop each team of on site employees and to provide each team with corporate based support for each essential operating area  including lease administration  sales marketing  community and university relations  student life administration  maintenance and loss prevention  accounting  human resources benefits administration and information systems 
the corporate level personnel responsible for each of these areas support each community manager s leadership role  and are available as a resource to the community managers around the clock 
residence life and student development our corporate director of residence life and student personnel development designs and directs our residence life program 
our programs are developed at the corporate level and implemented at each community by our community assistants  together with our other on site personnel 
we provide educational  social and recreational activities designed to help students achieve academic goals  promote respect and harmony throughout the community  and help bridge interaction with the respective university 
examples of our residence life and student development programs include community building and social activities geared to university related events  holidays  public safety and education  study and attention skills counseling  career development  resume writing and employment search skill training  sponsorship of intramural sport teams  academic clubs and alumni based activities  parent and resident appreciation events  community service activities including recycling  blood drives  food drives and student volunteer committees  lectures focused on social issues  including effective communication  multi cultural awareness and substance abuse  university outreach activities  and voter registration  enrollment and education 
the community assistants perform key roles in the administrative functioning of the community and interface with students through constructive programs  activities and listening to student interests and concerns 
our on site leadership selects students to serve as community assistants who meet criteria established by our corporate director of residence life and student personnel development 

table of contents marketing we begin our annual marketing campaign by thoroughly segmenting the student population attending each of the primary universities where our student housing communities are located  and compiling market surveys of comparable student apartment properties 
with this information in hand  we formulate a marketing sales strategy that consists of a renewal campaign for current residents and a broader campaign directed at the eligible student population 
we assess university regulations regarding housing requirements to avoid targeting markets in which significant numbers of students are not eligible to live off campus until they achieve certain credit hour levels 
we typically begin our renewal campaign between november and january of each year 
signage  direct mailings to the students and their parents  appreciation parties and staff selling incentives are key elements of the renewal campaign 
the community assistant team plays a key role in communicating the renewal message throughout their assigned property area 
we use a database of current resident demographic data to direct sales information to primary feeder high schools  particularly where new freshmen are eligible to live off campus 
other database criteria include gender  high school location  prior apartment community  academic class standing  field of study and activity preferences 
we appeal to the greater university population through theme based newspaper advertising campaigns  open house activities  housing fairs conducted by the university  and web based advertising 
our community assistant staff targets certain university sponsored on campus events to distribute handouts displaying our logo and offering incentives to visit our sales center 
wherever possible  our student housing communities appear on university websites in listings of off campus housing options  together with banner advertising where available 
leasing our standard lease begins in august and runs for approximately months  ending july or early august to coincide with the university s fall academic term 
the primary exception to our standard lease term is our university towers community  which we generally rent on nine month academic year leases 
our standard lease is an agreement between the student and parental guarantor  and the specific student housing community 
all leases are for a bed in a private or shared bedroom  with rights to share common areas within the unit and throughout the community 
the individual lease is a strong selling attraction as it limits a student s liability to the rental for one bedroom instead of burdening the student with shared liability for the entire unit rental amount 
we lease our units by floor plan type using internally generated occupancy spreadsheets to maximize full leasing of entire units  avoiding spotty vacancies particularly in the four bedroom units 
we offer roommate matching services to facilitate full occupancy 
we develop wait lists and monitor popular floor plans that fill to capacity early in the leasing season 
if any fully vacant units remain available after the beginning of any academic semester  we seek to lease such units on a temporary basis to university related visitors and our tenants parents and family members  or keep them available for future leasing to students 
unlike conventional apartment communities that have monthly move outs and renewals  our student housing community occupancies remain relatively stable throughout the academic year  but must be entirely re leased at the beginning of each academic year 
because of the nature of leasing to students  we are highly dependent upon the success of our marketing and leasing efforts during the annual leasing season  generally november through august 
our leasing staff undergoes intensive annual professional training to maximize the success of our leasing efforts 
we typically require rent to be paid in equal monthly payments throughout the lease term  with the first installment due on july residents of university towers and residence halls that we manage for third parties typically pay their annual rent in two installments on july and december we replace contracted students who fail to pay the first installment with students on our waiting list or from walk in traffic while the market is still active with students seeking housing at the commencement of the academic year 
strategic relationships we assign high priority to establishing and nurturing relationships with the administration of each of the primary universities where our student housing communities are located 
our corporate staff establishes this network  and on site management then sustains it with follow up by corporate staff during routine visits to the community 
as a result of our strategic relationships  universities often refer their students to our properties  thus enhancing our leasing effort throughout the year 
these networks create goodwill for our student housing communities throughout the university administration  including departments of admissions  student affairs  public safety  athletics and international affairs 

table of contents most universities promote off campus housing alternatives to their student population 
it is our intention to be among the most preferred off campus residences and for universities to include our communities in listings and literature provided to students 
we seek to obtain student mailing lists and to be featured in internet based student housing listings wherever permitted by the institution and incorporate these initiatives into our marketing efforts 
our community managers make scheduled personal visits with academic departments to further our community exposure at this level 
our management team has developed long standing relationships with developers  owners and brokers of student housing properties that allow us to identify and capitalize on acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we have generated an internal database of contacts that we use to identify and evaluate acquisition candidates 
as it is our intention to develop a diverse portfolio of student housing communities  we also develop strategic relationships with equity investors in order to pursue acquisitions through joint venture arrangements 
acquisitions  through joint venture arrangements  allow us to obtain a minority interest in student housing communities in geographic markets where we are not currently present with less capital than if we acquired the properties on our own 
competition competition from universities we compete for student tenants with the owners of on campus student housing  which is generally owned by educational institutions or charitable foundations 
educational institutions can generally avoid real estate taxes and borrow funds at lower interest rates  while we and other private sector operators pay full real estate tax rates and have higher borrowing costs 
the competitive advantages of on campus student housing also include its physical proximity to the university campus and captive student body 
many universities have policies requiring students to live in their on campus facilities during their freshman year 
on campus housing is limited  however  and most universities are able to house only a small percentage of their students 
as a result  educational institutions depend upon  and may serve as referral sources for  private providers of off campus housing 
in addition  off campus housing facilities tend to offer more relaxed rules and regulations than on campus properties and therefore tend to be more appealing to students 
off campus student housing offers freedom from restrictions such as quiet hours or gender visitation limitations  and is especially appealing to upperclassmen who are transitioning towards their independence 
competition from private owners we compete with several regional and national owner operators of off campus student housing  including one publicly traded competitor  american campus communities  inc acc 
we also compete with privately held developers and other real estate firms and in a number of markets with smaller local owner operators 
currently  the industry is fragmented with no participant holding a dominant market share 
we believe that a number of other large national companies with substantial financial resources may be potential entrants in the student housing business 
the entry of one or more of these companies could increase competition for students and for the acquisition  management and development of student housing properties 
employees at december   we had approximately  employees  including  on site employees  including community assistants  people in our property management services department  people in our development consulting services department  and executive  corporate administration and financial personnel 

table of contents our senior management team has over years of collective experience working together in the student housing business 
our management team s in depth knowledge of the student housing industry results from hands on experiences

risk factors 
risks related to our properties  our business and the real estate industry adverse macroeconomic and business conditions may significantly and negatively affect our cash flows  profitability and results of operations 
the united states is currently in a deep recession that has resulted in higher unemployment  weakening of tenant financial condition  large scale business failures and tight credit markets 
our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact tenant leasing practices 
a continuation of ongoing adverse economic conditions affecting disposable tenant income  such as employment levels  business conditions  interest rates  tax rates  fuel and energy costs and other matters  could reduce overall tenant leasing or cause tenants to shift their leasing practices 
at this time  it is difficult to determine the breadth and duration of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our tenants and our business in general 
a general reduction in the level of tenant leasing could adversely affect our growth and profitability 
we own  directly or indirectly  interests in student housing communities located near major universities in the united states 
accordingly  we are dependant upon the levels of student enrollment and the admission policies of the respective universities which attract a significant portion of our leasing base 
as a result of the overall market quality deterioration  many students may be unable to obtain student loans on favorable terms 
if student loans are not available or their costs are prohibitively high  enrollment numbers for universities may decrease 
the demand for  occupancy rates at  rental income from and value of our properties would be adversely affected if student enrollment levels become stagnant or decrease in the current environment 
accordingly  a continuation or further worsening of these difficult financial and macroeconomic conditions could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows  profitability and results of operations 
our results of operations are subject to the following risks inherent in the student housing industry annual leasing cycle  concentrated lease up period  seasonal cash flows and increased risk of student defaults during the summer months of a twelve month lease 
we generally lease our properties under month leases  but we may also lease for terms of nine months or less 
furthermore  all of our properties must be entirely re leased each year  exposing us to increased leasing risk 
we may not be able to relet the property on similar terms  if we are able to relet the property at all 
the terms of renewal or re lease including the cost of required renovations and or concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than the prior lease 
if we are unable to relet all or a substantial portion of our properties  or if the rental rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected rates  our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness could be adversely affected 
in addition  we are subject to increased leasing risk on properties that we acquire that we have not previously managed due to our lack of experience leasing those properties and unfamiliarity with their leasing cycles 
student housing communities are typically leased during a leasing season that begins in november and ends in august of each year 
we are therefore highly dependent on the effectiveness of our marketing and leasing efforts and personnel during this season 
prior to the commencement of each new lease period  mostly during the first two weeks of august but also during september at some communities  we prepare the units for new incoming tenants 
other than revenue generated by in place leases for returning tenants  we do not generally recognize lease revenue during this period referred to as turn as we have no leases in place 
in addition  during turn  we incur significant expenses making our units ready for occupancy  which we recognize immediately 
this lease turn period results in seasonality in our operating results during the third quarter of each year 
as a result  we may experience significantly reduced cash flows during the summer months at properties leased for terms shorter than twelve months 
in addition  students leasing under twelve month leases may be more likely to default on their rental payments during the summer months 
although we typically require a student s parents to guarantee the student s lease  we may have to spend considerable effort and expense in pursuing payment upon a defaulted lease  and our efforts may not be successful 

table of contents broad market fluctuations could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
as with other publicly traded equity securities  the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions  which may change from time to time 
the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that are outside of management s control 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely impact the market price of our common stock 
accordingly  the market price of our common stock could change in ways that may or may not be related to our business  our industry or our operating performance and financial condition 
furthermore  our operating results and prospects may not meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors or may not be comparable to companies within our industry and with comparable market capitalizations 
any of these factors could lead to a material decline in the market price of our common stock 
our use of debt financing reduces cash available for distribution and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations 
our charter and bylaws impose no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur 
our debt service obligations expose us to the risk of default and reduce or eliminate cash resources that are available to operate our business 
we have an amended and restated revolving credit facility the amended revolver that contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and provides for potential availability of  the amount available to us and our ability to borrow from time to time under this facility is subject to certain conditions which include a borrowing base calculation that limits availability based on the underlying value of the collateral and the satisfaction of specified financial covenants  which include limiting distributions to our stockholders 
if the income generated by our properties and other assets fails to cover our debt service  we would be forced to reduce or eliminate distributions to our stockholders and may experience losses 
our level of debt and the operating limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences  including the following we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms  we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness  we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties  possibly on disadvantageous terms  we may default on our payment or other obligations as a result of insufficient cash flow or otherwise  and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases  we may cross default our amended revolver which would preclude further availability  and foreclosures could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  a circumstance that could hinder our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements 
we face significant competition from university owned student housing and from other private student housing communities located within close proximity to universities 
many students prefer on campus housing to off campus housing because of the closer physical proximity to campus and integration of on campus facilities into the academic community 
universities can generally avoid real estate taxes and borrow funds at lower interest rates  while we and other private sector operators pay full real estate tax rates and have higher borrowing costs 
consequently  universities often can offer more convenient and or less expensive student housing than we can  which can adversely affect our occupancy and rental rates 
we also compete with other national and regional owner operators of off campus student housing in a number of markets as well as with smaller local owner operators 
there are a number of purpose built student housing properties that compete directly with us located near or in the same general vicinity of many of our student housing communities 
such competing student housing communities may be newer than our student housing communities  located closer to campus  charge less rent  possess more attractive amenities  or offer more services  shorter lease terms or more flexible leases 
the construction of competing properties or decreases in the general levels of rents for housing in competing properties could adversely affect our rental income 
we believe that a number of other large national companies may be potential entrants in the student housing business 
in some cases  these potential competitors possess substantially greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
the entry of one or more of these companies could increase competition for student tenants and for the acquisition  development and management of other student housing communities 

table of contents we may not be able to recover our costs for our development consulting services 
we typically are awarded development consulting services business on the basis of a competitive award process  but definitive contracts are typically not executed until the formal approval of the transaction by the institution s governing body at the completion of the process 
in the intervening period  we may incur significant predevelopment and other costs in the expectation that the development consulting services contract will be executed 
these costs could range up to  or more per project and typically include architects fees to design the property and contractors fees to price the construction 
we typically seek to enter into a reimbursement agreement with the institution that requires the institution to provide a guarantee of our advances 
however  we may not be successful in negotiating such an agreement 
in addition  if an institution s governing body does not ultimately approve our selection and the underlying terms of a pending development  we may not be able to recover these costs from the institution 
in addition  when we are awarded development consulting business  we generally receive of our fees at the time the project is financed  and the remainder is generally paid in monthly installments thereafter 
as a result  the recognition and timing of revenues will  among other things differ from the timing of payments and be contingent upon the project owner s successful structuring and closing of the project financing as well as the timing of construction 
we may not be able to recover internal development costs 
when developing student housing communities for our ownership on university land  definitive contracts are not executed until the formal approval of the transaction by the institution s governing body at the completion of the process 
in the intervening period  we may incur significant predevelopment and other costs in the expectation that a ground lease will be executed 
these costs could range up to  or more and typically include architects fees to design the property and third party fees related to other predevelopment services 
if an institution s governing body does not ultimately approve the lease we will not be able to recover these predevelopment costs 
we may be unable to take advantage of certain disposition opportunities because of additional costs we have agreed to pay if we sell certain of our properties in taxable transactions for a period of five years 
under the terms of the purchase agreement with place properties  the trust remains a party to a tax indemnification agreement whereby a payment could be required to be made to the former owner if any properties are sold within five years of the purchase date 
the contingency expires in january of we also issued university towers partnership units for our interest in university towers 
so long as the contributing owners of such property hold at least of the university towers partnership units  we have agreed to maintain certain minimum amounts of debt on the properties so as to avoid triggering gain to the contributing owners 
if we fail to do this  we will owe to the contributing owners the amount of taxes that they incur 
in each case  the amount of tax is computed assuming the highest federal and state rates 
as a result  these agreements may preclude us from selling the restricted properties at the optimal time 
we rely on our relationships with universities  and changes in university personnel and or policies could adversely affect our operating results 
in some cases  we rely on our relationships with universities for referrals of prospective tenants or for mailing lists of prospective tenants and their parents 
the failure to maintain good relationships with personnel at these universities could therefore have a material adverse effect on us 
if universities refuse to make their lists of prospective student tenants and their parents available to us or increase the costs of these lists  the increased costs or failure to obtain such lists could also have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be adversely affected by a change in university admission policies 
for example  if a university reduces the number of student admissions  the demand for our properties may be reduced and our occupancy rates may decline 
in addition  universities may institute a policy that a certain class of students  such as freshmen  must live in a university owned facility  which would also reduce the demand for our properties 
while we may engage in marketing efforts to compensate for such policy changes  we may not be able to effect such marketing efforts prior to the commencement of the annual lease up period or at all 

table of contents our growth will be dependent upon our ability to acquire and or develop  lease  integrate and manage additional student housing communities successfully 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify real estate investments  including joint ventures  that meet our investment criteria  that we will be successful in completing any acquisition we identify or that any acquisition we complete will produce a return on our investment 
our future growth will be dependent upon our ability to successfully acquire new properties and enter into joint ventures on favorable terms  which may be adversely affected by the following significant risks we may be unable to acquire a desired property at all or at a desired purchase price because of competition from other purchasers of student housing  many of our future acquisitions are likely to be dependent on external financing  and we may be unable to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all  we may be required to incur significant capital expenditures to improve or renovate acquired properties  we may incur an increase in operating costs or may not have the proceeds available to implement renovations or improvements at existing properties which are necessary to attract and retain tenants  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions  particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties  into our existing operations  market conditions may result in higher than expected vacancy rates and lower than expected rental rates  and we may acquire properties subject to liabilities but without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  to the sellers  or with liabilities that are unknown to us  such as liabilities for undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by members  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
as we acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including lease up and integration risks 
newly acquired properties may not perform as expected  and newly acquired properties may have characteristics or deficiencies unknown to us at the time of acquisition 
our performance and the value of our real estate assets are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
our ability to make distributions to our stockholders depends on our ability to generate cash revenues in excess of expenses  scheduled debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements 
events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties 
these events include local oversupply of student housing units  increased competition or reduction in demand for student housing  inability to collect rent from tenants  vacancies or our inability to lease beds on favorable terms  inability to finance property development and acquisitions on favorable terms  increased operating costs  including insurance premiums  utilities  and real estate taxes  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments  changing student demographics  decreases in student enrollment at particular colleges and universities  changes in university policies related to admissions  national  regional and local economic conditions  and rising interest rates 

table of contents we will depend heavily on the availability of equity and debt capital to fund our business 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we are required under the internal revenue code of  as amended  which we refer to as the code  to distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to distributions paid and excluding any net capital gain 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our net taxable income  including any net capital gains  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws 
because of these distribution requirements  reits are largely unable to fund capital expenditures  such as acquisitions  renovations  development and property upgrades from operating cash flow 
consequently  we will be largely dependent on the public equity and debt capital markets and private lenders to provide capital to fund our growth and other capital expenditures 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or at all 
our access to equity and debt capital depends  in part  on general market conditions  our current debt levels and the number of properties subject to encumbrances  our current performance and the market s perception of our growth potential  our cash flow and cash distributions  and the market price per share of our common stock 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our stockholders  including those necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 
additional issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to stockholders 
the interests of our stockholders could be diluted if we issue additional equity securities to finance future developments or acquisitions or to repay indebtedness 
our board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional equity securities without stockholder approval 
our ability to execute our business strategy depends upon our access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including revolving credit facilities and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including the issuance of common equity 
we may reduce the amount of dividends declared on our common stock or elect to pay a portion of the dividend in shares of our common stock 
in order for edr to continue to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
however  in the event of  among other factors  continued material future deterioration in business conditions  or continuing tightening in the credit markets  our board of directors may decide to further reduce the amount of our dividend while ensuring compliance with the requirements of the code related to reit qualification 
additionally  in december  the irs announced it would treat a cash option share dividend as satisfying a public reit s distribution requirements for and so long as certain requirements are met 
we may elect to pay dividends during this period in part in shares of our common stock which would cause dilution to our earnings per share given the additional shares outstanding 
current market conditions could affect our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and may have other adverse effects on us 
the united states credit markets have recently experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions  including the bankruptcy  insolvency or restructuring of certain financial institutions 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms for borrowers less attractive  and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
our amended revolver is due to mature on march   however  the operating partnership has met the extension requirements and has exercised its option to extend the maturity date until march   under existing terms 
as of december   we had  outstanding under this facility with an additional  
table of contents available 
although we believe that our amended revolver is sufficient for our current operations  any reductions in our available borrowing capacity  or our inability to renew or replace this facility when required or when business conditions warrant  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase 
higher interest rates on newly incurred debt may negatively impact us as well 
if interest rates increase  our interest costs and overall costs of capital will increase  which could adversely affect our transaction and development activity  financial condition  results of operation  cash flow  the market price of our stock  our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
if we are unable to secure additional financing or refinancing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow is insufficient  we may not be able to satisfy our outstanding financial obligations under our mortgage and construction debt 
furthermore  if financing is not available when needed  or is available on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a prolonged downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  which such sources may not then be available  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly or significantly cutback or curtail operations and development plans 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 
in addition  we mortgage most of our properties to secure payment of indebtedness 
in   or  of our mortgage debt reaches maturity 
if we are unable to service the mortgages  including in the event we are not successful in refinancing our mortgage debt upon maturity  then the properties could be foreclosed upon or transferred to the mortgagee  or we might be forced to dispose of some of our properties on disadvantageous terms  with a consequent loss of income and asset value 
a foreclosure of mortgaged properties could cause a cross default on our amended revolver limiting its availability 
a foreclosure or disadvantageous disposal on one or more of our properties could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow and ability to pay dividends on  and the market price of  our stock 
our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 
we have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located or under development  and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases 
as the lessee under a ground lease  we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property or building we may be developing upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us 
we have limited time to perform due diligence on many of our acquired properties  which could subject us to significant unexpected liabilities and under performance of the acquired properties 
when we enter into an agreement to acquire a property  we often have limited time to complete our due diligence prior to acquiring the property 
because our internal resources are limited  we may rely on third parties to conduct a portion of our due diligence 
to the extent these third parties or we underestimate or fail to identify risks and liabilities associated with the properties we acquire  we may incur unexpected liabilities  or the property may fail to perform in accordance with our projections 
if  during the due diligence phase  we do not accurately assess the value of and liabilities associated with a particular property  we may pay a purchase price that exceeds the current fair value of the assets 
as a result  material goodwill and other intangible assets would be recorded  which could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods 
these charges  in addition to the financial impact of significant liabilities that we may assume  could seriously harm our financial and operating results  as well as our ability to pay dividends 

table of contents certain losses may not be covered by insurance or may be underinsured 
we carry insurance covering comprehensive liability  fire  earthquake  terrorism  business interruption  vandalism and malicious mischief  extended coverage perils  physical loss perils  commercial general liability  personal injury  workers compensation  business  automobile  errors and omissions  employee dishonesty  employment practices liability and rental loss with respect to all of the properties in our portfolio and the operation of our management company and development company 
we also carry insurance covering flood when the property is located in whole or in material part in a designated flood plain area on some of our properties 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss  the cost of the coverage and industry practice 
there are  however  certain types of losses such as property damage from riots or wars  employment discrimination losses  punitive damage awards  or acts of god that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
some of our policies are subject to large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses 
in addition  we may discontinue earthquake  terrorism or other insurance on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for these policies exceeds  in our judgment  the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss 
if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
future terrorist attacks in the united states could harm the demand for and the value of our student housing communities 
future terrorist attacks in the united states  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of terrorism or war  or threats of the same  could harm the demand for and the value of our properties 
a decrease in demand in our markets would make it difficult for us to renew or re lease our properties at rates equal to or above historical rates 
terrorist attacks also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage  destruction  loss or increased security costs  and the availability or cost of insurance for such acts 
if we receive casualty proceeds  we may not be able to reinvest such proceeds profitably or at all  and we may be forced to recognize taxable gain on the affected property 
we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and private litigation over environmental matters 
under various environmental laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for contamination resulting from the release or threatened release of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum at that property  and an entity that arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum at another property may be held jointly and severally liable for the cost to investigate and clean up such property or other affected property 
such parties are known as potentially responsible parties  or prps 
environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the contaminants  and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances can be substantial 
prps are liable to the government as well as to other prps who may have claims for contribution 
the liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party 
the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third party liability for personal injury or property damage  or adversely affect our ability to sell  lease or develop the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral 
we do not carry environmental insurance on any of the properties in our portfolio 
environmental laws also impose ongoing compliance requirements on owners and operators of real property 
environmental laws potentially affecting us address a wide variety of matters  including  but not limited to  asbestos containing building materials  storage tanks  storm water and wastewater discharges  lead based paint  wetlands and hazardous wastes 
failure to comply with these laws could result in fines and penalties and or expose us to third party liability 
some of our properties may have conditions that are subject to these requirements  and we could be liable for such fines or penalties and or liable to third parties for those conditions 

table of contents we could be exposed to liability and remedial costs related to environmental matters 
certain properties in our portfolio may contain  or may have contained  asbestos containing building materials  or acbms 
environmental laws require that acbms be properly managed and maintained  and may impose fines and penalties on building owners and operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
also  certain properties may contain  or may have contained  or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain storage tanks for the storage of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations create a potential for the release of petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
certain properties in our portfolio contain  or may have contained  elevated radon levels 
third parties may be permitted by law to seek recovery from owners or operators for property damage and or personal injury associated with exposure to contaminants  including  but not limited to  petroleum products  hazardous or toxic substances and asbestos fibers 
also  some of the properties may contain regulated wetlands that can delay or impede development or require costs to be incurred to mitigate the impact of any disturbance 
absent appropriate permits  we can be held responsible for restoring wetlands and be required to pay fines and penalties 
some of the properties in our portfolio may contain microbial matter such as mold and mildew 
the presence of microbial matter could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  if any property in our portfolio is not properly connected to a water or sewer system  or if the integrity of such systems are breached  or if water intrusion into our buildings otherwise occurs  microbial matter or other contamination can develop 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
if this were to occur  we could incur significant remedial costs and we may also be subject to material private damage claims and awards 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing  as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic or other reactions 
if we become subject to claims in this regard  it could materially and adversely affect us and our future insurability for such matters 
independent environmental consultants conduct phase i environmental site assessments on all of our acquisitions 
phase i environmental site assessments are intended to evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties based generally on visual observations  interviews and certain publicly available databases 
these assessments do not typically take into account all environmental issues including  but not limited to  testing of soil or groundwater or the possible presence of asbestos  lead based paint  radon  wetlands or mold 
the results of these assessments are addressed and could result in either a cancellation of the purchase  the requirement of the seller to remediate issues  or additional costs on our part to remediate the issue 
none of the previous site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would be material to us 
however  the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns 
material environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the assessments were conducted or may arise in the future  and future laws  ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability 
we cannot assure you that costs of future environmental compliance will not affect our ability to make distributions or that such costs or other remedial measures will not be material to us 
we may incur significant costs complying with the americans with disabilities act and similar laws 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or the ada  all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
additional federal  state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties  or restrict our ability to renovate our properties 
for example  the fair housing amendments act of  or fhaa  requires apartment properties first occupied after march  to be accessible to the handicapped 
we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with present ada requirements 
noncompliance with the ada or fhaa could result in the imposition of fines or an award for damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any non complying feature 
we cannot predict the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the ada  fhaa or other legislation 
if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada  fhaa or any other legislation  we could 
table of contents be materially and adversely affected 
in june  the united states department of justice  or doj  notified the previous owner of one of our properties of an on going investigation regarding possible violations of the ada and the fhaa 
the doj has reviewed the property plans for this property but has not issued a report regarding its review 
in october  the doj indicated that the investigations were being delayed for an undetermined period of time 
this investigation has not been resolved and  at this point  no conclusion can be reached regarding what will be required to conclude it or whether it will result in a dispute or legal proceedings with the doj 
noncompliance with the ada and the fhaa could result in the imposition of injunctive relief  fines  awards of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the doj s investigation 
we may incur significant costs complying with other regulations 
the properties in our portfolio are subject to various federal  state and local regulatory requirements  such as state and local fire and life safety requirements 
if we fail to comply with these various requirements  we might incur governmental fines or be liable for private action money damages 
furthermore  existing requirements could change and require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that would materially and adversely affect us 
joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on co venturers financial condition and disputes between our co venturers and us 
we have co invested and anticipate that we will continue to co invest with third parties through partnerships  joint ventures or other entities  acquiring non controlling interests in or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs of a property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
in such event  we will not have sole decision making authority regarding the property  partnership  joint venture or other entity 
investments in partnerships  joint ventures or other entities may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not present were a third party not involved  including the possibility that partners or co venturers may become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions 
partners or co venturers also may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our preferences  policies or objectives 
such investments also will have the potential risk of our reaching impasses with our partners or co venturers on key decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor the partner or co venturer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture 
disputes between us and partners or co venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our management team from focusing its time and effort exclusively on our business 
in addition  we may in some circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party partners or co venturers 
illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions is limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors  such as general economic conditions  availability of financing  interest rates and other factors  including supply and demand  that are beyond our control 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property 
we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold 
we cannot ensure that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements 
in acquiring a property  we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions  such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property 
these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate 

table of contents risks related to our organization and structure to maintain our reit status  we may be forced to limit the activities of our management company 
to maintain our status as a reit  no more than of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries  such as our management company 
some of our activities  such as our third party management  development consulting and food services  must be conducted through our management company and development company for us to maintain our reit qualification 
in addition  certain non customary services such as cleaning  transportation  security and  in some cases  parking  must be provided by a taxable reit subsidiary or an independent contractor 
if the revenues from such activities create a risk that the value of our management company  based on revenues or otherwise  approaches the threshold  we will be forced to curtail such activities or take other steps to remain under the threshold 
because the threshold is based on value  it is possible that the internal revenue service  or irs  could successfully contend that the value of our management company exceeds the threshold even if our management company accounts for less than of our consolidated revenues  income or cash flow  in which case our status as a reit could be jeopardized 
our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock 
our charter provides that  subject to certain exceptions  no person or entity may beneficially own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the code  more than by value  by number of shares or by voting power  whichever is more restrictive of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than by value  by number of shares or by voting power  whichever is more restrictive of all our outstanding shares  including both common and preferred stock 
we refer to this restriction as the ownership limit 
generally  if a beneficial owner of our shares exceeds the ownership limit  such owner will be effectively divested of all ownership rights with respect to shares exceeding the limit and may suffer a loss on his or her investment 
the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and or entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity 
as a result  the acquisition of less than of our stock or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns  actually or constructively  our stock by an individual or entity  could  nevertheless cause that individual or entity  or another individual or entity  to own constructively in excess of of our outstanding stock and thereby subject certain shares to the ramifications of exceeding the ownership limit 
our charter  however  permits exceptions to be made to this limitation if our board of directors determines that such exceptions will not jeopardize our tax status as a reit 
this ownership limit could delay  defer or prevent a change of control or other transaction that might otherwise result in a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
certain tax and anti takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 
certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us  or could delay  defer or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management 
these provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of common stock over then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include the reit ownership limit described above  authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers  preferences or rights to be determined by our board of directors  the right of our board of directors  without a stockholder vote  to increase our authorized shares and classify or reclassify unissued shares  and advance notice requirements for stockholder nomination of directors and for other proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings 
the maryland business statutes also impose potential restrictions on a change of control of our company 
various maryland laws may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us  even if the acquisition would be advantageous to our stockholders 
our bylaws exempt us from some of those laws  such as the control share acquisition provisions  but our board of directors can change our bylaws at any time to make these provisions applicable to us 

table of contents we have the right to change some of our policies that may be important to our stockholders without stockholder consent 
our major policies  including our policies with respect to investments  leverage  financing  growth  debt and capitalization  are determined by our board of directors or those committees or officers to whom our board of directors has delegated that authority 
our board of directors also establishes the amount of any distributions that we make to our stockholders 
our board of directors may amend or revise the foregoing policies  our distribution payment amounts and other policies from time to time without a stockholder vote 
accordingly  our stockholders may not have control over changes in our policies 
the ability of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 
our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election  without the approval of our stockholders  if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit 
if we cease to qualify as a reit  we would become subject to federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders  which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 
our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 
maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith  in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be advisable and in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances 
in addition  our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money  property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and that is material to the cause of action 
our bylaws require us to indemnify directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacitates to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law 
as a result  our stockholders and we may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 
in addition  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers 
our success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
we depend upon the services of our key personnel  particularly paul o 
bower  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  randall h 
brown  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  thomas trubiana  our chief investment officer  and craig l 
cardwell  our president of allen o hara education services  inc messrs 
bower  trubiana and cardwell each have been in the student housing business for over years  and each of them has developed a network of contacts and a reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with universities  lenders and industry personnel 
in addition  mr 
brown possesses detailed knowledge of and experience with our financial and ancillary support operations that are critical to our operations and financial reporting obligations as a public company 
we will continue to need to attract and retain qualified additional senior executive officers as we grow our business 
the loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers  or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
federal income tax risks failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock 
we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes under the code 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we qualify as a reit 
if we lose our reit status  we will face serious tax consequences that could substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income  and such amounts would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes  and unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions  we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

table of contents in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders  and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
as a result of all these factors  our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital  and would adversely affect the value of our common stock 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations 
the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that  like us  holds its assets through a partnership or a limited liability company 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
in order to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy a number of requirements  including requirements regarding the composition of our assets and two gross income tests a at least of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualified sources  such as rents from real property  mortgage interest  distributions from other reits and gains from sale of such assets  and b at least of our gross income must be derived from sources meeting the income test above  and other passive investment sources  such as other interest and dividends and gains from sales of securities 
also  we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least of our reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gains 
in addition  new legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors  our ability to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments 
we may be subject to federal and state income taxes that would harm our financial condition 
even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit  we may become subject to federal income taxes and related state taxes 
for example  if we have net income from a sale of dealer property or inventory  or  if our management company enters into agreements with us or our tenants on a basis that is determined to be other than an arm s length basis  that income will be subject to a penalty tax 
if we believe that a sale of a property might be treated as a prohibited transaction  we will attempt to structure a sale through a taxable reit subsidiary  in which case the gain from the sale would be subject to corporate income tax but not the prohibited transaction tax 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs would not assert successfully that sales of properties that we make directly  rather than through a taxable reit subsidiary  were sales of dealer property or inventory  in which case the penalty tax will apply 
in addition  we may not be able to make sufficient distributions to avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax on undistributed income 
we may also be subject to state and local taxes on our income or property  either directly or at the level of our operating partnership or the university towers partnership or at a level of the other entities through which we indirectly own our properties that would aversely affect our operating results 
an investment in our common stock has various tax risks  including the treatment of distributions in excess of earnings and the inability to apply passive losses against distributions 
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits  to the extent that they exceed the adjusted basis of an investor s common stock  will be treated as long term capital gain or short term capital gain if the shares have been held for less than one year 
any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares by a stockholder who is not a dealer in securities will be treated as a long term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year  and otherwise will be treated as short term capital gain or loss 
distributions that we properly designate as capital gain distributions will be treated as taxable to stockholders as gains to the extent that they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year from the sale or disposition of a capital asset held for greater than one year 
distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a stockholder of shares of our stock will not be treated as passive income  meaning stockholders generally will not be able to apply any passive losses against such income or gain 

table of contents future distributions may include a significant portion as a return of capital 
our distributions have historically and may continue to exceed the amount of our income as a reit 
if so  the excess distributions will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder s basis in our stock  and the stockholder s basis in our stock will be reduced by such amount 
to the extent distributions exceed a stockholder s basis in our stock  the stockholder will recognize capital gain  assuming the stock is held as a capital asset
