del selling  general and administrative    internal research and development    operating expenses  del 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of an increase in marketing activities  professional services  stock based compensation  and higher head count and related employee costs to support our overall growth 
in addition  commissions to our network of independent sales representatives related to sales of solar equipment were up due to increased sales and revenues 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased to of sales and revenues in as compared to in the reduction was primarily due to the absorption of selling  general and administrative overhead costs by the increase in sales and revenues 
selling  general and administrative expense includes approximately  of stock based compensation in versus  in internal research and development expenses internal research and development expense increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of our cost sharing contract with the nrel reducing costs 
in addition  spire semiconductor had higher head count and related employee costs for as a percentage of sales and revenue  however  internal research and development expenses remained at for both periods 
gain on sale of trademark we sold gloria solar a pv module line operated by the our solar system business along with the transfer of technology and rights to mark the modules with our trademark to build  design and sell specialty bipv and pv modules  in exchange for  in cash 
this transaction closed on september  we believe the sale of the trademark and the other goods and services meets the criteria of emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  paragraph a  as each element has utility on a stand alone basis 
further  question to sab topic a f was considered as guidance for determining if the trademark fee under the agreement should be recognized as a sale 
as the trademark agreement has no term and is permanent in nature  the earnings process was complete  accordingly  we recognized a gain on the sale 
we determined the fair value of the trademark sale  the pv module line and services based on a third party appraisal 
as a result  a  gain was recognized on the sale of the trademark for the year ended december  we also recognized  in service revenue reflecting the delivery of pv technology designs to build pv modules 
we have sold and will continue to sell this technology to other customers as part of our equipment business 
as of december   the fair value of the undelivered goods and services was  which was in advances on contracts in progress and was later recognized in sales of goods in gloria solar has further contracted with us in and to purchase additional pv module equipment lines at market prices 
we also provide gloria solar general and administrative services and provide space in our facility on a pass through basis 
gain on termination of contract on may   we entered into the global consortium agreement with nisshinbo for the development  manufacturing  and sales of solar photovoltaic module manufacturing equipment 
on september   nisshinbo delivered a letter to us stating its intention to terminate the consortium agreement entered into between nisshinbo and us on may  pursuant to the consortium agreement  nisshinbo provided its day prior notice to terminate the consortium agreement  effective as of february  however  on november   we signed a separation and novation agreement the separation agreement with nisshinbo that  among other things  accelerated the termination of the consortium agreement and the payment by nisshinbo to us of an early termination penalty in the amount of million which was paid in december this penalty is recorded as a one time gain on termination of contract for the year ended december  in addition  we received a final royalty payment of approximately  from nisshinbo for outstanding equipment being built by nisshinbo for its customer base 
under the separation agreement  the termination of the consortium agreement was effective as of november  see note and note for more information on the consortium agreement and the separation agreement 
other income expense  net we earned  and  of interest income for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in earned interest relates to the decrease in interest rates during compared with we incurred interest expense of  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the slight increase in interest expense is due to higher interest payments associated with the equipment credit facility outstanding with silicon valley bank in compared with interest expenses primarily associated with interest incurred on capital leases associated with the semiconductor foundry 
the capital leases ended in may we recorded losses of  and  on the equity investment in the joint venture with gloria solar for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  increase in loss on equity investment in joint venture for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is attributable to reporting only two months of losses in  due to the formation of the joint venture on july   compared to twelve months reported in we report the ongoing financial results of the joint venture one quarter in arrears 
the joint venture has experienced significant losses in due to its inability to generate revenue commensurable with operating expenses 
we had currency exchange losses of approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the  increase in currency exchange losses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to unfavorable changes in the japanese yen effecting inventory purchases in income taxes we recorded a provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  we recorded a benefit for income taxes of  related to income from continuing operations for year ended december   representing the tax benefit of the continuing operation loss that is offset by the extraordinary gain 
a full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding the realization of the net operating loss in the future

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r fas r  business combinations  which revises fas and changes multiple aspects of the accounting for business combinations 
under the guidance in fas r  the acquisition method must be used  which requires the acquirer to recognize most identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in the acquire at their full fair value on the acquisition date 
goodwill is to be recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the non controlling interest over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are to be recognized in earnings  while contingent consideration classified as equity is not to be re measured 
costs such as transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting  generally leading to recognizing expense  and  additionally  restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as post acquisition costs 
fas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  and will change the accounting for business combinations on a prospective basis 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
therefore  we have adopted the provisions of fas with respect to its financial assets and liabilities only 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new standard provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on an exit price which is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the standard also prioritizes  within the measurement of fair value  the use of market based information over entity specific information and establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the application of fas in situations where the market for a financial asset is not active was clarified by the issuance of fasb staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  fas in october fas became effective immediately and did not significantly impact the methods by which we determine the fair values of our financial assets 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
fas  non controlling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fas requires that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary ie minority interest be reported in the equity section of the balance sheet instead of being reported as a liability or in the mezzanine section between debt and equity 
it also requires that the consolidated income statement include consolidated net income attributable to both the parent and non controlling interest of a consolidated subsidiary 
a disclosure must be made on the face of the consolidated income statement of the net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest 
also  regardless of whether the parent purchases additional ownership interest  sells a portion of its ownership interest in a subsidiary or the subsidiary participates in a transaction that changes the parent s ownership interest  as long as the parent retains controlling interest  the transaction is considered an equity transaction 
fas is effective for annual periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this standard will have on its financial position and results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
fas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under statement no 
and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
fas encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that this standard will have on its financial position and results of operations 
impact of inflation and changing prices historically  our business has not been materially impacted by inflation 
manufacturing equipment and solar systems are generally quoted  manufactured and shipped within a cycle of approximately nine months  allowing for orderly pricing adjustments to the cost of labor and purchased parts 
we have not experienced any negative effects from the impact of inflation on long term contracts 
our service business is not expected to be seriously affected by inflation because its procurement production cycle typically ranges from two weeks to several months  and prices generally are not fixed for more than one year 
research and development contracts usually include cost escalation provisions 
foreign currency fluctuation we sell only in us dollars  generally against an irrevocable confirmed letter of credit through a major united states bank 
accordingly  we are not directly affected by foreign exchange fluctuations on our current orders 
however  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates do have an effect on our customers access to us dollars and on the pricing competition on certain pieces of equipment that we sell in selected markets 
in addition  purchases made and royalties received under our consortium agreement with nisshinbo are in japanese yen 
in addition  we received japanese yen related to the termination of the consortium agreement in we have committed to purchase certain pieces of equipment from european vendors  these commitments are denominated in euros 
we bear the risk of any currency fluctuations that may be associated with these commitments 
we attempt to hedge known transactions when possible to minimize foreign exchange risk 
there were no hedged amounts at december  and foreign exchange loss included in other income expense was  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
related party transactions we subleased  square feet in a building leased by mykrolis corporation  who in turn leased the building from spi trust  a trust of which roger little  our chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president  is the sole trustee and principal beneficiary for the ten year period ending november effective december   we entered into a two year extension of lease agreement the lease extension directly with spi trust 
we assumed certain responsibilities of mykrolis  the tenant under the former lease  as a result of the lease extension including payment of all building and real estate related expenses associated with the ongoing operations of the property 
we allocated a portion of these expenses to spi trust based on pre established formulas utilizing square footage and actual usage where applicable 
these allocated expenses were invoiced monthly and were paid utilizing a spi trust escrow account of which we have sole withdrawal authority 
spi trust is required to maintain three months of its anticipated operating costs within this escrow account 
on december   we and spi trust amended the lease extension to include the lease of an additional  square feet from spi trust for a one year term 
the additional space was leased at a rate of per square foot on annual basis 
the additional space was used to expand our solar operations 
on november   we entered into a new lease agreement the new lease with spi trust  with respect to  square feet of space comprising the entire building in which we have occupied space since december  the term of the new lease commenced on december  and continues for five years until november  we have the right to extend the term of the new lease for an additional five year period 
the annual rental rate for the first year of the lease is per square foot on a triple net basis  whereby the tenant is responsible for operating expenses  taxes and maintenance of the building 
the annual rental rate increases on each anniversary by per square foot 
if we exercises our right to extend the term of the new lease  the annual rental rate for the first year of the extended term will be the greater of a the rental rate in effect immediately preceding the commencement of the extended term or b the market rate at such time  and on each anniversary of the commencement of the extended term the rental rate will increase by per square foot

rent expense under the hudson lease for the year ended december  was  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances  reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  stock based compensation  income taxes  and warranty reserves 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
refer to footnote of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we derive our revenues from three primary sources commercial products including  but not limited to  solar energy manufacturing equipment  solar energy systems and hemodialysis catheters  biomedical and semiconductor processing services  and united states government funded research and development contracts 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment of products provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
revenue from consignment arrangements is recognized based on product usage indicating sales are complete 
we utilize a distributor network to market and sell its hemodialysis catheters domestically 
we generally recognize revenue when the catheters are shipped to our distributors 
gross sales reflect reductions attributable to customer returns and various customer incentive programs including pricing discounts and rebates 
product returns are permitted in certain sales contracts and an allowance is recorded for returns based on our history of actual returns 
certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs 
the allowance for these programs is determined through an analysis of programs offered  historical trends  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  sales and payment trends  and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered 
an analysis of the sales return and rebate activity for the years ended december  and  is as follows caption rebates returns total 
del balance december     provision    utilization    balance december     provision    utilization balance december     del 
o credits for rebates are recorded in the month of the actual sale 
o credits for returns are processed when the actual merchandise is received by us 
o substantially all rebates and returns are processed no later than three months after original shipment by us 
the reserve percentage of inventory held by distributors over the past quarters has increased to approximately at december   when compared to at december  we perform various sensitivity analyses to determine the appropriate reserve percentage to use 
to date  actual reserve utilization has approximated the amount provided 
the total inventory held by distributors was approximately  at december  if sufficient history to make reasonable and reliable estimates of returns or rebates does not exist  revenue associated with such practices is deferred until the return period lapses or a reasonable estimate can be made 
this deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue when the distributor reports to us that it has either shipped or disposed of the units indicating that the possibility of return is remote 
our oem capital equipment solar energy business builds complex customized machines to order for specific customers 
most orders are sold on a fob bedford  massachusetts or ex works factory basis and other orders are sold on a cip or on rare situations a ddu basis 
it is our policy to recognize revenues for this equipment as title of the product has passed to the customer  as customer acceptance is obtained prior to shipment and the equipment is expected to operate the same in the customer s environment as it does in our environment 
when an arrangement with the customer includes future obligations or customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when those obligations are met or customer acceptance has been achieved 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate fair value to each element in the contract and revenue is recognized upon delivery of each element 
if we are not able to establish fair value of undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred 
we recognize revenues and estimated profits on long term government contracts on the accrual basis where the circumstances are such that total profit can be estimated with reasonable accuracy and ultimate realization is reasonably assured 
we accrue revenue and profit utilizing the percentage of completion method using a cost to cost methodology 
a percentage of the contract revenues and estimated profits is determined utilizing the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated cost to complete on a contract by contract basis 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon changes and facts  and any losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
some of the contracts include provisions to withhold a portion of the contract value as retainage until such time as the united states government performs an audit of the cost incurred under the contract 
our policy is to take into revenue the full value of the contract  including any retainage  as we perform against the contract because we have not experienced any substantial losses as a result of audits performed by the united states government 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
we actively pursue collection of past due receivables as the circumstances warrant 
customers are contacted to determine the status of payment and senior accounting and operations management are included in these efforts as is deemed necessary 
a specific reserve will be established for past due accounts when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
we do not record an allowance for government receivables and invoices backed by letters of credit as realizability is reasonably assured 
bad debts are written off against the allowance when identified 
there is no dollar threshold for account balance write offs 
while rare  a write off is only recorded when all efforts to collect the receivable have been exhausted and only in consultation with the appropriate business line manager 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are continually monitored and are evaluated at least annually for impairment 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no  r 
share based payment statement r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model as our method for determining the fair value of stock option grants 
statement r requires the fair value of all share based awards that are expected to vest to be recognized in the statements of operations over the service or vesting period of each award 
we use the straight line method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense for all stock option grants 
on november   the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided by the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects if any of stock based compensation expense pursuant to statement r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact to the additional paid in capital pool and the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of statement r 
warranty we provide warranties on certain products and services 
our warranty programs are described below spire solar equipment warrants solar energy module manufacturing equipment sold for a total of days  the first days of which include the replacement of defective component parts and the labor to correct the defect and the next days of which include only the cost of defective component parts 
spire biomedical warrants that any of its catheter products found to be defective will be replaced 
no warranty is made that the failure of the product will not occur  and we disclaim any responsibility for any medical complications 
spire biomedical warrants that its services only will meet the agreed upon specifications 
spire semiconductor warrants that its products will meet the agreed upon specifications 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties  determined primarily from historical information  at the time product revenue is recognized 
should actual product failure warranties differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required
