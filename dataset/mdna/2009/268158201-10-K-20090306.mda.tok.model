the immune system the immune system is the body s natural defense mechanism against disease causing agents  such as bacteria  viruses and parasites  and plays an important role in identifying and eliminating abnormal cells  such as cancer cells 
the body s first line of defense is an immediate  rapid response called innate immunity that protects the body during the days or weeks needed for a second  longer term immune response termed adaptive immunity to develop 
logo the diagram above is a visual representation of how the immune system reacts when it encounters antigen  or a foreign substance 
the immune system s response to any foreign substance involves a cascade of events orchestrated by specialized immune cells  leading to either a th or a th response  as illustrated in the above diagram 
dendritic cells  a type of immune cell  have two key functions in the initial  innate immune response 
first  they produce cytokines that help to kill viruses and bacteria 
second  they ensure that pathogens and other foreign substances are highly visible to specialized helper t cells  called th and th cells  which coordinate the longer term adaptive immune response 
dendritic cells recognize different types of offending substances and are able to guide the immune system to make the most appropriate response 
when viruses  bacteria and abnormal cells are encountered  dendritic cells trigger a th response  whereas when a parasite infection is detected  dendritic cells initiate a th response 
th and th responses last for an extended time in the form of th and th memory cells  conferring long term immunity 
the th response the th response involves the production of the body s most potent anti infective weapons specific cytokines  including interferon alpha  interferon gamma and interleukin il  as well as killer t cells  a specialized immune cell 
in addition  protective igg antibodies are generated that also help rid the body of foreign antigens and allergens 
once a population of th cells specific to a particular antigen or allergen is produced  it persists for a long time in the form of memory th cells  enabling a more rapid and powerful 
table of contents immune response the next time exposure to that particular antigen or allergen occurs 
an insufficient th response to an infection can result in chronic disease  whereas an inappropriate th response can cause diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 
the th response activation of the th response involves the production of other cytokines  il  il and il  which attract inflammatory cells such as eosinophils  basophils and mast cells  to destroy the invading organism 
the th response also leads to the generation of a specialized antibody  ige  which can recognize antigens and allergens  and further enhance the protective response 
an inappropriate th immune response to allergens  such as plant pollens  can lead to chronic inflammation and result in allergic rhinitis  asthma and other allergic diseases 
subsequent exposures to the same allergens can reactivate memory th cells  sustaining inflammation and leading to chronic disease 
immunostimulatory sequences iss our proprietary technology platform includes iss  which are short dna sequences that enhance the ability of the immune system to fight disease and control chronic inflammation 
iss activate the innate immune response by specifically targeting tlr  which is found on a specialized subset of immune cells 
iss work by changing or reprogramming the immune responses that cause disease rather than just treating the symptoms of the disease 
since tlr is found only in a specialized subset of dendritic cells  iss do not cause a generalized activation of the immune system and redirect the response of only those t cells involved in a given disease 
when linked to or combined with antigens  iss help generate memory th cells that can reprogram the immune system to induce long lasting therapeutic effects 
we have developed a number of proprietary iss compositions and formulations that make use of the different ways in which the innate immune system responds to iss 
depending on the indication for which iss is being explored as a therapy  we use iss in different ways 
iss linked to or combined with antigens for viral disease and bacterial infections  iss are linked to or combined with antigens to increase the visibility of the antigen and stimulate an immune response that will attack and destroy infected or abnormal cells 
this treatment induces a highly specific th immune response and generates memory t cells for long term protection 
this treatment has the potential to be used synergistically with other therapies 
iss alone for viral and respiratory diseases  iss can be used alone to modify the course of this disease by reprogramming the immune system 
iss suppress the th inflammatory response caused by any number of allergens to modify the underlying cause of inflammation as well as provide symptomatic relief 
advanced iss technologies for most of our preclinical programs  we use our advanced proprietary technologies that modify the molecular structure of iss to significantly increase their versatility and potency  allowing use of less iss 
these second generation iss stimulate specific immune responses  including potent interferon alpha induction 
immunoregulatory sequences irs our proprietary technology platform includes irs  which are short dna sequences that specifically inhibit tlrs associated with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
tlrs are key receptors of the innate immune 
table of contents system that can induce strong inflammatory responses 
in animal studies as well as in vitro  our tlr inhibitors have demonstrated broad potential in multiple autoimmune diseases models  such as lupus  inflammatory skin disorders  and rheumatoid arthritis 
these first in class endosomal tlr inhibitors specifically target two types of immune cells  b cells and plasmacytoid dendridtic cells pdc that selectively express tlr and tlr these receptors play a key role in the overproduction of interferon alpha by pdc and in the presence of anti nuclear autoantibodies generated by b cells  which are hallmarks of some autoimmune diseases such as lupus 
because our tlr inhibitors target only tlr and tlr  they do not inhibit all sources of interferon nor do they affect all antibody responses from b cells 
this suggests that these tlr inhibitors would not cause broad immunosuppression 
primary development programs our primary development programs are as follows product candidate clinical indication s phase partnership funding support infectious diseases heplisav hepatitis b prevention phase dynavax sd hepatitis c infection phase b symphony dynamo inc dv hepatitis b infection phase b dynavax respiratory diseases universal flu vaccine influenza prevention preclinical novartis supply and option agreement  nih azd asthma preclinical astrazeneca ab autoimmune and inflammatory diseases dv autoimmune and inflammatory diseases preclinical glaxosmithkline  nih heplisav hepatitis b vaccine our lead product candidate is heplisav  a phase hepatitis b vaccine that has shown clinical benefits in our trials 
our clinical trials conducted over the past years have included approximately  individuals vaccinated with heplisav 
in august  heplisav met its primary endpoint in the largest clinical trial conducted to date  a phase trial known as phast phase heplisav short regimen trial 
heplisav is based on our proprietary iss that specifically target tlr to stimulate an innate immune response 
this vaccine combines our first generation iss with hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag manufactured in our dynavax europe facility in d sseldorf  germany 
heplisav is aimed at unmet needs in the vaccination of adults and end stage renal disease esrd patients by providing an increased response with fewer doses in a shorter period of time 
clinical development was suspended in march  when the us food and drug administration fda placed a clinical hold on the two heplisav investigational new drug ind applications  one for healthy adults and one for esrd patients 
the fda requested a review of the clinical and preclinical safety data related to heplisav  including all available information about a single case of wegener s granulomatosis  an uncommon form of vasculitis 
in october and february  the fda requested additional information which the agency indicated may be helpful in its risk assessment of the two inds and may assist in finding a development path forward for heplisav for healthy adults and esrd patients 
at present  the two inds remain on clinical hold in the united states 
heplisav has not been put on clinical hold by any regulatory authority outside the united states 

table of contents we are seeking clarification of the remaining regulatory requirements for the development and licensure of heplisav in the united states and europe 
there can be no assurance as to whether heplisav can be further developed  or even if further development is permitted  that successful clinical development can occur in a timely manner or without significant additional studies or patient data 
if the regulatory feedback favors continued development  we plan to pursue a partnership or financing arrangement to complete heplisav s development 
dynavax holds all development  manufacturing  and commercialization rights to heplisav following merck co  inc s termination of our collaboration agreement in december clinical results in the largest clinical trial conducted to date  known as phast  heplisav met its primary endpoint 
the multi center phast trial evaluated more than  subjects from to years of age in canada and germany 
this phase trial randomized subjects three to one and evaluated a two dose regimen of heplisav administered at and month  compared to a three dose regimen of engerix b administered at   and months 
the primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who developed protective antibody to hepatitis b after receiving a full course of vaccination 
immunogenicity results from this trial demonstrated that subjects receiving heplisav were seroprotected with fewer doses and at an earlier time point than subjects receiving engerix b 
results showed percent of subjects who received two doses of heplisav at and month developed protective antibody to hepatitis b when measured at weeks 
this compared to percent of subjects who received three doses of engerix b at   and months when measured at weeks 
overall safety results in the phast trial showed the profile of heplisav appeared similar to engerix b  with the exception that subjects who received heplisav had a higher risk of developing injection site swelling  redness  and pain compared to those who received engerix b 
the incidence of adverse events ae was percent for the heplisav group  compared to percent for the engerix b group 
the incidence of serious adverse events saes was percent for the heplisav group  compared to percent for the engerix b group 
there were two cases of systemic vasculitis reported as saes in this trial  a case of wegener s granulomatosis  or c anca vasculitis  in the heplisav group and a case of p anca systemic vasculitis in the engerix b group 
commercial opportunity we estimate the hepatitis b vaccine market for healthy adults and esrd patients worldwide to be approximately million annually 
there can be no assurance that heplisav will be approved for these market segments in any particular territory 
hepatitis b is a chronic disease which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma 
there is no cure for hepatitis b and disease prevention through effective vaccines is critical to reducing the spread of the disease 
available hepatitis b vaccines for adults usually require doses given over months to provide seroprotection of approximately   and after the first  second  and third doses respectively 
vaccines provide seroprotection to only approximately of persons over years of age after doses and also fail to provide seroprotection to a large percentage of immunocompromised persons  such as esrd patients 
the effectiveness of current vaccines is further compromised because only of people receive all doses 
heplisav is designed to address the limitations of current vaccines by delivering complete vaccination in fewer doses and months earlier than current vaccines 
in addition  previous clinical data have demonstrated that heplisav can provide an increased response for older and immunocompromised individuals 
greater prevention of disease could be attained with use of heplisav where individuals could be seroprotected with fewer doses and at an earlier time point than with current vaccines

table of contents sd hepatitis c therapy sd is our hepatitis c therapy and is being evaluated in an ongoing phase b clinical trial 
this therapy utilizes a novel type c tlr agonist based on our second generation iss and may offer a more effective therapeutic option for patients chronically infected with the hepatitis c virus hcv 
we are developing sd through our symphony dynamo  inc funding agreement 
sd is designed to be a potential replacement for interferon alpha therapy and be used in combination with oral antiviral therapy to stop hcv viral replication and induce a long lasting immune response 
in april  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital partners  lp and certain of its affiliates symphony to advance specific dynavax iss based programs for cancer  hepatitis b therapy and hepatitis c therapy through certain stages of clinical development development programs 
the agreements provided for the formation of symphony dynamo  inc sdi 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony invested million in sdi to fund the development programs  and we licensed to sdi our intellectual property rights related to the development programs 
the current status of sdi is discussed below under symphony dynamo inc commercial opportunity according to the world health organization  there are over million people worldwide chronically infected with hcv 
analysts estimate the worldwide market for hcv therapies will grow from approximately billion in to over billion by there is no vaccine available to prevent hcv  a disease of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma 
current therapy consists of pegylated interferon alpha and the antiviral drug ribavirin and is effective in treating only half of all patients infected with hcv 
this standard of care is significantly less effective in genotype carriers  which represent of all hcv carriers in the united states and europe 
in addition  treatment with these therapies can cause significant side effects  including severe depression and anemia 
products offering enhanced efficacy and safety profiles are anticipated to increase the number of patients seeking and continuing treatment 
sd  used in combination with oral antiviral therapy  may stop hcv viral replication and induce a long lasting immune response and could become a potential replacement for interferon alpha therapy  although there can be no assurance that sdi can achieve such outcome or address the current market for interferon alpha therapy 
dv hepatitis b therapy dv is our proprietary hepatitis b therapy and is in phase clinical trial development 
this novel treatment approach for the first time combines both the surface and core hepatitis b virus hbv antigens 
dv may induce a potent immune response against hbv infected cells and offer a more effective and shorter duration therapeutic option for patients chronically infected with hbv 
commercial opportunity over million individuals worldwide are chronically infected with hbv  which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma 
analysts estimate the current worldwide market for hbv therapies to be approximately billion annually 
current treatment aims to halt progression of the disease and consist of either indefinite use of antiviral medication or treatment with pegylated interferon alpha 
approximately of treated patients achieve treatment goals and fewer than are ever considered cured 
antiviral therapy may need to continue indefinitely to sustain treatment goals and is increasingly subject to antiviral resistance while treatment with interferon alpha can cause significant side effects 

table of contents our hbv therapy  being studied in combination with an antiviral  is expected to induce a potent immune response against hbv infected cells and offer a more effective and shorter duration therapeutic option for chronically infected patients 
preclinical programs in addition to our clinical stage product candidates  our pipeline includes preclinical programs for influenza  asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
universal flu vaccine our universal flu vaccine candidate is being developed to address unmet needs in controlling influenza by providing broad immunity to divergent flu strains and enhanced efficacy against strains in the trivalent seasonal vaccine 
our vaccine candidate will include me np iss a proprietary fusion protein comprised of two conserved influenza antigens  the extracellular domain of the matrix protein me and nucleoprotein np  linked to our second generation iss trivalent influenza vaccine tiv the me np iss fusion protein conjugate may offer the benefits of cross strain protection  dose sparing  and enhanced immunogenicity 
me np iss is expected to enable subjects to generate me specific cytotoxic protective antibodies and np specific cytotoxic t cell protection  as well as enhance the strain specific neutralizing antibodies induced by the trivalent influenza vaccine 
novartis is supplying the trivalent influenza vaccine component for clinical and commercial use and has an exclusive option to negotiate a joint development and commercialization agreement 
our research and development program for our universal flu vaccine has been partially funded by grants from the nih 
commercial opportunity human viral influenza is an acute respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality that occurs in annual epidemics worldwide 
there are an estimated  to  viral influenza associated deaths per year in the united states  primarily in those over years of age 
influenza pandemics occur infrequently  on average every to years  but it is estimated that the next pandemic could result in millions of deaths worldwide 
analysts estimate the current worldwide market opportunity for seasonal influenza vaccines to be approximately billion annually 
seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines can provide protection against the flu strains predicted to be prevalent during a season 
the efficacy of these vaccines is often decreased by unpredictable changes in the actual strains causing influenza 
current vaccines are also least effective in those who need prevention the most  the elderly and others with weaker immune systems 
pandemic vaccination is further complicated by the need to produce large quantities of vaccine in a short time period 
our universal flu vaccine candidate is being developed to address many of the challenges of current vaccines with the goal of providing broad immunity against divergent influenza strains  increasing the efficacy of seasonal vaccines  and potentially providing dose sparing and increasing the quantity of vaccine available 
azd asthma therapy together with our partner astrazeneca  we are developing azd  a novel candidate drug for asthma 
azd utilizes our proprietary second generation iss and represents a new strategy for the treatment of 
table of contents allergic respiratory diseases such as asthma 
this therapy is designed to modify the course of these diseases by changing the basic immune response to environmental allergens  such as house dust and pollens  leading to prolonged reduction in asthma symptoms 
we are developing adz under our worldwide collaboration with astrazeneca to discover  develop  and commercialize products for asthma and copd 
we are currently working on a second candidate drug and have extended our research collaboration with astrazeneca to provide research funding for a third candidate 
commercial opportunity according to the world health organization  asthma affects million people worldwide 
asthma is a chronic disease of the lungs and is caused primarily by allergic inflammation of the airways 
in addition  million people worldwide are affected by copd  a term used to describe chronic lung diseases that limit airflow in the lungs 
analysts estimate the current worldwide market opportunity for asthma and copd therapies to be over billion annually 
current asthma and copd therapies include corticosteroids and bronchodilators  which treat the symptoms of these respiratory diseases 
azd is intended to be a disease modifying therapy that has demonstrated the potential to inhibit and induce durable changes to the allergic response that causes asthma symptoms 
dv irs for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases we have pioneered a new approach to treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases with our first in class tlr inhibitors called irs 
our lead inhibitor product candidate is dv  a bifunctional inhibitor of tlr and tlr we are developing our tlr inhibitor programs under our worldwide strategic alliance with gsk established in december in animal studies as well as in vitro  our tlr inhibitors have demonstrated broad potential in multiple autoimmune disease models  such as lupus  inflammatory skin disorders  and rheumatoid arthritis 
our inhibitors have a highly targeted effect on key immune cells and pathways that play a role in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
specifically  our tlr inhibitors target two types of immune cells  b cells and pdc  which selectively express tlr and tlr these receptors play a key role in the overproduction of interferon alpha by pdc and in the presence of anti nuclear autoantibodies generated by b cells  which are hallmarks of some autoimmune diseases such as lupus 
commercial opportunity over million individuals in the us and europe have autoimmune diseases such as lupus  psoriasis  and rheumatoid arthritis 
analysts estimate that key biologic drugs used to treat these conditions generate over billion in worldwide sales each year 
currently marketed therapies are broadly immunosuppressive with variable efficacy and substantial toxicity 
our tlr inhibitors have demonstrated a highly targeted effect on key immune cells and pathways that play a role in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases 
pharmaceutical partnerships and funding agreements our objective is to discover novel therapies based on our proprietary technologies and develop a diversified pipeline of product candidates to build a product based business 
to reach this objective  an important part of our strategy is to establish partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies and enter into funding agreements 
our pharmaceutical partners provide valuable resources  development expertise  and commercial abilities that allow us to further advance the development of our product candidate programs 
we have also established funding agreements with investment entities and us government institutions that focus on biopharmaceutical developments 

table of contents glaxosmithkline in december  we entered into a worldwide strategic alliance with gsk to discover  develop  and commercialize endosomal tlr inhibitors for diseases such as lupus  psoriasis  and rheumatoid arthritis

in september  we received a million milestone payment from astrazeneca for the nomination of the first candidate drug azd for asthma and we have initiated ind enabling studies 
we are currently working on a second candidate drug  and in february  we extended our research collaboration with astrazeneca to provide funding for a third candidate drug 
novartis vaccines and diagnostics  inc in july  we entered into a supply and option agreement with novartis for our universal flu vaccine 
under this agreement  novartis is supplying trivalent influenza vaccine  an essential component of our universal flu vaccine 
we agreed to conduct early stage development through a defined proof of concept 
if novartis exercises the right to negotiate a further agreement for development and commercialization  we would retain co commercialization rights in the us and receive product royalties outside of the us should the option not be exercised  novartis remains committed to providing commercial supply of trivalent influenza vaccine with pre agreed commercial terms and we retain the right to independently continue with late stage development and commercialization 
symphony dynamo  inc in april  we entered into a million funding agreement with symphony capital partners  lp and its co investors 
under this agreement  symphony dynamo  inc sdi was formed to develop novel tlr agonist products for hepatitis c  hepatitis b and cancer 
although sdi holds the intellectual property rights to these products  we have an option which allows us the exclusive right  but not the obligation  to acquire certain or all of the programs at specified points of time during the five year agreement 
in april  we exercised our option to acquire the rights to our hepatitis b therapy program and triggered a payment obligation of million which is due upon the expiration of the sdi collaboration in  if the purchase option for all programs is not exercised 
in december  we discontinued the cancer program to focus on the hepatitis c therapy program 
we have retained the right to seek strategic partners for the future development and commercialization of the cancer and hepatitis c therapy products 
national institutes of health and other funding for our tlr agonist programs  since we have been awarded million in grants from the nih which have helped fund our research and development  of which a substantial portion has been used to support the development of our universal flu vaccine 
although the nih provides program support  we have retained the right to seek strategic partners for the future development and commercialization of our universal flu vaccine 
in september  we were awarded a million contract to develop our advanced iss technology using tlr 
table of contents agonists as vaccine adjuvants 
this five year contract was awarded by the nih s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid and supports adjuvant development for biodefense vaccines  including anthrax as well as other disease models 
niaid is funding percent of the total million cost of our program under contract no 
hhsnc 
for our tlr inhibitor programs  since we have been awarded million in grants from the nih and alliance for lupus research 
certain of these grants have been extended through june intellectual property our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates  technology and know how  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
in addition to seeking patent protection in the united states  we generally file patent applications in australia  canada  japan  western european countries and additional foreign countries on a selective basis in order to further protect the inventions that we or our partners consider important to the development of our foreign business 
we also rely on trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information 
our intellectual property portfolio includes issued patents and patent applications claiming compositions and formulations of iss and irs  their methods of use and processes for their manufacture 
some of these patents and applications are exclusively licensed to us under agreements with the regents of the university of california 
under the terms of our license agreements with the regents of the university of california  we are required to pay license fees  make milestone payments and pay royalties on net sales resulting from successful products originating from the licensed technologies 
we may terminate these agreements in whole or in part on days advance notice 
the regents of the university of california may terminate these agreements if we are in breach for failure to make royalty payments  meet diligence requirements  produce required reports or fund internal research and we do not cure such breach within days after being notified of the breach 
otherwise  the agreements generally continue in effect until the last patent claiming a product licensed under the agreement or its manufacture or use expires  or in the absence of patents  until the date the last patent application claiming a licensed product is abandoned 
individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained 
generally  patents issued in the united states are effective for the longer of years from the issue date or years from the earliest effective filing date  if the patent application was filed prior to june   and years from the earliest effective filing date  if the patent application was filed on or after june  in addition  in certain instances  a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the fda regulatory review period 
the duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law  but typically is years from the earliest effective filing date 
our patent estate  based on patents existing now and expected by us to issue based on pending applications  will expire on dates ranging from to the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis  from country to country and depends upon many factors  including the type of patent  the scope of its coverage  the availability of regulatory related extensions  the availability of legal remedies in a particular country  and the validity and enforceability of the patents 

table of contents because patent applications in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until months after filing and publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications 
the us patent and trademark office may declare interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications and those of other parties or reexamination or reissue proceedings to determine if the scope of a patent should be narrowed 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties 
a number of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies including pfizer  inc  as well as universities and research institutions  may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover inventions similar to the inventions owned or licensed to us 
we cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to make  use or sell any products 
if another party controls patents or patent applications covering our products  we may not be able to obtain the rights we need to those patents or patent applications in order to commercialize our products 
litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party s proprietary rights 
the existence of third party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
for example  pfizer has issued us patent claims  as well as patent claims pending with the us patent and trademark office  that  if held to be valid  could require us to obtain a license in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss in the united states 
litigation or any of these other proceedings  such as patent interferences  could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us  and an adverse outcome in a court or patent office could subject us to significant liabilities  require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties  or require us to cease using some of our technology 
we may not prevail in any of these actions or proceedings 
in addition  other parties may duplicate  design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or our licensors 
we may rely  in some circumstances  on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology 
although trade secrets are difficult to protect  wherever possible  we use confidential disclosure agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our technology 
our policy is to require each of our commercial partners  employees  consultants and advisors to enter into an agreement before beginning their employment  consulting or advisory relationship with us that in general provides that the individuals must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any of our confidential information developed or learned by the individuals during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances 
these agreements also generally provide that we own all inventions conceived by the individuals in the course of rendering their employment or services to us 
however  there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets and or proprietary information will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us  disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies  intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products 
many of our competitors  including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions and other research organizations  are actively engaged in the discovery  research and development of products that could compete directly or indirectly with our products under development 
heplisav  a two dose hepatitis b vaccine  if developed  approved and commercialized  will compete directly with three dose marketed vaccines produced by gsk  merck and crucell nv  among others 
there are 
table of contents also modified schedules of conventional hepatitis b vaccines for limited age ranges that are approved in european union and united states 
in addition  heplisav will compete against a number of multivalent vaccines that simultaneously protect against hepatitis b in addition to other diseases 
our hepatitis c therapy  sd  if developed  approved  and commercialized  may compete directly with interferon alpha and indirectly with ribavirin  products currently marketed by roche and schering plough corporation 
other companies  such as vertex pharmaceuticals  inc tibotec pharmaceuticals  schering plough  human genome sciences  inc novartis  and roche pharmasset  inc 
intermune  inc are developing direct acting antiviral therapy  including protease inhibitors and polymerase inhibitors  and long acting interferons 
as these products may enter the market within the next two to five years  combination therapy is likely to evolve 
novel therapies aim to improve the efficacy  safety and convenience of current hepatitis c treatment and may compete both directly and indirectly with sd our hepatitis b therapy  dv  if developed  approved and commercialized  will compete directly with existing hepatitis b therapy products  including antiviral drugs and interferon alpha  manufactured by roche  schering plough  gilead sciences  inc  bristol myers squibb  gsk  and novartis 
in addition  our hepatitis b therapy faces competition from several companies developing novel antivirals  including pharmasset and lg life sciences  as well as companies developing therapy vaccines  including emergent biosolutions and genexine co  ltd 
our universal flu vaccine  if developed  approved and commercialized  will compete with traditional and emerging influenza vaccines from companies currently marketing these products  including gsk  novartis  sanofi pasteur msd  medimmune astrazeneca and csl ltd 
in addition  there are several companies developing potentially competing universal vaccines for influenza  including acambis  vaxinnate  merck and vical 
our asthma therapy  azd  if developed  approved and commercialized  will compete indirectly with existing asthma therapies  such as inhaled beta agonists  corticosteroids  leukotriene inhibitors and ige monoclonal antibodies  including those marketed by merck  genentech  inc  novartis  astrazeneca  schering plough and gsk 
in addition  directly competing products are in development by idera pharmaceuticals novartis and sanofi aventis pfizer inc our therapy for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases  dv  is a bifunctional inhibitor of tlr and tlr that if developed  approved and commercialized will compete with key biologic therapies from companies such as genentech  biogen idec  roche and abbott laboratories 
in addition  our product would compete with generic drugs commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases  including corticosteroids  nsaids  antimalarials and immunosuppressive agents 
other companies  such as medimmune  genentech  idera  pfizer  human genome sciences gsk and ucb immunomedics  inc  are developing anti ifn alpha antibodies  b cell targeted antibodies  immunosuppressants  and other tlr inhibitors that may compete directly with our product candidate 
many of the entities developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical testing  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than dynavax 
smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly for collaborative agreements with large  established companies and access to capital 
these entities may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs 
regulatory considerations the advertising  labeling  storage  record keeping  safety  efficacy  research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of our potential products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
in the us  pharmaceutical and biological 
table of contents products are subject to rigorous review by the fda under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the public health service act and other federal statutes and regulations 
the steps ordinarily required by the fda before a new drug or biologic may be marketed in the us are similar to steps required in most other countries and include but are not limited to the following completion of preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical trials and formulation studies  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application  or ind  for a new drug or biologic which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for each proposed indication  the submission of a new drug application  or nda  or a biologics license application  or bla  to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla before any commercial marketing  sale or shipment of the drug 
if we do not comply with applicable requirements  us regulatory authorities may fine us  require that we recall our products  seize our products  require that we totally or partially suspend the production of our products  refuse to approve our marketing applications  criminally prosecute us  and or revoke previously granted marketing authorizations 
to secure fda approval  we must submit extensive non clinical and clinical data  manufacturing information  and other supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish a product candidate s safety and efficacy 
the number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for fda and foreign regulatory agency approvals varies depending on the product candidate  the disease or condition for which the product candidate is in development and regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance 
further  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
the approval process takes many years  requires the expenditures of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and may involve requirements for additional post marketing studies 
the fda may also require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products 
the fda may withdraw product approvals if we do not continue to comply with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 
delays experienced during the governmental approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have exclusive rights to exploit patented products or technologies 
delays can occur at any stage of drug development and as result of many factors  certain of which are not under our control  including but not limited to the following lack of efficacy  or incomplete or inconclusive results from clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  failure by investigators to adhere to protocol requirements  including patient enrollment criteria  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment  failure by subjects to comply with trial protocol requirements  inability to follow patients adequately after treatment  inability to qualify and enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture sufficient quality and quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  failure by a contract research organization to fulfill contractual obligations  and adverse changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance 

table of contents non clinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the initial efficacy and safety of the product 
the fda  under its good laboratory practices regulations  regulates non clinical studies 
violations of these regulations can  in some cases  lead to invalidation of those studies  requiring these studies to be replicated 
the results of the non clinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application  which must be approved by the fda before we can commence clinical investigations in humans 
unless the fda objects to an investigational new drug application  the investigational new drug application will become effective days following its receipt by the fda 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator 
we must conduct our clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice under protocols submitted to the fda as part of the investigational new drug application 
in addition  each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an investigational review board and with patient informed consent 
the investigational review board will consider  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects and the possibility of liability of the institution conducting the trial 
the stages of the fda regulatory process include research and preclinical studies and clinical trials in three sequential phases that may overlap 
research and preclinical studies do not involve the introduction of a product candidate in human subjects 
these activities involve identification of potential product candidates  modification of promising candidates to optimize their biological activity  as well as preclinical studies to assess safety and effectiveness in animals 
in clinical trials  the product candidate is administered to humans 
phase clinical trials typically involve the administration of a product candidate into a small group of healthy human subjects 
these trials are the first attempt to evaluate a drug s safety  determine a safe dose range and identify side effects 
during phase trials  the product candidate is introduced into patients who suffer from the medical condition that the product candidate is intended to treat 
phase studies are designed to evaluate whether a product candidate shows evidence of effectiveness  to further evaluate dosage  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when phase evaluations demonstrate that a product candidate appears to be both safe and effective  phase trials are undertaken to confirm a product candidate s effectiveness and to test for safety in an expanded patient population 
if the results of phase trials appear to confirm effectiveness and safety  the data gathered in all phases of clinical trials form the basis for an application for fda regulatory approval of the product candidate 
we and all of our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practice gmp regulations 
manufacturers of biologics also must comply with fda s general biological product standards 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product 
good manufacturing practice regulations require quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
prior to granting product approval  the fda must determine that our or our third party contractor s manufacturing facilities meet good manufacturing practice requirements before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products 
in addition  our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the fda for continued compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements during clinical development as well as following product approval 
adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the fda and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal 
outside the us  our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization and pricing or reimbursement approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  marketing authorization  pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations may be applied for at a national level  although within the european union registration procedures are mandatory for biotechnology and some other drugs and are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
the regulatory authority generally will grant marketing authorization if it is satisfied that we have presented it with adequate evidence of safety  quality and efficacy 

table of contents we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research 
we cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including phds  phds and others with advanced degrees 
of the employees  were dedicated to research and development activities 
none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and we believe our relations with our employees are good

risk factors 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning our future products  product candidates  development plans  expenses  revenues  liquidity and cash needs  as well as our commercialization plans and strategies 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update this information 
numerous factors could cause our actual results to differ significantly from the results described in these forward looking statements  including the following risk factors 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and do not have any commercial products that generate significant revenue 
we have experienced significant net losses in each year since our inception 
our accumulated deficit was million as of december  to date  our revenue has resulted from collaboration agreements  services and license fees from customers of dynavax europe  and government and private agency grants 
the grants are subject to annual review based on the achievement of milestones and other factors 
our current grants are scheduled to terminate in  although we recently received a five year government contract totaling million 
we anticipate that we will incur substantial additional net losses for the foreseeable future as the result of our investment in research and development activities 
we do not have any products that generate revenue 
the clinical hold on the two us ind applications for heplisav remains in effect and our partner for this product has notified us of termination of our collaboration agreement 
clinical trials for certain of our other product candidates are ongoing 
these and our other product candidates may never be commercialized  and we may never achieve profitability 
our ability to generate revenue depends upon demonstrating in clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective  in particular  in the current and planned trials for our product candidates  obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and entering into and maintaining successful collaborative relationships 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues or achieve profitability  we may be required to reduce or discontinue our current and planned operations  enter into a transaction that constitutes a change in control of the company  or raise additional capital on less favorable terms 

table of contents if we are unable to secure additional funding  we will have to reduce or discontinue operations 
we believe our existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
because of the significant time and resources it will take to develop and commercialize our product candidates  we will require substantial additional capital resources in order to continue our operations  and any such funding in the current financing environment may not allow us to continue operations as currently planned 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all and we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some or all of our programs  or discontinue our operations 
the success of our product candidates depends on achieving successful clinical results and regulatory approval 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could require us to discontinue operations 
none of our product candidates have been approved for sale 
any product candidate we develop is subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities in the united states  including the fda  and by foreign regulatory agencies 
our success is primarily dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our most advanced product candidates 
the clinical hold on the two us ind applications for heplisav remains in effect 
approval processes in the united states and in other countries are uncertain  take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
we will need to demonstrate in clinical trials that a product candidate is safe and effective before we can obtain the necessary approvals from the fda and foreign regulatory agencies 
if we identify any safety issues associated with our product candidates  we may be restricted from initiating further trials for those products 
moreover  we may not see sufficient signs of efficacy in those studies 
the fda or foreign regulatory agencies may require us to conduct additional clinical trials prior to approval 
for example  in october the fda communicated that the balance of risk versus potential benefit no longer favors continued clinical evaluation of heplisav in healthy adults and children  but advised us that there may be an acceptable risk versus potential benefit profile for esrd patients 
in february  the fda requested additional clinical and safety information which the agency indicated may be helpful in its risk assessment of the two inds and may assist in finding a development path forward for heplisav  not only in esrd patients but also in healthy adults 
there can be no assurance as to whether heplisav can be further developed  or even if further development is permitted  that successful clinical development can occur in a timely manner or without significant additional studies or patient data 
despite the time and money expended  regulatory approvals are uncertain 
failure to successfully complete clinical trials and show that our products are safe and effective would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our clinical trials may be extended  suspended  delayed or terminated at any time 
even short delays in the commencement and progress of our trials may lead to substantial delays in the regulatory approval process for our product candidates  which will impair our ability to generate revenues 
we may extend  suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for various reasons  including regulatory actions by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies  actions by institutional review boards  failure to comply with good clinical practice requirements  concerns regarding health risks to test subjects or inadequate supply of the product candidate 
even a small delay in a trial for any product candidate could require us to delay commencement of the trial until the target population is available for testing  which could result in a delay of a year or more 
our registration and commercial timelines depend on results of the current and planned clinical trials and further discussions with the fda 
any extension  suspension  termination or unanticipated delays of our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to timely and successfully commercialize or market these product candidates  result in significant additional costs  
table of contents potentially diminish any competitive advantages for those products  adversely affect our ability to enter into collaborations  receive milestone payments or royalties from potential collaborators  cause us to abandon the development of the affected product candidate  or limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we receive regulatory approval for our product candidates  we will be subject to ongoing fda and foreign regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review 
any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates are likely to contain requirements for post marketing follow up studies  which may be costly 
product approvals  once granted  may be modified based on data from subsequent studies or long term use 
as a result  limitations on labeling indications or marketing claims  or withdrawal from the market may be required if problems occur after commercialization 
in addition  we or our contract manufacturers will be required to adhere to federal regulations setting forth current good manufacturing practice 
the regulations require that our product candidates be manufactured and our records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and quality control activities 
furthermore  we or our contract manufacturers must pass a pre approval inspection of manufacturing facilities by the fda and foreign regulatory agencies before obtaining marketing approval and will be subject to periodic inspection by the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
further  to the extent that we contract with third parties for the manufacture of our products  our ability to control third party compliance with fda requirements will be limited to contractual remedies and rights of inspection 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could prevent or delay marketing approval or require the expenditure of money or other resources to correct 
failure to comply with applicable requirements may also result in warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution  any of which could be harmful to our ability to generate revenues and our stock price 
our most advanced product candidate and most of our earlier stage programs rely on iss based technology 
serious adverse safety data relating to either iss or other iss based technology may require us to reduce the scope of or discontinue our operations 
our most advanced product candidate in clinical trials is based on our iss compound  and most of our research and development programs use iss based technology 
if any of our product candidates in clinical trials produce serious adverse safety data  we may be required to delay or discontinue all of our clinical trials 
for example  since march  heplisav has been and remains on clinical hold following a sae that occurred in the phast clinical trial 
as most of our clinical product candidates contain iss  a common safety risk across therapeutic areas may hinder our ability to enter into potential collaborations and if adverse safety data are found to apply to our iss based technology as a whole  we may be required to significantly reduce or discontinue our operations 
we rely on third parties and our facility in d sseldorf  germany to supply materials necessary to manufacture our clinical product candidates for our clinical trials 
loss of these suppliers or key employees in d sseldorf  or failure to timely replace them may delay our clinical trials and research and development efforts and may result in additional costs  delays or significantly higher costs in manufacturing our product candidates 
we rely on a number of third parties and our facility in d sseldorf for the multiple steps involved in the manufacturing process of our product candidates  including  for example  iss  a key component material that is necessary for our product candidates  the production of certain antigens  the combination of the antigens and iss  and the fill and finish 
termination or interruption of these relationships may occur due to circumstances that are outside of our control  resulting in higher cost or delays in our product development efforts 

table of contents we and these third parties are required to comply with applicable fda current good manufacturing practice regulations and other international regulatory requirements 
if one of these parties fails to maintain compliance with these regulations  the production of our product candidates could be interrupted  resulting in delays and additional costs 
additionally  these third parties and our manufacturing facility must undergo a pre approval inspection before we can obtain marketing authorization for any of our product candidates 
we have relied on a single supplier to produce our iss for clinical trials 
to date  we have manufactured only small quantities of iss ourselves for research purposes 
if we were unable to maintain or replace our existing source for iss  we would have to establish internal iss manufacturing capability which would result in increased capital and operating costs and delays in developing and commercializing our product candidates 
we or other third parties may not be able to produce iss at a cost  quantity and quality that are available from our current third party supplier 
we currently utilize our facility in d sseldorf to manufacture the hepatitis b surface antigen for heplisav 
the clinical hold on the two us ind applications for heplisav has remained in effect since march there can be no assurance as to whether heplisav can be further developed 
moreover  if heplisav can not be successfully developed  we will have to re purpose our d sseldorf facility toward alternative manufacturing or research activities that may not fully utilize the facility s capacity  resulting in continued operating costs that may not be offset by corresponding revenues 
we rely on contract research organizations to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not fulfill their contractual obligations or meet expected deadlines  our planned clinical trials may be delayed and we may fail to obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
if these third parties do not perform their obligations or meet expected deadlines our planned clinical trials may be extended  delayed or terminated 
any extension  delay or termination of our clinical trials would delay our ability to commercialize our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
if any products we develop are not accepted by the market or if regulatory agencies limit our labeling indications or marketing claims  we may be unable to generate significant revenues  if any 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and are able to successfully commercialize them  our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  health care payors and the medical community 
the fda or other regulatory agencies could limit the labeling indication for which our product candidates may be marketed or could otherwise limit marketing efforts for our products 
if we are unable to successfully market any approved product candidates  or marketing efforts are restricted by regulatory limits  our ability to generate revenues could be significantly impaired 
a key part of our business strategy is to establish collaborative relationships to commercialize and fund development of our product candidates 
we may not succeed in establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships  which may significantly limit our ability to develop and commercialize our products successfully  if at all 
we will need to establish collaborative relationships to obtain domestic and international sales  marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates 
we also intend to enter into collaborative relationships to provide funding to support our research and development programs 
the process of establishing collaborative relationships is difficult  time consuming and involves significant uncertainty 
moreover  even if we do establish collaborative relationships  our collaborators may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical results  a change in business strategy  a change of control or other reasons 
if any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner  or at all  our research  clinical development or commercialization efforts related to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated  or it may be necessary for 
table of contents us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator 
if we are unable to establish and maintain collaborative relationships on acceptable terms or to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements  we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of our product candidates  undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital 
many of our competitors have greater financial resources and expertise than we do 
if we are unable to successfully compete with existing or potential competitors despite these disadvantages we may be unable to generate revenues and our business will be harmed 
we compete with pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  academic institutions and research organizations  in developing therapies to treat or prevent infectious diseases  allergy  asthma and cancer  as well as those focusing more generally on the immune system 
competitors may develop more effective  more affordable or more convenient products or may achieve earlier patent protection or commercialization of their products 
these competitive products may render our product candidates obsolete or limit our ability to generate revenues from our product candidates 
many of the companies developing competing technologies and products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do 
existing and potential competitors may also compete with us for qualified scientific and management personnel  as well as for technology that would be advantageous to our business 
if we are unable to compete successfully  we may not be able to obtain financing  enter into collaborative arrangements  sell our product candidates or generate revenues 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel  and the loss of the services of any of our key employees would affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates and achieve our objectives 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and scientific staff  including our chief executive officer  dr 
dino dina 
we experience intense competition for qualified personnel 
our future success also depends in part on the continued service of our executive management team  key scientific and management personnel and our ability to recruit  train and retain essential scientific personnel for our drug discovery and development programs  including those who will be responsible for overseeing our preclinical testing and clinical trials as well as for the establishment of collaborations with other companies 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  our research and product development goals  including the identification and establishment of key collaborations  operations and marketing efforts could be delayed or curtailed 
we may develop  seek regulatory approval for and market our product candidates outside the united states  requiring a significant commitment of resources 
failure to successfully manage our international operations could result in significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may introduce certain of our product candidates in various markets outside the united states 
developing  seeking regulatory approval for and marketing our product candidates outside the united states could impose substantial burdens on our resources and divert management s attention from domestic operations 
international operations are subject to risk  including the difficulty of managing geographically distant operations  including recruiting and retaining qualified employees  locating adequate facilities and establishing useful business support relationships in the local community  compliance with varying international regulatory requirements  laws and treaties  securing international distribution  marketing and sales capabilities  adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  
table of contents legal uncertainties and potential timing delays associated with tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  adverse tax consequences  the fluctuation of conversion rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar  and regional and geopolitical risks 
if we are unable to successfully manage our international operations  we may incur significant unanticipated costs and delays in regulatory approval or commercialization of our product candidates  which would impair our ability to generate revenues 
we rely on our licenses from the regents of the university of california 
impairment of these licenses or our inability to maintain them would severely harm our business 
our current research and development efforts depend upon our license arrangements with the regents of the university of california  or uc 
our dependence on these licenses subjects us to numerous risks  such as disputes regarding the creation or use of intellectual property by us and uc  or scientific collaborators 
additionally  our agreements with uc generally contain diligence or milestone based termination provisions 
our failure to meet any obligations pursuant to these provisions could allow uc to terminate our agreements or convert exclusive to non exclusive licenses 
in addition  our license agreements with uc may be terminated or may expire by their terms  and we may not be able to maintain the exclusivity of these licenses 
if we cannot maintain licenses that are advantageous or necessary to the development or the commercialization of our product candidates  we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license similar technology 
if third parties successfully assert that we have infringed their patents and proprietary rights or challenge the validity of our patents and proprietary rights  we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly  time consuming  and delay or prevent development or commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe their intellectual property rights  or we may be required to enter into litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of our or another party s proprietary rights  including a challenge as to the validity of our issued and pending claims 
we are involved in various interference and other administrative proceedings related to our intellectual property which has caused us to incur certain legal expenses 
if we become involved in any litigation and or other significant interference proceedings related to our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others  we will incur substantial additional expenses and it will divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
if we or our collaborators are unsuccessful in defending or prosecuting our issued and pending claims or in defending potential claims against our products  for example  as may arise in the commercialization of heplisav or any similar product candidate in the united states  we or our collaborator could be required to pay substantial damages or be unable to commercialize our product candidates or use our proprietary technologies without a license from such third party 
a license may require the payment of substantial fees or royalties  require a grant of a cross license to our technology or may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may be required to redesign our technology so it does not infringe a third party s patents  which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time 
any of these outcomes could require us to change our business strategy and could materially impact our business and operations 
one of our potential competitors  pfizer  has issued us patent claims  as well as patent claims pending with the us patent and trademark office  or pto  that may be asserted against our iss products 
we may need to obtain a license to one or more of these patent claims held by pfizer by paying fees or royalties or offering rights to our own proprietary technologies in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of iss in the us other than with respect to heplisav 
such a license may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  which could preclude or limit our ability to commercialize our products 

table of contents if the combination of patents  trade secrets and contractual provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property is inadequate  the value of our product candidates will decrease 
our success depends on our ability to obtain and protect commercially valuable patents or the rights to patents both domestically and abroad  operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others  and prevent others from successfully challenging or infringing our proprietary rights 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use only to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we try to protect our proprietary rights by filing and prosecuting united states and foreign patent applications 
however  in certain cases such protection may be limited  depending in part on existing patents held by third parties  which may only allow us to obtain relatively narrow patent protection 
in the united states  legal standards relating to the validity and scope of patent claims in the biopharmaceutical field can be highly uncertain  are still evolving and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved 
the biopharmaceutical patent environment outside the united states is even more uncertain 
we may be particularly affected by this uncertainty since several of our product candidates may initially address market opportunities outside the united states  where we may only be able to obtain limited patent protection 
the risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other proprietary rights include the following we may not receive an issued patent for any of our patent applications or for any patent applications that we have exclusively licensed  the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents  the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection or may not be valid or enforceable  we might not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  the patents licensed or issued to us or our collaborators may not provide a competitive advantage  patents issued to other parties may limit our intellectual property protection or harm our ability to do business  other parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate our technologies and commercialize discoveries that we attempt to patent  and other parties may design around technologies we have licensed  patented or developed 
we also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests in proprietary know how that is not patentable and for processes for which patents are difficult to enforce 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to protect our trade secrets adequately 
any disclosure of confidential data in the public domain or to third parties could allow our competitors to learn our trade secrets 
if we are unable to adequately obtain or enforce proprietary rights we may be unable to commercialize our products  enter into collaborations  generate revenues or maintain any advantage we may have with respect to existing or potential competitors 
we have licensed some of our development and commercialization rights to certain of our development programs in connection with our symphony dynamo funding arrangement and will not receive any future royalties or revenues with respect to this intellectual property unless we exercise an option to repurchase some 
table of contents or all of the programs in the future 
we may not obtain sufficient clinical data in order to determine whether we should exercise our option prior to the expiration of the development period  and even if we decide to exercise  we may not have the financial resources to exercise our option in a timely manner 
in april  we granted an exclusive license to the intellectual property for certain iss compounds for cancer  hepatitis b and hepatitis c therapies development programs to symphony dynamo  inc sdi in consideration for a commitment from symphony capital partners  lp and certain of its affiliates symphony to provide million of capital to advance the development programs 
as part of the arrangement  we received an exclusive purchase option purchase option to acquire all of the development programs through the purchase of all of the equity in sdi during the five year term at specified prices ranging from million as of january   increasing quarterly up to million at the end of the five year term 
the purchase option exercise price is payable in cash or a combination of cash and shares of dynavax common stock  at our sole discretion 
we also received an exclusive option to purchase either the hepatitis b or hepatitis c program program option during the first year of the arrangement 
in april  we exercised our program option for the hepatitis b program 
the exercise of this program option triggered a payment obligation of million which will either be a due to symphony upon the expiration of the sdi collaboration in if the purchase option is not exercised  or b included as part of the applicable purchase price upon exercise of the purchase option 
the intellectual property rights to the remaining cancer and hepatitis c therapy programs not purchased through the exercise of the purchase option will remain with sdi 
we and sdi jointly manage the development programs and there can be no assurance that we will agree on various decisions that will enable us to successfully develop the potential products  or even if we are in agreement on the development plans  that the development efforts will result in sufficient clinical data to make a fully informed decision with respect to the exercise of our purchase option 
if we do not exercise the purchase option prior to its expiration  then our rights in and with respect to the development programs will terminate and we will no longer have rights to any of the programs licensed to sdi under the arrangement 
if we elect to exercise the purchase option  we will be required to make a payment of at least million  increasing thereafter quarterly  which at our discretion may be paid partially in shares of our common stock 
as a result  in order to exercise the purchase option  we will be required to make a substantial payment of cash and possibly issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock 
we do not currently have the resources to exercise the purchase option and we may be required to enter into a financing arrangement or license arrangement with one or more third parties  or some combination of these in order to exercise the purchase option  even if we paid a portion of the purchase price with our common stock 
there can be no assurance that any financing or licensing arrangement will be available or even if available  that the terms would be favorable to us and our stockholders 
we face product liability exposure  which  if not covered by insurance  could result in significant financial liability 
while we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any approved products will subject us to potential product liability claims and may raise questions about a product s safety and efficacy 
as a result  we could experience a delay in our ability to commercialize one or more of our product candidates or reduced sales of any approved product candidates 
in addition  a product liability claim may exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage in the amount of million for each occurrence for clinical trials with umbrella coverage of an additional million 
this coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available in sufficient amounts  at an acceptable cost or at all 
we also may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any product approved for marketing in the future 
a product liability claim  product recalls or other claims  as well as any claims for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities  would divert our management s attention from our business and could result in significant financial liability 

table of contents we face uncertainty related to coverage  pricing and reimbursement and the practices of third party payors  which may make it difficult or impossible to sell our product candidates on commercially reasonable terms 
in both domestic and foreign markets  our ability to achieve profitability will depend in part on the negotiation of a favorable price or the availability of appropriate reimbursement from third party payors 
existing laws affecting the pricing and coverage of pharmaceuticals and other medical products by government programs and other third party payors may change before any of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
in addition  third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
because we intend to offer products  if approved  that involve new technologies and new approaches to treating disease  the willingness of third party payors to reimburse for our products is particularly uncertain 
we will have to charge a price for our products that is sufficiently high to enable us to recover our considerable investment in product development 
adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to achieve profitability and could harm our future prospects and reduce our stock price 
we use hazardous materials in our business 
any claims or liabilities relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly to resolve 
our research and product development activities involve the controlled storage  use and disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials and biological waste 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and certain waste products 
we are currently in compliance with all government permits that are required for the storage  use and disposal of these materials 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to persons or property from these materials 
in the event of an accident related to hazardous materials  we could be held liable for damages  cleanup costs or penalized with fines  and this liability could exceed the limits of our insurance policies and exhaust our internal resources 
we may have to incur significant costs to comply with future environmental laws and regulations 
our stock price is subject to volatility  and your investment may suffer a decline in value 
the market prices for securities of biopharmaceutical companies have in the past been  and are likely to continue in the future to be  very volatile 
the market price of our common stock is subject to substantial volatility depending upon many factors  many of which are beyond our control  including progress or results of any of our clinical trials or regulatory efforts  in particular any announcements regarding the progress or results of our planned trials and communications from the fda  our ability to establish and maintain collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  technological innovations  new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors  changes in our intellectual property portfolio or developments or disputes concerning the proprietary rights of our products or product candidates  our ability to obtain component materials and successfully enter into manufacturing relationships for our product candidates or establish manufacturing capacity on our own  our ability to enter into and maintain collaborations  maintenance of our existing exclusive licensing agreements with the regents of the university of california  
table of contents changes in government regulations  general economic conditions  industry announcements  issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results  our ability to maintain continued listing on the nasdaq markets or similar exchanges  and volume of trading in our common stock one or more of these factors could cause a substantial decline in the price of our common stock 
in october  we experienced a decline in our market capitalization of nearly based on the fda s communication to us regarding the continuation of a clinical hold on two us ind applications for heplisav 
in november  we transferred our listing of dynavax shares to the nasdaq capital market from the nasdaq global market 
we may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market if our share price or market value of publicly held shares does not meet certain thresholds 
in addition  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk may be particularly relevant for us because we have experienced greater than average stock price volatility  as have other biotechnology companies in recent years 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs  and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our business  operating results and financial conditions 
the anti takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  delaware law and our share purchase rights plan may prevent or frustrate a change in control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control  discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
these provisions include authorizing our board of directors to issue additional preferred stock with voting rights to be determined by the board of directors  limiting the persons who can call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent  creating a classified board of directors pursuant to which our directors are elected for staggered three year terms  providing that a supermajority vote of our stockholders is required for amendment to certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
our recently adopted share purchase rights plan may have certain anti takeover effects 
specifically  the rights issued pursuant to the plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire the company on terms not approved by the company s board of directors 
although the rights should not interfere with any merger or other business combination approved by the board of directors since the rights issued may be amended to permit such acquisition or redeemed by the company at per right prior to the earliest of i the time that a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of or more of the common shares or ii the final expiration date of the rights  the effect of the rights plan may deter a potential acquisition of the company 
in addition  we remain subject to the provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for three years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors
