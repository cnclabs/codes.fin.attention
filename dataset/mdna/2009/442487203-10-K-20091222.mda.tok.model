item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
active selling communities communities approved homes homes delivered contracted not delivered remaining homes available northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total includes home sites under option 
of the total remaining homes available  were under construction or completed including models and sales offices   were under option 
includes four homes in backlog for communities in planning 
backlog at october  and  including unconsolidated joint ventures  we had a backlog of signed contracts for  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating billion and billion  respectively 
the majority of our backlog at october  is expected to be completed and closed within the next months 
at november  and  our backlog of signed contracts  including unconsolidated joint ventures  was  homes and  homes  respectively  with sales values aggregating billion and billion  respectively 
sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract that provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to days after execution 
this contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing 
in addition  in the northeast  mid atlantic  and some sections of the southeast  we typically obtain an additional to down payment due within to days after signing 
the contract may include a financing contingency  which permits the customers to cancel their obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates including financing arranged or provided by us is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period typically is four to eight weeks following the date of execution 
when housing values decline in certain markets  some customers cancel their contracts and forfeit their deposits 
cancellation rates are discussed further in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales contracts are included in backlog once the sales contract is signed by the customer  which in some cases includes contracts that are in the rescission or cancellation periods 
however  revenues from sales of homes are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  when title to the home is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investment have been received and there is no continued involvement 
residential land inventory in planning it is our objective to control a supply of land  primarily through options  consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets 
controlled land as of october   exclusive of communities under development described above under active selling communities and excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  is summarized in the following table 
the proposed developable home sites in communities under development are included in the  consolidated total home sites under the total residential real estate chart in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
communities in planning dollars in thousands number of proposed communities proposed developable home sites total land option price book value northeast under option owned total mid atlantic under option owned total midwest under option owned total southeast under option owned total southwest under option owned total west under option owned total totals under option owned combined total properties under option also include costs incurred on properties not under option but which are under evaluation 
for properties under option  as of october   option fees and deposits aggregated approximately million 
as of october   we spent an additional million in non refundable predevelopment costs on such properties 
the book value of million included the amount on the consolidated balance sheets identified as inventories land and land options held for future development or sale  as well as million for specific performance options  and million for other options reported under consolidated inventory not owned 
we either option or acquire improved or unimproved home sites from land developers or other sellers 
under a typical agreement with the land developer  we purchase a minimal number of home sites 
the balance of the home sites to be purchased is covered under an option agreement or a non recourse purchase agreement 
as a result of the declining homebuilding market  we have decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities for which we have determined that the current performance does not justify further investment at this time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on mothballed communities 
for additional financial information regarding our homebuilding segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
competition our homebuilding operations are highly competitive 
we are among the top homebuilders in the united states in both homebuilding revenues and home deliveries 
we compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate 
our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly owned builders and developers  some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do 
previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition 
we compete primarily on the basis of reputation  price  location  design  quality  service  and amenities 
regulation and environmental matters we are subject to various local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules  and regulations concerning zoning  building design  construction  and similar matters  including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality 
in addition  we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction  advertisement  and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained 
we may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate 
generally  such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity 
in addition  some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved  and others may approve  slow growth or no growth initiatives that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas 
approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements  which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets 
any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state  federal  and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment environmental laws 
the particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions  and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation  and or other costs  and prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities  we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretation and application 
item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks in addition to the other information included in this form k 
the homebuilding industry is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  real estate markets  and weather conditions  which could affect our ability to build homes at prices our customers are willing or able to pay  could reduce profits that may not be recaptured  could result in cancellation of sales contracts  and could affect our liquidity 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical  has from time to time experienced significant difficulties  and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions such as employment levels and job growth  availability of financing for home buyers  interest rates  foreclosure rates  inflation  adverse changes in tax laws  consumer confidence  housing demand  and population growth 
turmoil in the financial markets could affect our liquidity 
in addition  our cash balances are primarily invested in short term government backed instruments 
the remaining cash balances are held at numerous financial institutions and may  at times  exceed insurable amounts 
we believe we help to mitigate this risk by depositing our cash in major financial institutions and diversifying our investments 
in addition  our homebuilding operations often require us to obtain letters of credit 
in connection with the issuance of our senior secured first lien notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our revolving credit facility and refinanced the borrowing capacity thereunder 
in addition  we entered into certain stand alone letter of credit facilities  and agreements pursuant to which all of the outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility were replaced with letters of credit issued under such new letter of credit facilities and agreements 
however  we will likely need additional letters of credit above the amounts provided under these new letter of credit facilities and agreements 
if we are unable to obtain such additional letters of credit as needed to operate our business  we may be adversely affected 
weather conditions and natural disasters such as hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  floods  and fires can harm the local homebuilding business 
our business in florida was adversely affected in late and into due to the impact of hurricane wilma on materials and labor availability and pricing 
conversely  hurricane ike  which hit houston in september  did not have an impact on materials and labor availability or pricing  but did impact the volume of home sales in subsequent weeks 
the difficulties described above could cause us to take longer and incur more costs to build our homes 
we may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because we fix our prices up to months in advance of delivery by signing home sales contracts 
in addition  some home buyers may cancel or not honor their home sales contracts altogether 
the homebuilding industry is undergoing a significant and sustained downturn which has  and could continue to  materially and adversely affect our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
the homebuilding industry is now experiencing a significant and sustained downturn 
an industry wide softening of demand for new homes has resulted from a lack of consumer confidence  decreased housing affordability  decreased availability of mortgage financing  and large supplies of resale and new home inventories 
in addition  an oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties  resale homes  and foreclosures  has depressed prices and reduced margins for the sale of new homes 
industry conditions had a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations during fiscal years   and and are continuing to materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in fiscal further  we substantially increased our inventory through fiscal  which required significant cash outlays and which has increased our price and margin exposure as we continue to work through this inventory 
although our absorption rate per community is stabilizing or even increasing  we expect our aggregate net sales to continue to decline due to the further reduction of active communities as we deliver our final homes therein without replacements at an equivalent rate 
looking forward  given the continued deterioration in the housing market  it will become more difficult to generate positive cash flow 
general economic conditions in the us remain weak 
market volatility has been unprecedented and extraordinary in the last months  and the resulting economic turmoil may continue to exacerbate industry conditions or have other unforeseen consequences  leading to uncertainty about future conditions in the homebuilding industry 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence  stabilize the markets  or increase liquidity and the availability of credit  or whether any such results will be sustainable 
continuation or worsening of this downturn or general economic conditions would continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  liquidity  and results of operations 
the housing market has benefited from a number of government programs  including tax credits for home buyers provided by the federal government and certain state governments  including california  and support of the mortgage market  including through purchases of mortgage backed securities by the federal reserve bank and the underwriting of a substantial amount of new mortgages by the federal housing administration fha and other governmental agencies 
these programs are expected to wind down over time  for example the california tax credit ended recently and the federal tax credit is scheduled to expire in april in addition  recent remarks from the us department of housing and urban development hud secretary suggest that fha underwriting standards may be tightened 
we cannot assure that the housing markets will not decline further as these programs are ended 
leverage places burdens on our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness  may restrict our ability to operate  may prevent us from fulfilling our obligations  and may adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt 
our debt  as of october   including the debt of the subsidiaries that guarantee our debt  was  million  million net of discount  and our debt service payments for the month period ended october   which include interest incurred and mandatory principal payments on our corporate debt under the terms of our indentures but which do not include principal and interest on non recourse secured debt and debt of our financial subsidiaries  were million 
in addition  as of october   we had million in aggregate outstanding face amount of letters of credit issued under various letter of credit facilities and agreements  which were collateralized by million of restricted cash 
we also had substantial contractual commitments and contingent obligations  including approximately million of performance bonds as of october  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual obligations 
our significant amount of debt could have important consequences 
for example  it could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  or other requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our debt and reduce our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business  place us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt than some of our competitors  and make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business and general economic conditions 
our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations will depend upon our future performance 
we are engaged in businesses that are substantially affected by changes in economic cycles 
our revenues and earnings vary with the level of general economic activity in the markets we serve 
our businesses are also affected by customer sentiment and financial  political  business  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors that affect our ability to generate cash can also affect our ability to raise additional funds for these purposes through the sale of equity securities  the refinancing of debt  or the sale of assets 
changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations to the extent we have any floating rate indebtedness 
a higher interest rate on our debt service obligations could result in lower earnings or increased losses 
our sources of liquidity are limited and may not be sufficient to meet our needs in connection with the issuance of our senior secured first lien notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our revolving credit facility and refinanced the borrowing capacity thereunder 
because we no longer have a revolving credit facility  we are dependent on our current cash balance and future cash flows from operations which may not be positive to enable us to service our indebtedness  to cover our operating expenses  and or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity  which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness  we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures  or to sell assets  seek additional capital  or restructure our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our debt service obligations 
we have also entered into certain cash collateralized letter of credit agreements and facilities that require us to maintain specified amounts of cash in segregated accounts as collateral to support our letters of credit issued thereunder  which will affect the amount of cash we have available for other uses 
if our available cash and capital resources are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations 
we may not be able to consummate those dispositions  or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may restrict our ability to operate and if our financial performance worsens  we may not be able to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our debt instruments 
the indentures governing our outstanding debt securities impose certain restrictions on our operations and activities 
the most significant restrictions relate to debt incurrence  sales of assets  cash distributions  including paying dividends on common and preferred stock  capital stock and debt repurchases  and investments by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
because of these restrictions  we are currently prohibited from paying dividends on our preferred stock and anticipate that we will remain prohibited for the foreseeable future 
if we fail to comply with any of the restrictions or covenants of our debt instruments  and are unable to amend the instrument or obtain a waiver  or make timely payments on this debt and other material indebtedness  the trustees under the indentures governing our debt instruments could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity 
in such a situation  there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain alternative financing 
either situation could have a material adverse effect on the solvency of the company 
the terms of our debt instruments allow us to incur additional indebtedness 
under the terms of our indebtedness under our indentures  we have the ability  subject to our debt covenants  to incur additional amounts of debt 
the incurrence of additional indebtedness could magnify the risks described above 
in addition  certain obligations such as standby letters of credit and performance bonds issued in the ordinary course of business  including those issued under our stand alone letter of credit agreements and facilities  are not considered indebtedness under our indentures and may be secured  and therefore  are not subject to limits in our debt covenants 
we could be adversely affected by a negative change in our credit rating 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms is a key factor in our ability to service our indebtedness to cover our operating expenses  and to fund our other liquidity needs 
on march   fitch lowered the company s issuer default rating to ccc from b 
on april   moody s affirmed our corporate family rating of caa  with a negative outlook 
on april   s p lowered our b corporate credit rating to ccc  with a negative outlook 
on october   s p raised our corporate credit rating to ccc from ccc and revised our outlook to developing from negative 
downgrades may make it more difficult and costly for us to access capital  therefore  any further downgrade by any of the principal credit agencies may exacerbate these difficulties 
our business is seasonal in nature and our quarterly operating results can fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results generally fluctuate by season 
historically  a large percentage of our agreements of sale have been entered into in the winter and spring 
the construction of a customer s home typically begins after signing the agreement of sale and can take months or more to complete 
weather related problems  typically in the late winter and early spring  can delay starts or closings and increase costs and thus reduce profitability 
in addition  delays in opening communities could have an adverse impact on our sales and revenues 
due to these factors  our quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate 
our success depends on the availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices and our having sufficient liquidity to fund such investments 
our success in developing land and in building and selling homes depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable undeveloped land and improved lots at acceptable prices 
the availability of undeveloped land and improved lots for purchase at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control  including the risk of competitive over bidding on land and lots and restrictive governmental regulation 
should suitable land opportunities become less available  the number of homes we may be able to build and sell would be reduced  which would reduce revenue and profits 
in addition  our ability to make land purchases will depend upon us having sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases 
we may be at a disadvantage in competing for land due to our significant debt obligations  which require substantial cash resources 
raw material and labor shortages and price fluctuations could delay or increase the cost of home construction and adversely affect our operating results 
the homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages 
in particular  shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of  or increase the cost of  developing one or more of our residential communities 
in addition  we contract with subcontractors to construct our homes 
therefore  the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability  skill  and cost of our subcontractors 
delays or cost increases caused by shortages and price fluctuations could harm our operating results  the impact of which may be further affected depending on our ability to raise sales prices 
changes in economic and market conditions could result in the sale of homes at a loss or holding land in inventory longer than planned  the cost of which can be significant 
land inventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders 
we must continuously seek and make acquisitions of land for expansion into new markets and for replacement and expansion of land inventory within our current markets 
the market value of undeveloped land  buildable lots  and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and market conditions 
in the event of significant changes in economic or market conditions  we may have to sell homes at a loss or hold land in inventory longer than planned 
in the case of land options  we could choose not to exercise them  in which case we would write off the value of these options 
inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing project or market 
the assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
see critical accounting policies 
for example  during   and  we decided not to exercise many option contracts and walked away from land option deposits and predevelopment costs  which resulted in land option write offs of million  million and million  respectively 
also  in   and  as a result of the difficult market conditions  we recorded inventory impairment losses on owned property of million  million  and million  respectively 
if market conditions continue to worsen  additional inventory impairment losses and land option write offs will likely be necessary 
home prices and sales activities in the california  new jersey  texas  virginia  and maryland markets have a large impact on our results of operations because we conduct a significant portion of our business in these markets 
we presently conduct a significant portion of our business in the california  new jersey  texas  virginia  and maryland markets 
home prices and sales activities in these markets  and in most of the other markets in which we operate  have declined from time to time  particularly as a result of slow economic growth 
in particular  california  new jersey  virginia  and maryland have declined significantly since the end of furthermore  precarious economic and budget situations at the state government level may adversely affect the market for our homes in those affected areas 
if home prices and sales activity decline in one or more of the markets in which we operate  our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and may negatively impact our results of operations 
because almost all of our customers require mortgage financing  increases in interest rates or the decreased availability of mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes  lower demand for our products  limit our marketing effectiveness  and limit our ability to fully realize our backlog 
virtually all of our customers finance their acquisitions through lenders providing mortgage financing 
increases in interest rates or decreases in availability of mortgage financing could lower demand for new homes because of the increased monthly mortgage costs to potential home buyers 
even if potential customers do not need financing  changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing 
this could prevent or limit our ability to attract new customers as well as our ability to fully realize our backlog because our sales contracts generally include a financing contingency 
financing contingencies permit the customer to cancel his obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates  including financing arranged or provided by us  is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period is typically four to eight weeks following the date of execution of the sales contract 
over the last several quarters  many lenders have significantly tightened their underwriting standards  and many subprime and other alternative mortgage products are no longer being made available in the marketplace 
if these trends continue and mortgage loans continue to be difficult to obtain  the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes will be adversely affected  which will adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  we believe that the availability of mortgage financing  including federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corp  and fha va financing  is an important factor in marketing many of our homes 
recently  remarks from the hud secretary suggest that fha underwriting standards may be tightened 
any limitations or restrictions on the availability of those types of financing could reduce our sales 
we conduct certain of our operations through unconsolidated joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid 
we currently operate through a number of unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures with independent third parties in which we do not have a controlling interest 
at october   we had invested an aggregate of million in these joint ventures  which had borrowings outstanding of approximately million 
in addition  as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to evaluate additional joint venture opportunities 
these investments involve risks and are highly illiquid 
there are a limited number of sources willing to provide acquisition  development  and construction financing to land development and homebuilding joint ventures  and as market conditions become more challenging  it may be difficult or impossible to obtain financing for our joint ventures on commercially reasonable terms 
recently  we have been unable to obtain financing for newly created joint ventures 
in addition  we lack a controlling interest in these joint ventures  and therefore  are usually unable to require that our joint ventures sell assets or return invested capital  make additional capital contributions  or take any other action without the vote of at least one of our venture partners 
therefore  absent partner agreement  we will be unable to liquidate our joint venture investments to generate cash 
homebuilders are subject to a number of federal  local  state  and foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of land  the homebuilding  sales  and customer financing processes and protection of the environment  which can cause us to incur delays and costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict our activity in some regions or areas 
we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and home building  sales  and customer financing processes  including zoning  density  building standards  and mortgage financing 
these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 
in light of recent developments in the home building industry and the financial markets  federal  state  or local governments may seek to adopt regulations that limit or prohibit homebuilders from providing mortgage financing to their customers 
if adopted  any such regulations could adversely affect future revenues and earnings 
in addition  some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved  and others may approve  slow growth or no growth initiatives that could negatively impact the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas 
approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements  which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets 
any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state  federal  and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions  and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation  and or other costs  and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
for example  during  we received two requests for information pursuant to section of the clean water act from region of the environmental protection agency the epa 
these requests sought information concerning storm water discharge practices in connection with completed  ongoing  and planned homebuilding projects by subsidiaries in the states and district that comprise epa region we also received a notice of violations for one project in pennsylvania and requests for sampling plan implementation in two projects in pennsylvania 
we have subsequently received notification from the epa alleging violations of storm water discharge practices at other locations and requesting related information 
we provided the epa with information in response to its requests 
the department of justice doj is also involved in the review of these practices and enforcement with respect to them 
we are engaged in discussions with the doj and epa regarding a resolution of these matters  which we anticipate will include a monetary fine and an agreement to implement certain operational and training measures nationwide to ensure ongoing compliance with storm water regulations 
although we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material costs in excess of the amount we have reserved for this matter  we cannot predict whether our discussions with the doj and epa will result in a resolution  or what any resolution of these matters ultimately will require of us 
we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretation and application 
product liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly 
as a homebuilder  we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
such claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
in addition  the amount and scope of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited  and this coverage may be further restricted and become more costly 
if we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against such claims  we may experience losses that could hurt our financial results 
our financial results could also be adversely affected if we were to experience an unusually high number of claims or unusually severe claims 
recently  other homebuilders in florida have had construction defect claims associated with allegedly defective drywall manufactured in china chinese drywall that may be responsible for noxious smells and accelerated corrosion of certain metals in the home 
we have identified only homes with this potential issue  however  if additional homes are identified to have this issue  or our actual costs to remediate differ from our current estimated costs  it may require us to revise our warranty reserves 
we compete on several levels with homebuilders that may have greater sales and financial resources  which could hurt future earnings 
we compete not only for home buyers but also for desirable properties  financing  raw materials  and skilled labor often within larger subdivisions designed  planned  and developed by other homebuilders 
our competitors include other local  regional  and national homebuilders  some of which have greater sales and financial resources 
the competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry together with current market conditions have  and could continue to  result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  increased selling incentives  lower sales  or delays in construction 
any of these problems could increase costs and or lower profit margins 
we may have difficulty in obtaining the additional financing required to operate and develop our business 
our operations require significant amounts of cash  and we may be required to seek additional capital  whether from sales of equity or borrowing additional money  for the future growth and development of our business 
the terms or availability of additional capital is uncertain 
moreover  the indentures for our outstanding debt securities contain provisions that restrict the debt we may incur and the equity we may issue in the future 
if we are not successful in obtaining sufficient capital  it could reduce our sales and may hinder our future growth and results of operations 
in addition  pledging substantially all of our assets to support our first  second  and third lien senior secured notes may make it more difficult to raise additional financing in the future 
our future growth may include additional acquisitions of companies that may not be successfully integrated and may not achieve expected benefits 
acquisitions of companies have contributed to our historical growth and may again be a component of our growth strategy in the future 
in the future  we may acquire businesses  some of which may be significant 
as a result of acquisitions of companies  we may need to seek additional financing and integrate product lines  dispersed operations  and distinct corporate cultures 
these integration efforts may not succeed or may distract our management from operating our existing business 
additionally  we may not be able to enhance our earnings as a result of acquisitions 
our failure to successfully identify and manage future acquisitions could harm our operating results 
our controlling stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over us 
members of the hovnanian family  including ara k 
hovnanian  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  have voting control  through personal holdings and family owned entities  of class a and class b common stock that enables them to cast approximately of the votes that may be cast by the holders of our outstanding class a and class b common stock combined 
their combined stock ownership enables them to exert significant control over us  including power to control the election of our board of directors and to approve matters presented to our stockholders 
this concentration of ownership may also make some transactions  including mergers or other changes in control  more difficult or impossible without their support 
also  because of their combined voting power  circumstances may occur in which their interests could be in conflict with the interests of other stakeholders 
our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 
based on recent impairments and our current financial performance  we generated a federal net operating loss carryforward of billion through the year ended october   and we may generate net operating loss carryforwards in future years 
section of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change  which is generally any change in ownership of more than of its stock over a three year period  to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain built in losses recognized in years after the ownership change 
these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company 
if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section as a result of future transactions involving our common stock  including purchases or sales of stock between shareholders  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and to recognize certain built in losses would be subject to the limitations of section depending on the resulting limitation  a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 
our inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in august  we announced that our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to preserve shareholder value and the value of certain tax assets primarily associated with net loss carryforwards and built in losses under section of the internal revenue code and on december   our stockholders approved the board of directors decision to adopt the shareholder rights plan 
in addition  on december   our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to restrict certain transfers of class a common stock in order to preserve the tax treatment of our net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses under section of the internal revenue code 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
utility shortages and outages or rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in prior years  the areas in which we operate in california have experienced power shortages  including periods without electrical power  as well as significant fluctuations in utility costs 
we may incur additional costs and may not be able to complete construction on a timely basis if such power shortages outages and utility rate fluctuations continue 
furthermore  power shortages and outages  such as the blackout that occurred in in the northeast  and rate fluctuations may adversely affect the regional economies in which we operate  which may reduce demand for our homes 
our operations may be adversely affected if further rate fluctuations and or power shortages and outages occur in california  the northeast  or in our other markets 
geopolitical risks and market disruption could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
geopolitical events  such as the aftermath of the war with iraq and the continuing involvement in iraq and afghanistan  may have a substantial impact on the economy and the housing market 
the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon on september  had an impact on our business and the occurrence of similar events in the future cannot be ruled out 
the war and the continuing involvement in iraq and afghanistan  terrorism  and related geopolitical risks have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may have additional material adverse effects on the us economy  and our customers and  in turn  our results of operations and financial condition

item properties we own a  square foot office complex located in the northeast that serves as our corporate headquarters 
we own  square feet of office and warehouse space throughout the midwest 
we lease approximately  square feet of space for our segments located in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  southeast  southwest  and west 
item legal proceedings we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations  and we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and home building  sales  and customer financing processes  including zoning  density  building standards  and mortgage financing 
these regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the cost of development or homebuilding 
we also are subject to a variety of local  state  federal  and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment 
the particular environmental laws that apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance  remediation and or other costs  and can prohibit or severely restrict development and homebuilding activity 
in march  we received two requests for information pursuant to section of the clean water act from region of the epa 
these requests sought information concerning storm water discharge practices in connection with completed  ongoing and planned homebuilding projects by subsidiaries in the states and district that comprise epa region we also received a notice of violations for one project in pennsylvania and requests for sampling plan implementation in two projects in pennsylvania 
we have subsequently received notification from the epa alleging violations of storm water discharge practices at other locations and requesting related information 
we provided the epa with information in response to its requests 
the doj is also involved in the review of these practices and enforcement with respect to them 
we are engaged in discussions with the doj and epa regarding a resolution of these matters  which we anticipate will include a monetary fine and an agreement to implement certain operational and training measures nationwide to ensure ongoing compliance with storm water regulations 
although we do not currently anticipate that we will incur any material costs in excess of the amount we have reserved for this matter  we cannot predict whether our discussions with the doj and epa will result in a resolution  or what any resolution of these matters ultimately will require of us 
we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures  which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules  and regulations and their interpretations and application

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations beginning during the second half of our fiscal year ended october  and continuing through today  the us housing market has been impacted by a lack of consumer confidence  increasing home foreclosure rates and large supplies of resale and new home inventories 
the result has been weakened demand for new homes  slower sales  higher than normal cancellation rates until recently  and increased price discounts and other sales incentives to attract homebuyers 
additionally  the availability of certain mortgage financing products became more constrained starting in february when the mortgage industry began to more closely scrutinize subprime  alt a  and other non prime mortgage products 
the overall economy has weakened significantly and fears of a prolonged recession are pronounced due to rising unemployment levels  further deterioration in consumer confidence and the reduction in extensions of credit and consumer spending 
as a result  we have experienced significant decreases in our revenues and gross margins during   and compared with prior years 
additionally  we incurred total land related impairment charges of million  million and million for the years ended october   and  respectively 
these charges resulted from the write off of deposit and preacquisition costs of million  million and million  respectively  related to land we no longer plan to pursue and impairments on owned inventory of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended october    and  respectively 
in addition to land related charges  the continued weakening of the market resulted in impairments of our finite lived intangible assets and goodwill of zero  million and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
we have exposure to additional impairments of our inventories  which  as of october   have a book value of billion  net of million of impairments recorded on of our communities 
we also have million invested in  lots under option  including cash and letters of credit option deposits of million as of october  we will record a write off for the amounts associated with an option if we determine it is probable we will not exercise it 
as of october   we have total investments in  and advances to  unconsolidated joint ventures of million 
each of our joint ventures assesses its inventory and other long lived assets for impairment and we separately assess our investment in joint ventures for recoverability  which has resulted in total reductions in our investment in joint ventures of million from the second half of fiscal  the first quarter in which we had impairments on our joint ventures  through october  we still have exposure to future write downs of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures if conditions continue to deteriorate in the markets in which our joint ventures operate 
with respect to goodwill and intangibles  there is no remaining risk of further exposure to impairments because both goodwill and finite lived intangibles have been fully written off as of october  during fiscal  we continued to operate our business with the expectation that difficult market conditions would continue to impact us for the foreseeable future 
we adjusted our approach to land acquisition and construction practices and continued to shorten our land pipeline  reduce production volumes  and balance home price and profitability with sales pace 
we delayed and cancelled planned land purchases and renegotiated land prices and significantly reduced our total number of controlled lots owned and under option 
additionally  we significantly reduced the number of speculative homes put into production 
we have recently begun to see more opportunities to purchase land at prices that make economic sense in light of the current sales prices and sales paces  therefore in  we plan to pursue land when it makes strategic and economic sense to do so 
new land purchases at pricing that will generate good investment returns are needed to return to profitability 
during  we also evaluated and made reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses  including corporate general and administrative expenses  reducing these expenses million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due in large part to a reduction in head count at the end of fiscal from our peak in june given the persistence of difficult market conditions  improving the efficiency of our selling  general  and administrative expenses will continue to be a significant area of focus 
for the year ended october   homebuilding selling  general and administrative costs declined to million compared to the year ended october  corporate general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended october  include million related to the election by the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  non executive members of the board of directors  and other senior executives of the company  to cancel certain stock options during fiscal excluding this charge  corporate general and administrative expenses would have declined to million  compared to year ended october  critical accounting policies management believes that the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements effective july   the financial accounting standards board fasb established the accounting standards codification asc as the primary source of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
although the establishment of the asc did not change us gaap  it did change the way we refer to us gaap throughout this document to reflect the updated referencing convention 
income recognition from home and land sales we are primarily engaged in the development  construction  marketing and sale of residential single family and multi family homes where the planned construction cycle is less than months 
for these homes  in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment real estate sales asc  revenue is recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investments have been received  and there is no continued involvement 
in situations where the buyer s financing is originated by our mortgage subsidiary and the buyer has not made an adequate initial investment or continuing investment as prescribed by asc  the profit on such sales is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third party investor has been completed 
additionally  in certain markets  we sell lots to customers  transferring title  collecting proceeds  and entering into contracts to build homes on these lots 
in these cases  we do not recognize the revenue from the lot sale until we deliver the completed home and have no continued involvement related to that home 
the cash received on the lot is recorded as a reduction of inventory until the revenue is recognized 
income recognition from mid rise buildings when we develop mid rise buildings  they often take more than months to complete 
if these buildings qualify  revenues and costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting in accordance with asc under the percentage of completion method  revenues and costs are to be recognized when construction is beyond the preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of having a sufficient initial and continuing investment that the buyer cannot require to be refunded except for non delivery of the home  sufficient homes in the building have been sold to ensure that the property will not be converted to rental property  the sales prices are collectible  and the aggregate sales proceeds and the total cost of the building can be reasonably estimated 
we currently do not have any buildings that meet these criteria 
therefore  the revenues from delivering homes in mid rise buildings are recognized when title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate initial and continuing investment have been received  and there is no continued involvement with respect to that home 
income recognition from mortgage loans our financial services segment originates mortgages  primarily for our homebuilding customers 
we use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities mbs to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
we elected the fair value option for our loans held for sale for mortgage loans originated subsequent to october  in accordance with asc  financial instruments  which permits us to measure our loans held for sale at fair value 
management believes that the election of the fair value option for loans held for sale improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
in addition  we adopted staff accounting bulletin on february   requiring the recognition of the fair value of our rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower 
the fair value of these servicing rights is included in loans held for sale 
prior to february   the fair value of the servicing rights was not recognized until the related loan was sold 
fair value of the servicing rights is determined based on values in the company s servicing sales contracts 
substantially all of the loans originated are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  non recourse basis although the company remains liable for certain limited representations and warranties related to loan sales 
there were  however  million of mortgage loans held for investment at october   which represent loans that cannot currently be sold at reasonable terms in the secondary mortgage market 
loans held for investment are carried at cost  net of unamortized discounts and any allowance for loan losses 
profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans held for investment are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer of the mortgage and the sales price is collected 
inventories inventories consist of land  land development  home construction costs  capitalized interest and construction overhead 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then charged to cost of sales equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in each product type 
we record inventories in our consolidated balance sheets at cost unless the inventory is determined to be impaired  in which case the inventory is written down to its fair value 
our inventories consist of the following three components sold and unsold homes and lots under development  which includes all construction  land  capitalized interest  and land development costs related to started homes and land under development in our active communities  land and land options held for future development or sale  which includes all costs related to land in our communities in planning or mothballed communities  and consolidated inventory not owned  which includes all cost related to specific performance options  variable interest entities  and other options  which consists primarily of our model homes and inventory related to structured lot options 
as a result of the declining homebuilding market  we have decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities where we determine the current performance does not justify further investment at this time 
when we decide to mothball a community  the inventory is reclassified from sold and unsold homes and lots under development to land and land options held for future development or sale 
as of october   the book value associated with the mothballed communities was million  net of an impairment balance of million 
we continually review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate 
the recoverability of inventories and other long lived assets are assessed in accordance with the provisions of asc  property  plant and equipment overall asc 
asc requires long lived assets  including inventories  held for development to be evaluated for impairment based on undiscounted future cash flows of the assets at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
as such  we evaluate inventories for impairment at the individual community level  the lowest level of discrete cash flows that we measure 
we evaluate inventories of communities under development and held for future development for impairment when indicators of potential impairment are present 
indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  decreases in local housing market values  decreases in gross margins or sales absorption rates  decreases in net sales prices base sales price net of sales incentives  or actual or projected operating or cash flow losses 
the assessment of communities for indication of impairment is performed quarterly  primarily by completing detailed budgets for all of our communities and identifying those communities with a projected operating loss for any projected fiscal year or for the entire projected community life 
for those communities with projected losses  we estimate the remaining undiscounted future cash flows and compare those to the carrying value of the community  to determine if the carrying value of the asset is recoverable 
the projected operating profits  losses  or cash flows of each community can be significantly impacted by our estimates of the following future base selling prices  future home sales incentives  future home construction and land development costs  and future sales absorption pace and cancellation rates 
these estimates are dependent upon specific market conditions for each community 
while we consider available information to determine what we believe to be our best estimates as of the end of a quarterly reporting period  these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods as facts and circumstances change 
local market specific conditions that may impact our estimates for a community include the intensity of competition within a market  including available home sales prices and home sales incentives offered by our competitors  the current sales absorption pace for both our communities and competitor communities  community specific attributes  such as location  availability of lots in the market  desirability and uniqueness of our community  and the size and style of homes currently being offered  potential for alternative product offerings to respond to local market conditions  changes by management in the sales strategy of the community  and current local market economic and demographic conditions and related trends and forecasts 
these and other local market specific conditions that may be present are considered by management in preparing projection assumptions for each community 
the sales objectives can differ between our communities  even within a given market 
for example  facts and circumstances in a given community may lead us to price our homes with the objective of yielding a higher sales absorption pace  while facts and circumstances in another community may lead us to price our homes to minimize deterioration in our gross margins  although it may result in a slower sales absorption pace 
in addition  the key assumptions included in our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows may be interrelated 
for example  a decrease in estimated base sales price or an increase in homes sales incentives may result in a corresponding increase in sales absorption pace 
additionally  a decrease in the average sales price of homes to be sold and closed in future reporting periods for one community that has not been generating what management believes to be an adequate sales absorption pace may impact the estimated cash flow assumptions of a nearby community 
changes in our key assumptions  including estimated construction and development costs  absorption pace and selling strategies  could materially impact future cash flow and fair value estimates 
due to the number of possible scenarios that would result from various changes in these factors  we do not believe it is possible to develop a sensitivity analysis with a level of precision that would be meaningful to an investor 
if the undiscounted cash flows are more than the carrying value of the community  then the carrying amount is recoverable  and no impairment adjustment is required 
however  if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  then the community is deemed impaired and is written down to its fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of each community by determining the present value of the estimated future cash flows at a discount rate commensurate with the risk of the respective community 
our discount rates used for all impairments recorded from october  to date range from to 
the estimated future cash flow assumptions are the same for both our recoverability and fair value assessments 
should the estimates or expectations used in determining estimated cash flows or fair value  including discount rates  decrease or differ from current estimates in the future  we may be required to recognize additional impairments related to current and future communities 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a relative value basis 
inventories held for sale  which are land parcels where we have decided not to build homes  are a very small portion of our total inventories  and are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
in determining the fair value less the cost to sell of land held for sale  management considers  among other things  prices for land in recent comparable sale transactions  market analysis studies that include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land other than in a forced liquidation sale and recent bona fide offers received from outside third parties  if available 
from time to time  we write off deposits and approval  engineering and capitalized interest costs when we determine that it is no longer probable that we will exercise options to buy land in specific locations or when we redesign communities and or abandon certain engineering costs 
in deciding not to exercise a land option  we take into consideration changes in market conditions  the timing of required land takedowns  the willingness of land sellers to modify terms of the land option contract including timing of land takedowns  and the availability and best use of our capital  among other factors 
the write off is recorded in the period it is deemed probable that the optioned property will not be acquired 
in certain instances  we have been able to recover deposits and other pre acquisition costs that were previously written off 
these recoveries have not been significant 
the impairment of communities under development and held for future development and inventories held for sale  and the charge for land option write offs  are reflected on the consolidated statement of operations in a separate line entitled homebuilding inventory impairment loss and land option write offs 
see also results of operations and note to the consolidated financial statements for inventory impairment and land option write off amounts by segment 
insurance deductible reserves for homes delivered in fiscal and  our deductible is million per occurrence with an aggregate million for liability claims and an aggregate million for construction defect claims under our general liability insurance 
our worker s compensation insurance deductible is million per occurrence in fiscal and reserves for estimated losses for fiscal and have been established using the assistance of a third party actuary 
we engage a third party actuary that uses our historical warranty data to assist our management to estimate our unpaid claims  claim adjustment expenses and incurred but not reported claims reserves for the risks that we are assuming under the general liability and workers compensation programs 
the estimates include provisions for inflation  claims handling and legal fees 
these estimates are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build  claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations  among others 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated liability amounts  actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
interest in accordance with asc  interest capitalization of interest  interest attributable to properties under development during the land development and home construction period is capitalized and expensed along with the associated cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
interest incurred in excess of interest capitalized  which occurs when assets qualifying for interest capitalization are less than our outstanding debt balances  is expensed as incurred in other interest 
land options costs incurred to obtain options to acquire improved or unimproved home sites are capitalized 
such amounts are either included as part of the purchase price if the land is acquired or charged to operations if we determine we will not exercise the option 
if the options are with variable interest entities and we are the primary beneficiary  we record the land under option on the consolidated balance sheets under consolidated inventory not owned with an offset under liabilities from inventory not owned and minority interest from inventory not owned 
if the option obligation is to purchase under specific performance or has terms that require us to record it as financing  then we record the option on the consolidated balance sheets under consolidated inventory not owned with an offset under liabilities from inventory not owned 
in accordance with asc  consolidation overall asc  we record costs associated with other options on the consolidated balance sheets under land and land options held for future development or sale 
unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures investments in unconsolidated homebuilding and land development joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  we recognize our proportionate share of earnings and losses earned by the joint venture upon the delivery of lots or homes to third parties 
our ownership interest in joint ventures varies but is generally less than or equal to 
in determining whether or not we must consolidate joint ventures where we are the managing member of the joint venture  we assess whether the other partners have specific rights to overcome the presumption of control by us as the manager of the joint venture 
in most cases  the presumption is overcome because the joint venture agreements require that both partners agree on establishing the significant operating and capital decisions of the partnership  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
the evaluation of whether or not we control a venture can require significant judgment 
in accordance with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures overall asc  we assess our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for recoverability  and if it is determined that a loss in value of the investment is other than temporary  we write down the investment to its fair value 
we evaluate our equity investments for impairment based on the joint venture s projected cash flows 
this process requires significant management judgment and estimate 
during fiscal and  we wrote down certain joint venture investments by million and million  respectively 
there were no write downs in fiscal post development completion and warranty costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work 
in addition  we estimate and accrue warranty costs as part of cost of sales for repair costs under  per occurrence to homes  community amenities and land development infrastructure 
in addition  we accrue for warranty costs over  per occurrence as part of our general liability insurance deductible expensed as selling  general  and administrative costs 
warranty accruals require our management to make significant estimates about the cost of future claims 
both of these liabilities are recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes or income tax benefits are provided for temporary differences between amounts recorded for financial reporting and for income tax purposes 
if the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with asc  income taxes overall asc  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
see total taxes below under results of operations for further discussion of the valuation allowances 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a liability that is materially different from our current estimate 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
capital resources and liquidity our operations consist primarily of residential housing development and sales in the northeast new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  the midwest illinois  kentucky  minnesota  ohio  the mid atlantic delaware  maryland  virginia  west virginia  washington dc  the southeast florida  georgia  north carolina  south carolina  the southwest arizona  texas  and the west california 
in addition  we provide financial services to our homebuilding customers 
our cash uses during the months ended october  and were for operating expenses  land purchases  land deposits  construction spending  state income taxes  interest and debt repurchases 
we provided for our cash requirements from available cash on hand  housing and land sales  the issuance of million of senior secured first lien notes  our prior revolving credit facility  financial service revenues  a federal tax refund and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash will be sufficient through to finance our working capital requirements and other needs  despite continued declines in total revenues  the termination of our revolving credit facility and the collateralization with cash in segregated accounts to support certain of our letters of credit 
we may also enter into land sale agreements or joint ventures to generate cash from our existing balance sheet 
in addition  we received a federal tax refund in fiscal of million 
due to a change in tax legislation that became effective on november   we can carryback our net operating loss five years to previously profitable years 
prior to the new tax legislation  we were not able to carryback our net operating loss 
we anticipate receiving a federal income tax cash refund of approximately million to million during our second quarter of fiscal our homebuilding cash balance at of october  decreased by million from october  this decrease was impacted by million for debt repurchases and tender offers  million for interest paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to debt repurchases and the october tender offer  which would have otherwise been paid in the first quarter of fiscal  and million of cash used to collateralize surety bonds and letter of credit agreements and facilities  which is now included as restricted cash 
our net loss income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net loss income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in inventory levels together with changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  deferred income taxes  accounts payable  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  amortization of computer software costs  amortization of finite lived intangibles  stock compensation awards and impairment losses for inventory  finite lived intangibles and goodwill 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal  inventory levels  prepaids  and other assets increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
certain liabilities also increase as operations expand and partially offset the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels  prepaids and other assets 
similarly  as our mortgage operations expand  net income from these operations increase  but for cash flow purposes are offset by the net change in mortgage assets and liabilities 
the opposite is true as our investment in new land purchases and development of new communities decrease  which is what has been happening since the last half of fiscal  allowing us to generate positive cash flow from operations during this period 
looking forward  given the continued deterioration in the housing market  it will become more difficult to generate positive cash flow 
however  we will continue to make adjustments to our structure and our business plans in order to maximize our liquidity 
we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow by limiting our investment in currently owned communities that we believe will not generate positive cash flow in the near term  and by seeking to identify and purchase new land parcels primarily finished lots on which homes can be built and delivered in a short period of time  generating acceptable returns  based on our underwriting standards  and positive cash flow 
on july   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october   million shares of class a common stock have been purchased under this program see part ii  item for information on equity purchases 
on july   we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  with a liquidation preference of  dividends on the series a preferred stock are not cumulative and are payable at an annual rate of 
the series a preferred stock is not convertible into the company s common stock and is redeemable in whole or in part at our option at the liquidation preference of the shares beginning on the fifth anniversary of their issuance 
the series a preferred stock is traded as depositary shares  with each depositary share representing th of a share of series a preferred stock

hovnanian  the issuer of the notes  certain of our financial services subsidiaries  joint ventures and subsidiaries holding interests in our joint ventures and our foreign subsidiary 
the indentures governing the senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes do not contain any financial maintenance covenants  but do contain restrictive covenants that limit  among other things  the company s ability and that of certain of its subsidiaries  including k 
hovnanian  the issuer of the senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes  to incur additional indebtedness other than certain permitted indebtedness  refinancing indebtedness and non recourse indebtedness  pay dividends and make distributions on common and preferred stock  repurchase senior and senior subordinated notes with respect to the senior secured first lien notes indenture  make other restricted payments  make investments  sell certain assets  incur liens  consolidate  merge  sell  or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets and enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
the indentures also contain events of default which would permit the holders of the senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes to declare those notes to be immediately due and payable if not cured within applicable grace periods  including the failure to make timely payments on the notes or other material indebtedness  the failure to comply with agreements and covenants and specified events of bankruptcy and insolvency and  with respect to the indentures governing the senior secured notes  the failure of the documents granting security for the senior secured notes to be in full force and effect and the failure of the liens on any material portion of the collateral securing the senior secured notes to be valid and perfected 
as of october   we were in compliance with the covenants of the indentures governing our outstanding notes 
under the terms of the indentures  we have the right to make certain redemptions and  depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions  may do so from time to time 
we may also continue to make debt purchases and or exchanges from time to time  through tender offers  open market purchases  private transactions  or otherwise depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions 
because of covenant restrictions in our bond indentures  we are currently unable to pay dividends  which are not cumulative  on our series a preferred stock 
if current market trends continue or worsen  we will continue to be restricted from paying dividends for the foreseeable future 
our inability to pay dividends is in accordance with covenant restrictions and will not result in a default under our bond indentures or otherwise affect compliance with any of the covenants contained in the bond indentures

on october   s p raised our corporate credit rating to ccc from ccc and revised our outlook to developing from negative 
downgrades in our credit ratings do not accelerate the scheduled maturity dates of our debt or affect the interest rates charged on any of our debt issues or our debt covenant requirements or cause any other operating issue 
the only potential risk from these negative changes in our credit ratings is that they may make it more difficult or costly for us to access capital 
however  due to our available cash resources  the downgrades in our credit ratings in the second quarter of fiscal have not impacted management s operating plans  or our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
total inventory decreased million  excluding inventory not owned  during the year ended october  total inventory  excluding inventory not owned  decreased in the northeast million  in the mid atlantic million  in the midwest million  in the southeast million  in the southwest million  and in the west million 
these decreases were due to decisions to delay or terminate new communities  as well as slow spending in current communities and due to inventory impairments recorded in these segments 
during fiscal  we incurred million in write downs primarily attributable to impairments as a result of a continued decline in sales pace  sales price and general market conditions 
in addition  we wrote off costs in the amount of million during the year ended october   related to land options that expired or we terminated 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional information 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next months 
most inventory completed or under development was is partially financed through our line of credit and debt and equity issuances 
the decreases discussed above excluded the decrease in consolidated inventory not owned of million consisting of specific performance options  options with variable interest entities  and other options that were added to our balance sheet in accordance with asc  debt product financing arrangements  and asc  leases sales leaseback transactions  and variable interest entities in accordance with asc see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional information on asc specific performance options inventory increased million for the year ended october  this increase was primarily due to the addition of specific performance lots in a community in the northeast in the second quarter of fiscal variable interest entity options inventory decreased million as we continue to take down land or walk away from deals previously consolidated under asc other options inventory decreased million for the year ended october  other options consist of inventory financed via a model home program and structured lot option agreements 
model home inventory decreased million as a result of the fact that we have terminated the use of models in certain communities where the models were no longer needed and in conjunction therewith also terminated the option to purchase those models 
structured lot option inventory decreased million 
this decrease was primarily in the southwest where we walked away from two large land purchase transactions during fiscal we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of the cost of the option and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced 
our inventory representing land and land options held for future development or sale at october   on the consolidated balance sheets  decreased by million compared to october  the decrease is due to significant impairments that were taken on land that had previously been mothballed slightly offset by sold and unsold homes and lots under development inventory being reclassified to land and land options held for future development or sale inventory when we decided to mothball or stop development on certain communities 
we mothball communities when we determine the current performance does not justify further investment at this time 
that is  we believe we will generate higher returns if we avoid spending money to improve land today and save the raw land until such times as the markets improve 
as of october   we have mothballed land in communities 
the book value associated with these communities at october  was million  net of an impairment balance of million 
we continually review communities to determine if mothballing is appropriate 
the following table summarizes home sites included in our total residential real estate 
the decrease in total home sites available in compared to is partially attributable to terminating certain option agreements  as discussed herein  and is also related to delivering homes in existing communities and not replacing those with new communities

investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million during the fiscal year ended october  the decrease is primarily due to the write down of our investment in certain joint ventures in accordance with asc  as well as distributions received from joint ventures and losses incurred by joint ventures 
this is partially offset by increases resulting from additional investments in joint ventures 
as of october   we have investments in nine homebuilding joint ventures and seven land development joint ventures 
other than guarantees limited only to completion of development  environmental indemnification and standard indemnification for fraud and misrepresentation including voluntary bankruptcy  we have no guarantees associated with unconsolidated joint ventures 
receivables  deposits and notes decreased million since october  to million at october  the decrease is primarily due to the receipt of cash of million from insurance carriers related to outstanding warranty claims  as well as the return of refundable deposits on land option transactions we terminated in fiscal property  plant and equipment decreased million during the twelve months ended october  primarily due to depreciation and a small amount of disposals  which were offset by minor additions for leasehold improvements during the period 
prepaid expenses and other assets were as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change prepaid insurance prepaid project costs senior residential rental properties other prepaids other assets total prepaid insurance decreased due to the timing of payments for insurance premium costs 
these costs are amortized over the life of the associated insurance policy  which can be one to three years 
prepaid project costs decreased for homes delivered and have not been replenished  as we have reduced the number of active selling communities given the current homebuilding environment 
prepaid project costs consist of community specific expenditures that are used over the life of the community 
such prepaids are expensed as homes are delivered 
other prepaids decreased mainly due to the debt repurchases and tender offers during fiscal  which resulted in the write off of portions of the associated prepaid debt costs 
this decrease is further impacted by the write off of prepaid credit facility costs as a result of terminating our existing facility and establishing a new one 
at october   we had million of goodwill 
this amount resulted from company acquisitions prior to fiscal as of october   we performed an annual assessment of this goodwill for impairment  and despite years of significant income generation in the markets with goodwill  primarily texas in the southwest segment and the mid atlantic segment  the financial projections of these markets resulted in a full impairment of existing goodwill 
as such  as of october  and  the goodwill balance is zero 
the impairment was written off in the line goodwill and intangible amortization and impairment on the consolidated statement of operations 
financial services mortgage loans held for sale or investment consist primarily of residential mortgages receivable held for sale of which million and million at october  and october   respectively  were being temporarily warehoused and are awaiting sale in the secondary mortgage market 
also included are residential mortgages receivable held for investment of million and million at october  and october   respectively  which represent loans that cannot currently be sold at reasonable terms in the secondary mortgage market 
we may incur risk with respect to mortgages that are delinquent  but only to the extent the losses are not covered by mortgage insurance or resale value of the house 
historically  we have incurred minimal credit losses 
we have reserves for potential losses on mortgages we currently hold 
the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale or investment from october  is directly related to a decrease in the volume of loans originated in the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal income taxes receivable decreased million from october  to a liability of million 
the net receivable of million at october  included a current receivable of million that was received during the first quarter of fiscal at october   the income tax payable balance of million related primarily to tax reserves for federal and state taxes in accordance with asc income taxes 
accounts payable and other liabilities are as follows as of in thousands october  october  dollar change accounts payable reserves accrued expenses accrued compensation other liabilities total the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the lower volume of deliveries in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
the increase in the reserves is attributable to additional accruals needed for closed communities in our west segment  due to a change in estimates related to the costs for transitioning homeowners associations from the company to the homeowners and final work to be performed in order to have municipalities provide final bond release 
the decrease in accrued expenses is primarily due to payments made for land options that were terminated and accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal but paid in the first quarter of this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million of an accrual for abandoned lease space on a rental property 
the decrease in accrued compensation was primarily due to the payout of our fiscal year bonuses during the first quarter of and reduced accruals under our bonus plans in fiscal the decrease in other liabilities is primarily related to the payment of a note that was paid during the first quarter of fiscal and a decrease in deferred profit related to sold and leased back model homes 
nonrecourse land mortgages decreased million from october   to zero at october  the decrease is primarily due to purchase money mortgages for a property in our mid atlantic segment that were paid during fiscal customer deposits decreased million from october   to million at october  the decrease is primarily due to lower contracts in backlog  lower average purchase prices of homes in backlog and certain programs that permit for lower deposits 
mortgage warehouse line of credit under our secured master repurchase agreement decreased million from million at october   to million at october  the decrease is directly correlated to the decrease in mortgage loans held for sale from october  to october  liabilities from inventory not owned and minority interest from inventory not owned decreased million and increased million  respectively  from million and million  respectively  at october   to million and million at october   respectively 
the net change in these amounts is due to the decrease in the number of variable interest entities consolidated under asc see notes to consolidated financial statements note  combined with a significant decrease in debt for one entity previously consolidated  which resulted in a corresponding increase in minority interest from inventory not owned 
accrued interest decreased million from million at october   to million at october  the decrease is partially attributed to the fact that the majority of our semi annual interest payments for our senior secured  senior and senior subordinated notes are due and paid in the first and second quarter of the year 
accrued interest is also impacted by the reduction of our debt as a result of the repurchases of our senior secured  senior and senior subordinated notes during fiscal also significantly contributing to the decrease is the repurchase of all but million of the second lien senior secured notes in october  for which five months of interest was accrued at october  and zero at october  at october   only one month of interest was accrued for the first lien senior secured notes issued in october results of operations total revenues compared to the same prior period  revenues increased decreased as follows year ended dollars in thousands october  october  october  homebuilding sale of homes land sales other revenues financial services total change total revenues percent change homebuilding compared to the same prior period  homebuilding revenues decreased  million  or  for the year ended october   decreased  million  or  for the year ended october  and decreased  million or  for the year ended october  decreased revenues in  and are primarily due to the number of home deliveries also declining   and  respectively  as well as weakening market conditions and increased competition in most of our markets 
average price per home also decreased to  for from  in and  for from  in  as a result of price declines and geographic community mix of our deliveries 
land sales are ancillary to our residential homebuilding operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down

myers  florida division in the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in housing revenues during the years ended october  and october  was primarily due to the continued weak market conditions in most of our markets 
housing revenues in decreased in all of our homebuilding segments combined by  and average sales prices decreased 
in our homebuilding segments  homes delivered decreased     and in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  southeast  southwest and west  respectively 
also contributing to the decrease in homes delivered is the decrease of active communities from at october  to at october  housing revenues in decreased in all of our homebuilding segments combined by  and average sales prices decreased 
in our homebuilding segments  homes delivered decreased     and in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  southeast  southwest and west  respectively 
another reason for reduced sales was hr  enacted into law in  which includes the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act of among other provisions  this law eliminated seller funded down payment assistance on fha insured loans approved on or after october  of our total home closings utilizing k 
hovnanian mortgage for the mortgage loans in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  approximately and  respectively  were funded with mortgage loans whereby the homebuyer used a seller financed down payment assistance program 
these programs were ended during the first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in none of our homebuyers utilizing them after the first quarter of fiscal this issue was partially mitigated by federal government purchases of fha va loans and the increase in loan limits for these types of loans 
unaudited quarterly housing revenues and net sales contracts by segment  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  for the years ending october   and are set forth below quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total quarter ended in thousands october  july  april  january  housing revenues northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total sales contracts net of cancellations northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west consolidated total our reported level of sales contracts net of cancellations has been impacted by a slowdown in the pace of sales in all of the company s segments  due to weakening market conditions and tighter mortgage loan underwriting criteria  as well as lower community count 
however  contracts per our community in are compared to fiscal of cancellation rates represent the number of cancelled contracts in the quarter divided by the number of gross sales contracts executed in the quarter 
for comparison  the following are historical cancellation rates  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth another common and meaningful way to analyze our cancellation trends is to compare the number of contract cancellations as a percentage of the beginning backlog 
the following table provides this historical comparison  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures 
quarter first second third fourth historically  most cancellations occur within the legal rescission period  which varies by state but is generally less than two weeks after the signing of the contract 
cancellations also occur as a result of a buyer s failure to qualify for a mortgage  which generally occurs during the first few weeks after signing 
however  starting in fiscal year and continuing since then  we have been experiencing higher than normal numbers of cancellations later in the construction process 
these cancellations are related primarily to falling prices  sometimes due to new discounts offered by us or other builders  leading the buyer to lose confidence in their contract price and due to tighter mortgage underwriting criteria leading to some customers inability to be approved for a mortgage loan 
in some cases  the buyer will walk away from a significant nonrefundable deposit that we recognize as other revenues 
while our cancellation rate based on gross sales contracts for fiscal year is lower than it has been for several years  and closer to more normalized levels  it is difficult to predict if this trend will continue 
however  for this same period  the cancellation rate as a percentage of beginning backlog remains higher than historical periods 
an important indicator of our future results is recently signed contracts and our home contract backlog for future deliveries 
our consolidated contract backlog  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  using base sales prices by segment is set forth below dollars in thousands october  october  october  northeast total contract backlog number of homes mid atlantic total contract backlog number of homes midwest total contract backlog number of homes southeast total contract backlog number of homes southwest total contract backlog number of homes west total contract backlog number of homes totals total consolidated contract backlog number of homes the decline in our backlog for the years ended october  and october  is a direct result of a falloff in our contract pace 
our net contracts for the full years of fiscal and  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  declined and  respectively 
in the month of november  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures  we signed an additional net contracts amounting to million in contract value 
cost of sales includes expenses for consolidated housing and land and lot sales  including inventory impairment loss and land option write offs defined as land charges in the schedules below 
a breakout of such expenses for consolidated housing sales and housing gross margin is set forth below year ended dollars in thousands october  october  october  sale of homes cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest expense homebuilding gross margin  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales interest expense  excluding land sales interest expense homebuilding gross margin  after cost of sales interest expense  before land charges land charges homebuilding gross margin  after cost of sales interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  after cost of sales interest expense  before land charges gross margin percentage after cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales expenses as a percentage of consolidated home sales revenues are presented below year ended october  october  october  sale of homes cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest housing  land and development costs commissions financing concessions overheads total cost of sales  before interest expense and land charges gross margin percentage  before cost of sales interest expense and land charges cost of sales interest gross margin percentage  after cost of sales interest expense and before land charges we sell a variety of home types in various communities  each yielding a different gross margin 
as a result  depending on the mix of communities delivering homes  consolidated gross margin may fluctuate up or down 
total homebuilding gross margins  before interest expense and land impairment and option write off charges increased to for the year ended october  compared to for the same period last year 
the declining pace of sales in our markets in   and has led to intense competition in many of our specific community locations 
in order to attempt to maintain a reasonable pace of absorption  we have increased incentives  reduced lot location premiums  as well as lowered some base prices  all of which have impacted our margins significantly and resulted in significant inventory impairments 
however  the rate of the decline has slowed in most of our segments and in a few locations we have been able to raise prices without adversely impacting sales pace 
in addition  we are delivering the final homes in some older communities where margins are lower and seeing the first deliveries in new communities where we have acquired the land at more reasonable prices 
also  we have recorded impairment reversals as homes previously impaired are delivered 
this has resulted in the modest improvement in our gross margins before cost of sales interest and land charges 
reflected as inventory impairment loss and land option write offs in cost of sales land charges  we have written off or written down certain inventories totaling million  million  and million during the years ended october    and  respectively  to their estimated fair value 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional discussion 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options and approval and engineering costs amounting to million  million  and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
when a community is redesigned  abandoned engineering costs are written off 
option and approval and engineering costs are written off when a community s pro forma profitability is not projected to produce adequate returns on the investment commensurate with the risk and we believe it is probable we will cancel the option 
such write offs were located in all of our segments 
the impairments amounting to million  million  and million for the years ending october   and  respectively  were incurred because of continued downward pressure on prices in order to maintain sales pace in many of our markets 
in  the majority of the impairments were in the northeast and west segments 
impairments in the northeast were due to increased weakness in the market  primarily in the suburbs of manhattan 
in the west  where we have to compete with significant competition from foreclosures  we have had to continue to reduce prices in order to maintain sales pace 
this is especially true in some of the more fringe markets in our west segment 
below is a break down of our lot option walk aways and impairments by segment for fiscal in  in total  we walked away from of all the lots we controlled under option contracts 
the remaining of our option lots are in communities that remain economically feasible  including a substantial number that were successfully renegotiated over the past year 
the following table represents lot option walk aways by segment for the year ended october  in millions dollar amount of walk away number of walk away lots of walk away lots total option lots at october  walk away lots as a of total lots northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total includes lots optioned that the company walked away from in the year ended october  the following table represents impairments by segment for the year ended october  in millions dollar amount of impairment of impairments pre impairment value of pre impairment value northeast mid atlantic midwest southeast southwest west total homebuilding selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended october   and decreased to million for the year ended october  from million for the year ended october  this decrease in expenses is the result of reduced costs through headcount reduction  other cost saving measures and a decreased number of communities 
despite the decreases in expenses  the amount of homebuilding selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue has increased  due to reduced home deliveries 
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended in thousands october  october  october  land and lot sales cost of sales  net of impairment reversals and excluding interest land and lot sales gross margin  excluding interest land sales interest expense land and lot sales gross margin  including interest land sales are ancillary to our residential homebuilding operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down 
profits from land sales for the year ended october  were less than for the year ended october  although we budget land sales  they are often dependent upon receiving approvals and entitlements  the timing of which can be uncertain 
as a result  projecting the amount and timing of land sales is difficult 
other revenues decreased million and million for the years ended october  and october   respectively 
other revenues include income from contract cancellations  where the deposit has been forfeited due to contract terminations  interest income  cash discounts and miscellaneous one time receipts

west homebuilding revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in homes delivered and a decrease in average selling price

loss before income taxes decreased million to a loss of million in partially due to a million decrease in inventory impairment losses and land option write offs 
in addition  gross margin before interest expense increased in  as we are starting to see signs of price stabilization in this market and the benefit of impairment reserve reversals as homes are delivered 
homebuilding revenues decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in homes delivered and a decrease in average selling price 
this reduced revenue was further compounded by a significant reduction in gross margin percentage before interest expense 
the decrease in deliveries and the reduced gross margin was the result of the more competitive and slowing housing market in california throughout and more so in as a result of the above and a million increase in inventory impairment losses and land option write offs in  loss before income taxes increased million to a loss of million in financial services financial services consist primarily of originating mortgages from our homebuyers  selling such mortgages in the secondary market  and title insurance activities 
we use mandatory investor commitments and forward sales of mortgage backed securities mbs to hedge our mortgage related interest rate exposure on agency and government loans 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk associated with mbs forward commitments and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks  federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the mbs forward commitments 
in an effort to reduce our exposure to the marketability and disposal of non agency and non governmental loans  including alt a fico scores below and depending on credit criteria and sub prime loans fico scores below and depending on credit criteria  we require our financial services segment to either presell or broker all of these loans  on an individual loan basis as soon as they are committed to by the customer 
however  because of the recent tightening by mortgage lenders  none of the loans we originated during fiscal were alt a or sub prime as compared to of our originated loans being alt a loans and of our originated loans being sub prime loans for the same period last year 
as alt a and sub prime originations declined  we have seen an increase in our level of federal housing administration and veterans administration fha va loan origination 
for the year ended october  and  fha va loans represented and  respectively  of our total loans 
profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control passes to the buyer of the mortgage and the sales price is collected 
during the years ended october    and  financial services provided a million  million  and million pretax profit  respectively 
in financial services revenue decreased million to million due to a decrease in the number of mortgage settlements and a decrease in the average loan amount 
also  in  we recorded expense of million for abandoned lease space  which contributed to the decrease in pretax profit of million from october  to october  revenues from october  to october  decreased million to million consistent with our reduction in mortgage settlements 
in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively 
servicing rights on new mortgages originated by us will be sold with the loans 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses include the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
these expenses include payroll  stock compensation  facility and other costs associated with our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
corporate general and administrative expenses declined million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october   and million for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  the reduction in expenses is due to reduced salaries resulting from headcount reduction  reduced bonuses and other overhead cost savings 
the slight reduction from to was after an expense of million for the cancellation of stock options 
during fiscal  the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  each of the non executive members of the board of directors and other senior executives of the company consented to the cancellation of certain of their options with the full understanding that the company made no commitment to provide them with any other form of consideration in respect of the cancelled options in order to reduce a portion of the equity reserve overhang under the company s equity compensation plans represented by the number of shares of the company s common stock remaining available for future issuance under such plans including shares that may be issued upon the exercise or vesting of outstanding options and other rights 
the million charge to operations is offset by a credit to paid in capital 
excluding this option cancellation expense  corporate  general and administrative expenses decreased million for the year ended october  compared to october  other interest other interest increased million to million for the year ended october  for fiscal  other interest increased million to million 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  our assets that qualify for interest capitalization inventory under development no longer exceeded our debt  and therefore a portion of interest not covered by qualifying assets must be directly expensed 
as our inventory balances have continued to decrease  the amount of interest required to be directly expensed has increased 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior rental residential property operations  rent expense for commercial office space  amortization of prepaid bond fees  minority interest relating to consolidated joint ventures  and corporate owned life insurance 
other operations increased million to million for the year ended october   and increased million to million for the year ended october  the increase in other operations from october  to october  is primarily due to a million accrual for abandoned commercial lease space 
this expense was offset by income of million due to the reversal of an accrual related to litigation in the fourth quarter of fiscal  when it was determined that payment was no longer probable 
the increase in other operations from october  to october   is attributed to the million in legal and settlement costs in  related to the dismissal of certain litigation  as well as an increase in rent expense from a new commercial rental property 
goodwill and intangible amortization and impairments we amortized our finite lived intangibles over their expected useful life  ranging from one to four years 
at the end of fiscal year  we wrote off all of our remaining intangible assets 
as a result  there was no expense in fiscal in fiscal  this expense includes the impairment of the remaining million balance of finite lived intangibles and million of goodwill 
goodwill and intangible amortization and impairments decreased million for the year ended october   when compared to the decrease for the year ended october  was primarily the result of reduced intangible amortization in as a result of the extensive write offs during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by the impairments recorded in gain on extinguishment of debt during the year ended october   we repurchased in the open market a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior and senior subordinated notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we recognized a gain of million net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees  related to these purchases which represents the difference between the principal amounts of the notes and the purchase price 
in addition  on december   we exchanged a total of million principal amount of various issues of our unsecured senior notes due through for million in senior secured notes due this exchange resulted in a recognized gain of million 
during the year ended october   we completed cash tender offers whereby we purchased an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of various issues of our secured and unsecured senior and senior subordinated notes due through for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  plus accrued unpaid interest 
as a result of the tender offers we recognized a gain of million in the third quarter of fiscal  net of the write off of unamortized discounts and fees and a loss of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the fourth quarter loss was offset by gains from open market repurchases resulting in a net loss of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal we may continue to make additional debt purchases and or exchanges through tender offers  open market purchases  private transactions or otherwise from time to time depending on market conditions and covenant restrictions 
loss income from unconsolidated joint ventures loss income from unconsolidated joint ventures consists of our share of the losses or earnings of the joint venture 
the loss increased million to a loss of million for the year ended october  the increased loss in is mainly due to the write down of our investment in one of our joint ventures where the full investment was determined to be impaired  as well as our share of the losses from inventory impairments from two other joint ventures 
these losses were offset by the fact that we are no longer recording any loss related to a fourth joint venture because we wrote off our investment in that joint venture in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and have no further funding commitments to this entity 
our loss in increased million to a loss of million for the year ended october  the increase in the loss in is mainly due to our share of the losses from operations on our unconsolidated joint ventures  as well as the write off of our investment we had in two homebuilding joint ventures 
total taxes total tax provision benefit as a percentage of the loss before taxes was for the months ended october  the rate was negative because we recorded an additional million charge to our current and deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the twelve months ended october   completely offsetting the tax benefit from loss before taxes and we recorded additional federal and state tax reserves during the year in accordance with asc  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and further below 
deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if  for some reason  the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years or carried forward to future years to recover the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with asc  we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required 
asc requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
given the continued downturn in the homebuilding industry during  and  resulting in additional inventory and intangible impairments  we are now in a three year cumulative loss position 
according to asc  a three year cumulative loss is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable  and in this circumstance  the company does not rely on projections of future taxable income to support the recovery of deferred tax assets 
therefore  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance for current and deferred taxes increased million and million during the months ended october  and  to million at october  our current and deferred tax assets at october  and october   for which there was no valuation allowance  related to amounts that were realized through reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or through carrybacks to the and years 
on november   president obama signed the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  under which  the company is able to carryback its net operating loss five years to previously profitable years that were not available to the company for carryback prior to the new tax legislation 
we will record the impact of the carryback  estimated to be between million and million  in the first quarter of fiscal and expect to receive a federal income tax cash refund in the second quarter of fiscal off balance sheet financing in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at october   we had million in option deposits in cash and letters of credit to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of million 
our liability is generally limited to forfeiture of the nonrefundable deposits  letters of credit and other nonrefundable amounts incurred 
we have no material third party guarantees 
however  million of the million in land and lot option purchase contracts contain specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots upon satisfaction of certain requirements by both the sellers and the company 
therefore  this specific performance obligation of million  which is the purchase price for these lots net of cash deposits already paid  is recorded on the balance sheet in liabilities from inventory not owned 
pursuant to asc  consolidation asc  we consolidated million of inventory not owned at october   representing the fair value of the optioned property 
additionally  to reflect the fair value of the inventory consolidated under asc  we eliminated million of its related cash deposits for lot option contracts  which are included in consolidated inventory not owned 
since we do not own an equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities vie that we must consolidate pursuant to asc  we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners 
when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers  certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required 
in most cases  the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been based on the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing 
in these cases  it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity 
at october   the balance reported in minority interest from inventory not owned was million 
at october   we had cash deposits and letters of credit totaling million  representing our current maximum exposure associated with the consolidation of lot option contracts 
creditors of these vies  if any  have no recourse against us 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure related to our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our aggregate contractual commitments at october  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total represents our senior secured  senior  and senior subordinated notes  other notes payable and related interest payments for the life of the debt of million 
interest on variable rate obligations is based on rates effective as of october  represents obligations under option contracts with specific performance provisions  net of cash deposits 
total contractual obligations exclude our accrual for uncertain tax positions recorded for financial reporting purposes as of october  because we were unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
we had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds of approximately million and million  respectively  at october   related principally to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments 
we do not believe that any such letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
inflation inflation has a long term effect  because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house construction costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
inflation has a lesser short term effect  because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with many  but not all  of our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between three to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales

in connection with our mortgage operations  mortgage loans held for sale  and the associated mortgage warehouse line of credit under our secured master repurchase agreement are subject to interest rate risk  however  such obligations reprice frequently and are short term in duration 
in addition  we hedge the interest rate risk on mortgage loans by obtaining forward commitments from private investors 
accordingly the risk from mortgage loans is not material 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk except with respect to mortgage loans 
we are also subject to foreign currency risk but we do not believe this risk is material

on october   we terminated our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of our prior revolving credit facility  interest was based on one  two  three or six month libor  plus  a base rate equal to the greater of pnc bank  national association s prime rate  and the federal funds effective rate plus  plus or an index rate based on daily libor  plus 
we believe that a increase in this rate would have resulted in an approximate million increase in interest expense for the months ended october   assuming an average of million of variable rate debt outstanding from november  to october
