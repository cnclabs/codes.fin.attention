overview the company our research and development r d programs are focused on identifying and developing potential cell based therapeutics which can either restore or support organ function 
since we relocated our corporate headquarters and research laboratories to california in our r d efforts have primarily been directed at refining our methods for identifying  isolating  culturing  and purifying the human neural stem cell and human liver engrafting cells hlec and developing these as potential cell based therapeutics for the central nervous system cns and the liver  respectively 
in our cns program  our hucns sc product candidate purified human neural stem cells is in clinical development for two indications 
in january  we completed a six patient phase i clinical trial to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of hucns sc cells as a treatment for infantile and late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl  two forms of a group of disorders often referred to as batten disease 
we expect to complete data analysis and to report the trial results in mid in december  the fda approved our ind to initiate a phase i clinical trial of hucns sc cells in a second indication  pelizeaus merzbacher disease pmd  a fatal myelination disorder in the brain 
we expect the pmd trial to begin enrolling patients in and that the trial will take months to complete 
in addition  our hucns sc cells are in preclinical development for spinal cord injury and retinal disorders 
in our liver program  we are in preclinical development with our human liver engrafting cells hlec and we plan to seek the necessary approvals to initiate a clinical study to evaluate hlec as a potential cellular therapy  with the initial indication likely to be liver based metabolic disorders 
see overview research and development programs in the business section of part i  item of this form k for a brief description of our significant research and development programs 
we have also conducted research on several other cell types and in other areas  which could lead to other possible product candidates  process improvements or further research activities 
we have not derived any revenue or cash flows from the sale or commercialization of any products except for license revenue for certain of our patented cells and media for use in research 
as a result  we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
therefore  we are 
table of contents dependent upon external financing from equity and debt offerings and revenue from collaborative research arrangements with corporate sponsors to finance our operations 
we have no such collaborative research arrangements at this time and there can be no assurance that such financing or partnering revenue will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
before we can derive revenue or cash inflows from the commercialization of any of our therapeutic product candidates  we will need to i conduct substantial in vitro testing and characterization of our proprietary cell types  ii undertake preclinical and clinical testing for specific disease indications  iii develop  validate and scale up manufacturing processes to produce these cell based therapeutics  and iv pursue required regulatory approvals 
these steps are risky  expensive and time consuming 
overall  we expect our r d expenses to be substantial and to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and clinical investigation of our current and future product candidates 
however  expenditures on r d programs are subject to many uncertainties  including whether we develop our product candidates with a partner or independently 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our current product candidates will be subject to future collaboration  when such collaboration agreements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
in addition  there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our cell based therapeutics  including future trial design and regulatory requirements  many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time given the stage of our development and the novel nature of stem cell technologies 
the regulatory pathways  both in the united states and internationally  are complex and fluid given the novel and  in general  clinically unproven nature of stem cell technologies 
at this time  due to such uncertainties and inherent risks  we cannot estimate in a meaningful way the duration of  or the costs to complete  our r d programs or whether  when or to what extent we will generate revenues or cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical prospects of each product candidate  as well as our ongoing assessment of the regulatory requirements and each product candidate s commercial potential 
if we are successful in completing the acquisition of the business of scs  we would expect our expenses and expenditures to increase 
given the early stage of development of our product candidates  any estimates of when we may be able to commercialize one or more of these products would not be meaningful 
moreover  any estimate of the time and investment required to develop potential products based upon our proprietary hucns sc and hlec technologies will change depending on the ultimate approach or approaches we take to pursue them  the results of preclinical and clinical studies  and the content and timing of decisions made by the fda and other regulatory authorities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop any product successfully  or that we will be able to recover our development costs  whether upon commercialization of a developed product or otherwise 
we cannot provide assurance that any of these programs will result in products that can be marketed or marketed profitably 
if certain of our development stage programs do not result in commercially viable products  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
significant events in january  we completed enrollment and dosing of a six patient phase i clinical trial of our hucns sc product candidate as a treatment for infantile and late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis ncl at oregon health science university ohsu doernbecher children s hospital 
in january  we entered into a research collaboration with the ohsu casey eye institute to evaluate our hucns sc product candidate as a potential treatment for retinal degeneration  a leading cause of blindness 
in april  the us patent and trademark office issued us patent number  with broad claims covering human neural stem cells derived from any tissue source  including embryonic  fetal  juvenile  or adult tissue 
the patent is exclusively licensed to us 

table of contents in june  us patent and trademark office issued us patent number  claiming the use of additional monoclonal antibodies for the prospective isolation of rare cells from human neural tissue  such as our hucns sc product candidate 
the patent is assigned to us 
in september  stewart craig  phd joined us as senior vice president  development and operations  with responsibility for process design and engineering  gmp manufacturing operations  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  facilities and supply chain management 
dr 
craig has over twenty five years of experience in the biotechnology sector  the last of which have been in the cell therapy field 
in october  we were awarded a  grant from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases to research and develop a potential cell based therapeutic for liver disease arising from infection by the hepatitis c virus 
this grant will fund work over the next year to investigate whether our human liver engrafting cells can be made resistant to infection by the hepatitis c virus 
in november  we reported that our hucns sc cells  when transplanted into a well established animal model  can protect the retina from progressive degeneration and prevent the loss of visual function 
retinal degeneration leads to loss of vision in diseases such as age related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa 
in november  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds through the sale of approximately million units at per unit 
each unit consisted of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we received total proceeds  net of offering expenses and placement agency fees  of approximately million 
in december  the fda approved our ind to initiate a clinical trial of our hucns sc product candidate to treat pelizaeus merzbacher disease pmd  a fatal brain disorder that mainly affects young children 
this phase i trial  which is designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of hucns sc cells as a treatment for pmd  is expected to begin enrolling patients in in january  we completed the six patient phase i clinical trial of our hucns sc product candidate as a treatment for infantile and late infantile ncl 
in march  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with stem cell sciences plc scs to acquire substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of scs the proposed acquisition 
the acquisition is subject to the approval of the stockholders of scs and other customary closing conditions  and is expected to close shortly after the scs extraordinary general meeting scheduled for march  critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we have established internal controls related to the preparation of these estimates 
actual results and the timing of the results could differ materially from these estimates 
warrant liability we account for our warrants in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock eitf  which defines how freestanding contracts that are indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock should be measured and classified 
the general concept under eitf is that contracts that could require net cash settlement should be classified as assets or liabilities and contracts that only provide for settlement in shares should be classified as equity 
in order for a contract to be classified as equity  each of the specific conditions enumerated in eitf must be met  these conditions are intended to identify situations in which net cash 
table of contents settlement could be forced upon the issuer 
as part of our november financing  we issued warrants with a five year term to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
in accordance with eitf  we are required to classify the fair value of the warrants issued as a liability  with subsequent changes in fair value to be recorded as income loss on change in fair value of warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
we will continue to classify the fair value of the warrants as a liability until the warrants are exercised  expire or are amended in a way that would no longer require these warrants to be classified as a liability 
the estimated fair value of our warrant liability at december   was approximately  stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which revises sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards  including employee stock options and restricted stock units 
under the provisions of sfas r  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
in we estimated this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting terminations 
our estimate of the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury debt securities with maturities close to the expected term of the option as of the date of grant 
as required under sfas r  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
for the year ended december   employee stock based compensation expense was approximately  as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock options and restricted stock units not yet recognized was approximately  which is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of years 
wind down expenses in connection with our wind down of our research and manufacturing operations in lincoln  rhode island  and the relocation of our corporate headquarters and remaining research laboratories to california in october  we provided a reserve for our estimate of the exit cost obligation in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the reserve reflects estimates of the ongoing costs of our former research and administrative facility in lincoln  which we hold on a lease that terminates on june  we are seeking to sublease  assign  sell  or otherwise divest ourselves of our interest in the facility at the earliest possible time  but we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur  if at all 
in determining the facility exit cost reserve amount  we are required to consider our lease payments through the end of the lease term and estimate other relevant factors such as facility operating expenses  real estate market conditions in rhode island for similar facilities  occupancy rates  and sublease rental rates projected over the course of the leasehold 
we re evaluate the estimate each quarter  taking into account changes  if any  in each of the underlying factors 
the process is inherently subjective because it involves projections into time from the date of the estimate through the end of the lease and it is not possible to determine any of the factors except the lease payments with certainty over that period 
management forms its best estimate on a quarterly basis  after considering actual sublease activity  reports from our broker realtor about current and predicted real estate market conditions in rhode island  the likelihood of new subleases in the foreseeable future for the specific facility and significant changes in the actual or projected operating expenses of the property 
we discount the projected net outflow over the term of the lease to arrive at the 
table of contents present value  and adjust the reserve to that figure 
the estimated vacancy rate for the facility is an important assumption in determining the reserve because changes in this assumption have the greatest effect on estimated sublease income 
in addition  the vacancy rate estimate is the variable most subject to change  while at the same time it involves the greatest judgment and uncertainty due to the absence of highly predictive information concerning the future of the local economy and future demand for specialized laboratory and office space in that area 
the average vacancy rate of the facility over the last six years through was approximately  varying from to 
as of december   based on current information available to management  the vacancy rate is projected to be approximately for  and approximately from through the end of the lease 
these estimates are based on actual occupancy as of december   predicted lead time for acquiring new subtenants  historical vacancy rates for the area and assessments by our broker realtor of future real estate market conditions 
if the assumed vacancy rate for to the end of the lease had been five percentage points higher or lower at december   then the reserve would have increased or decreased by approximately  similarly  a increase or decrease in the operating expenses for the facility from on would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  and a increase or decrease in the assumed average rental charge per square foot would have increased or decreased the reserve by approximately  management does not wait for specific events to change its estimate  but instead uses its best efforts to anticipate them on a quarterly basis 
for the year ended december   we recorded actual expenses against this reserve net of subtenant income of approximately  based on management s evaluation of the factors mentioned above  and particularly the projected vacancy rates described above  we adjusted the reserve to  at december  by recording an additional  as wind down expenses for the year ended december  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb staff position no 
fin 
under sfas and fin  we must recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities  and deferred tax assets and liabilities  are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not would be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax positions requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  and the applicable statute of limitations 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 

table of contents contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements of part ii  item of this form k for further information on these matters 
results of operations our results of operations have varied significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and may vary significantly in the future due to the occurrence of material recurring and nonrecurring events  including without limitation the receipt and payment of recurring and nonrecurring licensing payments  the initiation or termination of research collaborations  the on going expenses to lease and maintain our rhode island facilities  other than temporary impairment of our financial assets  changes in estimated fair value of our warrant liability  and the increasing costs associated with operating our california facility and expanding our operations 
revenue revenue totaled approximately  in   in  and  in change in change in versus versus revenue licensing agreements and grants the increase in licensing and grant revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to the receipt of a  milestone payment under a license agreement 
in addition  in october  we were awarded a  grant from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases to research and develop a potential cell based therapeutic for liver disease arising from infection by the hepatitis c virus 
the award is a phase i grant under the small business innovation research sbir program of the national institutes of health 
we recognized approximately  as grant revenue in the decrease in licensing and grant revenue in as compared to was primarily attributable to the completed draw down in of a  small business technology transfer grant for studies in alzheimer s disease that was awarded in september the grant supported joint work with dr 
george a 
carlson of the mclaughlin research institute mri in great falls  montana 
we received and recognized approximately  in  as grant revenue for this study 
operating expenses operating expense totaled approximately  in   in  and  in change in change in versus versus operating expenses research development general administrative wind down expenses total operating expenses research and development expenses our r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  costs associated with clinical trials and regulatory submissions  costs associated with preclinical activities such as toxicology studies  costs associated with cell processing and process development  certain patent related costs such as licensing  facilities 
table of contents related costs such as depreciation  lab equipment and supplies 
clinical trial expenses include payments to vendors such as clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
cumulative r d costs incurred since we refocused our activities on developing cell based therapeutics fiscal years through were approximately million 
over this period  the majority of these cumulative costs were related to i characterization of our proprietary hucns sc cell  ii expenditures for toxicology and other preclinical studies  preparation and submission of applications to regulatory agencies to conduct clinical trials and obtaining regulatory clearance to initiate such trials  all with respect to our hucns sc cells  iii preclinical studies and development of our human liver engrafting cells  and iv costs associated with cell processing and process development 
we use and manage our r d resources  including our employees and facilities  across various projects rather than on a project by project basis for the following reasons 
the allocations of time and resources change as the needs and priorities of individual projects and programs change  and many of our researchers are assigned to more than one project at any given time 
furthermore  we are exploring multiple possible uses for each of our proprietary cell types  so much of our r d effort is complementary to and supportive of each of these projects 
lastly  much of our r d effort is focused on manufacturing processes  which can result in process improvements useful across cell types 
we also use external service providers to assist in the conduct of our clinical trials  to manufacture certain of our product candidates and to provide various other r d related products and services 
many of these costs and expenses are complementary to and supportive of each of our programs 
because we do not have a development collaborator for any of our product programs  we are currently responsible for all costs incurred with respect to our product candidates 
r d expense totaled approximately  in  as compared to  in and  in at december   we had full time employees working in research and development and laboratory support services as compared to at december  and at december  versus the decrease in r d expenses of approximately  or  in as compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in external services of approximately  these external services were mainly related to manufacturing and testing of our cells and to clinical trial expenses 
the decrease in clinical trial expenses was due mainly to the completion of enrollment and dosing of our six patient phase i clinical trial in january the decrease in r d expenses was also attributable to a decrease in business travel expenses of approximately  these decreased r d expenses were partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses primarily attributable to i an increase in share based compensation expense of  and ii an increase in other operating expenses of approximately  primarily attributable to supplies 
versus the increase in r d expenses of approximately  or  in as compared to was primarily attributable to the expansion of our operations in cell processing and clinical development 
a portion of our cell processing and clinical operations are performed by external service providers  so external services and clinical trial costs were approximately  of the increase in r d expenses 
the increase in r d expenses was also due to an increase in personnel costs of approximately  of which approximately  was attributable to stock based compensation expense

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other g a expenses 
wind down expenses in  in connection with exiting our former research facility in rhode island  we created a reserve for the estimated lease payments and operating expenses related to it 
the reserve has been re evaluated and adjusted based on assumptions relevant to real estate market conditions and the estimated time until we could either fully sublease  assign or sell our remaining interests in the property 
the reserve was approximately  at december  and  at december  payments net of subtenant income were recorded against this reserve of  in   in  and  in we re evaluated the estimate and adjusted the reserve by recording in aggregate  additional wind down expenses of  in   in  and  in expenses for this facility will fluctuate based on changes in tenant occupancy rates and other operating expenses related to the lease 
even though it is our intent to sublease  assign  sell  or otherwise divest ourselves of our interests in the facility at the earliest possible time  we cannot determine with certainty a fixed date by which such events will occur 
in light of this uncertainty  based on estimates  we will periodically re evaluate and adjust the reserve  as necessary

license and settlement agreement in july  we entered into an agreement with reneuron limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of reneuron group plc  a listed uk corporation collectively referred to as reneuron 
as part of the agreement  we granted reneuron a license that allows reneuron to exploit their c mycer conditionally immortalized adult human neural stem cell technology for therapy and other purposes 
we received shares of reneuron common stock  as well as a cross license to the exclusive use of reneuron s technology for certain diseases and conditions  including lysosomal storage diseases  spinal cord injury  cerebral palsy  and multiple sclerosis 
the agreement also provides

we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows since inception 
we have not achieved profitability and may not be able to realize sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we do not expect to be profitable in the next several years  but rather expect to incur additional operating losses 
we have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain significant additional capital resources in order to sustain our product development efforts  for acquisition of technologies and intellectual property rights  for preclinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  for general and administrative expenses and other working capital requirements 
we rely on cash balances and proceeds from equity and debt offerings  
table of contents proceeds from the transfer or sale of our intellectual property rights  equipment  facilities or investments  and government grants and funding from collaborative arrangements  if obtainable  to fund our operations 
we intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through equity and debt financings  grants and collaborative research arrangements 
on june  we filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement  declared effective july   which permits us to issue up to million worth of registered debt and equity securities 
under this effective shelf registration  we have the flexibility to issue registered securities  from time to time  in one or more separate offerings or other transactions with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
registered securities issued using this shelf may be used to raise additional capital to fund our working capital and other corporate needs  for future acquisitions of assets  programs or businesses  and for other corporate purposes 
as of march   we had approximately million under our universal shelf registration statement available for issuing debt or equity securities  approximately million of this million has been reserved for the potential exercise of the warrants issued in connection with our november financing 
in july  we deregistered the remaining unissued shares approximately million worth of common stock available under the shelf registration statement we had filed in october the shelf permitted the issuance of up to million of registered shares of common stock 
also in july  we amended our sales agreement with cantor to allow for sales under our universal shelf registration rather than the shelf registration 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on our progress in our exploratory  preclinical and future clinical development programs 
funding may not be available when needed at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
lack of necessary funds may require us  among other things  to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  planned clinical trials  and or our capital expenditures or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties 
in addition  the decline in economic activity  together with the deterioration of the credit and capital markets  could have an adverse impact on potential sources of future financing

operating leases we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  and minimum lease payments 
some of our leases have options to renew 
we entered into and amended a lease agreement for an approximately  square foot facility located at the stanford research park in palo alto  california

indemnification agreement in july  we amended our and license agreements with neurospheres 
neurospheres is the holder of certain patents exclusively licensed by us  including the six patents that are the basis of our patent infringement suits against neuralstem 
as part of the amendment  we agreed to pay all reasonable litigation costs  expenses and attorney s fees incurred by neurospheres in the declaratory judgment suit between us and neuralstem 
in return  we are entitled to off set all litigation costs incurred in that suit against amounts that would otherwise be owed under the license agreements  such as annual maintenance fees  milestones and royalty payments 
at this time  we cannot estimate the likely total costs of our pending litigation with neuralstem  given the unpredictable nature of such proceedings  or the total amount we may ultimately owe under the neurospheres license agreements 
however  the ability to apply the offsets will run for the entire term of each license agreement 
for these reasons  we have chosen to approximate the potential value of the offset receivable by assuming that all litigation charges actually incurred in the declaratory judgment action as of december   will ultimately be offset against royalties owed 
management will reevaluate this assumption on a quarterly basis based on actual costs and other relevant factors 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our legally binding and enforceable contractual cash obligations payable in total obligations payable in payable in payable in payable in payable in and at beyond operating lease payments capital lease equipment bonds payable principal interest total contractual cash obligations operating lease payments exclude space sharing and sub lease income
