we and our partners are focused on the following applications where our products and services make it possible for our customers to achieve measurable and meaningful reductions in their operating costs  greater efficiency in their operations and improvements in their customer service and support activities field mobility applications asset visibility and management 
many firms have employees in the field who are using  operating  installing or retrieving valuable assets such as machinery  tools  equipment  components and parts 
tracking those assets and their condition while they are in the field allows our customers to reduce capital expenditures  operating expenses  working capital requirements and cash consumption 
direct store delivery dsd 
dsd is the delivery of consumer goods from a supplier or distributor directly to a retail store  bypassing a warehouse 
dsd activities typically include in store inventory management  store level authorized item management  store level ordering  forecasting  product pricing  promotion  invoicing  the physical delivery and return of merchandise  the electronic exchange of delivery data  and shelf merchandising 
our products and services allow our customers to manage these activities while they are in progress in the field and  in this manner  increase orders and revenue  achieve just in time inventory replenishment  update and confirm pricing on the fly  track promotion costs and product returns  etc 
maintenance  repair and overhaul 
many firms provide in field maintenance  repair and refurbishment services for their own products or for products manufactured by others 
these services typically involve the steps of finding the specific location of the equipment within a facility or a yard  evaluating or confirming the nature of the work required  resolving technical or other issues which arise while the work is being performed  testing to confirm that the work had the desired effect  reporting the completion of the work  updating equipment service and repair records  invoicing for parts and labor  etc 
our products and services allow our customers to manage these activities while their employees are in the field and  in this manner  enhance revenue and decrease the cost  time and trouble of in field maintenance and repair 
in transit visibility 
most shippers and transporters want to know where their shipments are  who received the shipment  when it was delivered  the conditions and events that may have impacted the shipment in transit eg  temperature  humidity  shocks  the condition of the shipment on delivery  etc 
our products and services allow our customers to acquire  transmit  analyze and manage this information while the shipments are in the field and  in this manner  reduce the cost and simplify the management of outbound and inbound shipments 
routing and navigation 
many firms that operate transportation fleets want in field control over their transportation assets so they can maximize the revenues generated by those assets and minimize their costs 
our products and services make this possible by allowing these firms to use automated route and revenue optimization systems  dynamic routing systems and navigation support systems while their transportation assets are in the field 
telematics 
many firms operating transportation fleets also want to gather data about their transportation assets and operators while they are in the field and use that data to improve performance in the field and system wide 
our products and services make this possible by allowing these firms to use automated methods of collecting  transmitting  analyzing and acting on data from the field such as vehicle tracking  engine diagnostics and parameters  fuel parameters and operator hours 
in premise applications asset visibility and management 
most employees are using  operating  installing or retrieving valuable assets such as machinery  tools  equipment  components and parts in facilities owned or leased by their employers 
our products and services allow our customers to remotely track these assets and their condition and  in this manner  reduce shrink  and reduce capital expenditures  operating expenses  working capital requirements and cash consumption 
item business continued freight yard operations 
firms operating transportation fleets want to use information about their freight yards to increase revenues  improve productivity and reduce costs 
our products and services allow these firms to automatically collect  transmit  analyze and dynamically act on data from the yard such as inbound and outbound vehicles  yard location of equipment  equipment and operator availability  vehicle trailer mismatches and goods loaded or offloaded from vehicles or trailers 
inventory management 
most firms want an efficient method of regularly gathering inventory data from their supply chain so that they can use it to establish optimal inventory policies and to rapidly respond to unplanned changes in demand and supply 
our products and services meet this need by allowing firms to automatically collect  transmit  analyze and act on inventory data whether the inventory is in a plant  warehouse or a retail store 
warehouse operations

markets and customers because aidc solutions can be used by a company of any size  the aidc market is large 
market growth is driven by the need for technologies and solutions that reduce capital expenditures  operating expenses  working capital requirements and cash consumption and improve productivity  quality  customer service and support 
we cover the market through a combination of a direct sales and service organization  two tier distributors  resellers and independent hardware  software and service vendors 
our direct sales organization serves customers from offices throughout the americas  europe  the middle east and africa and in selected asia pacific countries  including china and australia 
our two tiered sales channel is also global and includes value added distributors and resellers 
item business continued our customer base consists of private and public entities of many sizes 
in  and  one customer  scansource  inc  and its affiliated companies accounted for more than of our revenues 
total sales to this customer were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
scansource is a distributor of our products  and not an end user customer 
the aidc market is highly competitive and there are many firms capable of becoming and  we believe  willing to become distributors for intermec in addition to those now engaged in that role 
we do not believe that intermec is substantially dependent upon any contractual arrangements with scansource or its affiliated companies 
competition the market for aidc products is fragmented  highly competitive and rapidly changing 
independent market surveys suggest that we are one of the larger participants measured by revenues 
motorola  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  symbol technologies  inc  are major competitors  supplying a range of barcode  rfid and mobile computing products and services 
we also face strong competition in individual aidc product lines from suppliers such as zebra technologies corporation  which supplies barcode and rfid printers  and honeywell corporation  which supplies barcode imagers 
in the label media area  we face competition from a number of large and small media producers  including  among many others  avery denison and brady 
we compete primarily on the basis of our technology and expertise in our target markets  but our support services  product functionality  performance  ruggedness and overall product quality are also important elements of our competitive offerings 
research and development research and development expenditures amounted to million  million  and million  all of which we sponsored in the years ended december   and  respectively 
intellectual property we strive to protect our investment in technology and to secure competitive advantage by obtaining ip protection 
we have obtained approximately patents and a number of trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
when appropriate  we have obtained licenses to use ip controlled by other organizations 
as we expand our product offerings  we try to obtain patents related to such offerings and  when appropriate  seek licenses to use inventions patented by third parties 
to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors  we have obtained certain trademarks and trade names  and as we expand our product and service offerings  we try to obtain trademarks and trade names to cover those new offerings 
we protect certain details of our processes  products and strategies as trade secrets by restricting access to that information 
we have ongoing programs designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information 
we license our ip to generate revenue or to facilitate our effort to market and sell our products and services 
we try to protect our investment in technology  generate revenue and secure competitive advantage by enforcing our ip rights 
the nature  timing and geographic location of these efforts depends  in part  on the types of legal protection given to different types of ip rights in various countries 
seasonality and backlog our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products and services  since our revenues are typically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest in the first fiscal quarter 
see quarterly financial information on page of this form k for quarterly revenues and expenses 
sales backlog from our continuing operations was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
our business typically operates without a significant backlog of firm orders  and we do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of future sales 
item business continued employees at december   we had  full time employees  of which  were engaged in our wholly owned subsidiary  intermec technologies corporation  and were engaged in our holding company  intermec  inc approximately of our full time employees are in the united states  approximately are in europe  the middle east and africa emea  and the remainder are employed throughout the rest of the world  including the asia pacific region  latin america  canada and mexico 
discontinued operations in  we divested our industrial automation systems ias businesses  which comprised the cincinnati lamb and landis grinding systems divisions 
the ias businesses are classified as discontinued operations for accounting purposes in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
at the time of divestiture  the ias businesses were producers of manufacturing products and services  including integrated manufacturing systems  machining systems  stand alone machine tools and precision grinding and abrasives operations primarily serving the global aerospace  automotive  off road vehicle and diesel engine industries as well as the industrial components  heavy equipment and general job shop markets

mr 
wills previously served as our vice president general manager  global services and rfid from september to december prior thereto  mr 
wills was vice president general manager  printers and media  from april to september item business continued environmental and regulatory matters in january  the european parliament and council adopted directive ec on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive 
the rohs directive went into effect on july   and prohibits firms from putting on the european union eu market new electrical and electronic equipment that contains more than permitted levels of lead  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  polybrominated biphenyl pbb and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde 
the rohs directive does not apply to units of equipment already placed on the eu market prior to july  in addition  the rohs directive contains exemptions for a certain types of equipment  b reuse of equipment placed on the eu market prior to july   and c spare parts for the repair of equipment placed on the eu market prior to july  the state of california also has adopted restrictions on the use of certain materials in electronic products that are intended to harmonize with the rohs directive 
those restrictions went into effect in other us states are considering similar legislation or are in the process of implementing enacted legislation 
similarly  china has promulgated environmental regulations covering the same substances as the rohs directive 
china s regulations became effective on march  and imposed various marking and substance content disclosures above defined thresholds of electronic products imported into china 
we have implemented a program to comply with these requirements 
china has not yet defined the list of specific products for which the substance content will be restricted or the effective date of any imposed restrictions 
it is unclear whether china s use restrictions will be consistent with the use restrictions set forth in the rohs directive 
other countries outside of the eu and china are in various stages of establishing rohs requirements and may adopt rohs type regulations in the future 
in addition  the state of california adopted restrictions on the energy efficiency of external alternating current power supplies used with many of the products we manufacture and sell 
no significant costs were incurred in for our product and system re certification to us requirements due to migration to newer  more efficient power supplies 
additional certification costs may be incurred in and beyond as similar requirements are adopted in other countries in which we sell or intend to sell 
we have redesigned some of our current products to bring them into compliance with the rohs directive and similar regulations in other jurisdictions 
in other cases  we are replacing non compliant products with new products that comply with these regulations 
no costs other than planned r d expenditures were incurred in to comply with these regulations 
we expect to incur additional costs in the future for compliance with the rohs directive and similar regulations in other jurisdictions 
the amount and timing of such expenditures are uncertain due to uncertainties about the effective date and final content of rohs type regulations in various jurisdictions and the possibility that rohs type regulations in one jurisdiction will not be consistent with rohs type regulations in other jurisdictions 
radio emissions are the subject of governmental regulation in all countries in which we currently conduct or expect to conduct business 
in north america  both the canadian and us governments publish radio emission regulations and changes thereto after public hearings 
in other countries  regulatory changes can be introduced with little or no grace period for implementation 
furthermore  there is little consistency among the regulations of various countries 
future regulatory changes in north america  china and other jurisdictions are possible 
these conditions introduce uncertainty into our product planning process and could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our wireless products in a given country or adversely affect our cost of supplying wireless products in a given country 
raw materials we use a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  and we obtain such raw materials from a variety of suppliers 
in general  the raw materials we use are available from numerous alternative sources 
as is customary for our industry  we at various times enter into certain single source component part supply agreements 
we believe these agreements will be renewed in the ordinary course of business 
item a 
risk factors you are encouraged to review the discussion of forward looking statements and risk factors appearing in this report at part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
in addition to the other information set forth in this report  you should carefully consider the following factors  which could materially affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
the risks described in this report are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
macroeconomic conditions beyond our control could lead to decreases in demand for our products  reduced profitability or deterioration in the quality of our accounts receivable 
domestic and international political and economic conditions are uncertain due to a variety of factors  including global  regional and national economic downturns  the availability and cost of credit  volatility in stock and credit markets  energy costs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates the risk of global conflict  the risk of terrorism and war in a given country or region  and public health issues 
our business depends on our customers demand for our products and services  the general economic health of current and prospective customers  and their desire or ability to make investments in technology 
a deterioration of global  regional or local political or economic conditions could affect potential customers in a way that reduces demand for our products and disrupts our manufacturing and sales plans 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may negatively impact reported revenue and expenses 
in addition  our sales are typically made on unsecured credit terms that are generally consistent with the prevailing business practices in the country in which the customer is located 
a deterioration of political or economic conditions in a given country or region could reduce or eliminate our ability to collect accounts receivable in that country or region 
in any of these events  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we face risks as a global company that could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations 
due to the global nature of our business  we face risks that companies operating in a single country or region do not have 
us and foreign government restrictions on the export or import of technology could prevent us from selling some or all of our products in one or more countries 
our sales could also be materially and adversely affected by burdensome laws  regulations  security requirements  tariffs  quotas  taxes  trade barriers or capital flow restrictions imposed by the us or foreign governments 
in addition  political and economic instability in a particular country or region could reduce demand for our products or impair or eliminate our ability to sell or deliver those products to customers in those countries or put our assets at risk 
any of the foregoing factors could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand sales of our products in any market  and disruptions of our sales could materially and adversely impact our revenues  revenue growth  gross profit margins and results of operations 
a significant percentage of our products and components for those products are designed  manufactured  produced  delivered  serviced or supported in countries outside of the us from time to time  we contract with companies outside of the us to perform one or more of these activities  or portions of these activities 
for operational  legal or other reasons  we may have to change the mix of domestic and international operations or move outsourced activities from one overseas vendor to another 
in addition  us or foreign government actions or economic or political instability and potentially weaker foreign intellectual property protections may disrupt or require changes in our international operations or international outsourcing arrangements 
the process of implementing such changes and dealing with such disruptions is complex and can be expensive 
there is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these tasks in an efficient or cost effective manner  if at all 
if we encounter difficulties in making such transitions  our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
due to our global operations  our cash flows  revenue and earnings are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our international sales are typically quoted  billed and collected in the customer s local currency  and therefore exposed to changes in exchange rates 
our product costs are largely denominated in us dollars  and as such  do not significantly change with exchange rate fluctuations 
exchange rate fluctuations may also affect the cost of goods and services that we purchase and personnel we employ 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to exchange rate changes by entering into short term currency exchange contracts 
there is no assurance that we will hedge or will be able to hedge such foreign currency exchange risk or that our hedges will be successful 
item a 
risk factors continued our currency exchange gains or losses net of hedges may materially and adversely impact our cash flows and earnings 
additionally  adverse movements in currency exchange rates could result in increases in our cost of goods sold or reduction in growth in international orders  materially impacting our cash flows and earnings 
we are dependent on venture corporation limited for the manufacture of substantially all of our products and any failure or inability of venture to provide its manufacturing services to us would adversely affect our business 
in relying on venture to assemble our products  we will no longer have direct physical control over the manufacturing process and operations 
this might adversely affect our ability to control the quality of our products and the timeliness of their delivery to our customers 
either of those potential consequences could adversely affect our customer relationships and our revenues 
furthermore  venture s access to our intellectual property could possibly increase the risk of infringement or misappropriation of our assets 
if venture were unable to manufacture our products at one or more of its facilities for any extended period  we would be required to obtain alternative sources of manufacturing 
there is no assurance that any such sources would be available in a timely manner or at comparable cost 
any such interruption of venture s manufacturing capabilities could increase our costs  impair our ability to provide our customers with our products in a timely and efficient manner and adversely affect our customer relationships and our financial results 
the transition of our manufacturing to foreign jurisdictions could also result in operational risk as well as customer concerns regarding product quality and delivery schedules during the transition period 
we expect to complete the transition in the first quarter of however  completion of the transition could be delayed by foreign or us regulatory requirements or other unforeseen events 
if the transition is inefficient or delayed  our sales and income could be adversely affected 
venture s use of third party suppliers could adversely affect our product quality  delivery schedules or customer satisfaction  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
third party suppliers that we approve will be providing the components that venture will use in the final assembly of our products 
some of these components may be available only from a single source or limited sources  and if they become unavailable for any reason  we or venture may be unable to obtain alternative sources of supply on a timely basis 
our products may also be adversely affected by the quality control of these third party suppliers or by their inability to meet delivery deadlines 
failure of these third party suppliers in any of these respects may negatively affect our revenue and customer relationships 
furthermore  these suppliers may have access to our intellectual property  which may increase the risk of infringement or misappropriation 
our reliance on third party distributors could adversely affect our business  revenues and earnings 
in addition to offering our products to certain customers and resellers directly  we rely to a significant and increasing degree on third party distributors and integrators to sell our products to end users 
in and  one distributor  scansource  inc  accounted for more than of our sales  and it or other distributors may account for a substantial portion of our sales in the future 
changes in markets  customers or products  or negative developments in general economic and financial conditions and the availability of credit  may adversely affect the ability of these distributors to effectively bring our products to market at the right time and in the right locations 
in addition  if a significant distributor  such as scansource  were to become unavailable or substantially reduce its purchases from us  we would be required to obtain alternative sources of distribution or enhance our internal sales force 
such a disruption in the distribution of our products could impair or delay sales of our products to end users and increase our costs of distribution  which could adversely affect our sales or income 
growth of and changes in our revenues and profits depend on the customer  product and geographic mix of our sales 
fluctuations in our sales mix could have an adverse impact on or increase the volatility of our revenues  gross margins and profits 
sales to large enterprises tend to have lower prices and gross margins than sales to smaller firms 
in addition  our gross margins vary depending on the product or service and the geographic region in which sales are made 
growth in our revenues and gross margins therefore depends on the customer  product and geographic mix of our sales 
if we are unable to execute a sales strategy that results in a favorable sales mix  our revenues  gross margins and earnings may decline 
further  changes in the mix of our sales from quarter to quarter or year to year may make our revenues  gross margins and earnings more volatile and difficult to predict

risk factors continued our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to transform our supply chain  improve our business processes and systems and attract and retain skilled managers and employees 
in order to increase sales and profits  we must continue to expand our operations into new product and geographic markets and deepen our penetration of the markets we currently serve  and do so in efficient and cost effective ways 
to achieve our objectives  we need to continue to streamline our supply chain and our business processes and continue to improve our financial  information technology and enterprise resource planning systems 
to accomplish this  there may be times when we must significantly restructure our business and recognize the anticipated costs of such restructurings 
such restructuring charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
competition for skilled employees is high in our industry  and we must remain competitive in terms of compensation and other employee benefits to retain key employees 
if we are unsuccessful in hiring and retaining skilled managers and employees  we will be unable to achieve the objectives of our restructuring programs or to maintain and expand our business 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  and our success depends upon the timely introduction of new products and our ability to mitigate the risk of product obsolescence 
customer requirements for aidc products are rapidly evolving and technological changes in our industry occur rapidly 
to keep up with new customer requirements and distinguish intermec from our competitors  we must frequently introduce new products and enhancements of existing products through potentially significant investments in research and development r d 
we may not have adequate resources to invest in r d that will keep pace with technological changes in our industry  and any such investments may not result in competitive products 
furthermore  we may not be able to launch new products before our competition launches comparable products 
any of these factors could cause our business to suffer 
rapid technological change  whether through our or our competitors introduction of new products or technologies  could also render our products obsolete and result in substantial excess inventories 
in such event  we might have to sell all or a portion of the excess or obsolete inventory at a substantial discount to the planned resale price or the cost of making or acquiring that inventory and write off the difference 
if our response to technological changes and our ability to introduce new products and product enhancements is not effective  and we do not mitigate the risk of product obsolescence  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
our failure to expand our patent portfolio or to successfully protect our intellectual property rights and defend against infringement claims could adversely affect the growth of our business and our results of operations 
one element of our strategy to compete in our industry is to expand our aidc patent portfolio to differentiate our products from those of our competitors and to generate royalty income 
the expansion of a patent portfolio involves a complex and costly set of activities with uncertain outcomes 
our ability to obtain patents can be adversely affected by insufficient inventiveness of our employees  by changes in patent laws  treaties  and regulations  and by judicial and administrative interpretations of those laws treaties and regulations 
our ability to expand our patent portfolio can also be adversely affected by the lack of valuable patents for sale or license at affordable prices 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain valuable aidc patents in the jurisdictions where we and our competitors operate or that we will be able to use or license those patents to differentiate our products in the marketplace or to generate meaningful royalty revenue 
to protect our patent portfolio  we may be required to initiate patent infringement lawsuits 
patent lawsuits are complex proceedings  and the results are very difficult to predict 
there is no assurance that we will prevail in all or any of these cases 
adverse results in such patent lawsuits could give competitors the legal right to compete with us and with our licensees using technology that is similar to or the same as ours 
adverse outcomes in patent lawsuits could also reduce our royalty revenues 
in some periods  patent litigation recoveries and expenses could result in large fluctuations from prior periods  increasing the volatility of our financial results and possibly impacting our earnings per share 
since our business strategy includes global expansion  we are operating in developing countries eg  china where the institutional structures for creating and enforcing intellectual property rights are very new or non existent and where government agencies  courts and market participants have little experience with intellectual property rights 
there is no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology in such countries because we may not be able to obtain or enforce patents or other intellectual property rights in those jurisdictions and alternative methods of protecting our technology may not be effective 
our inability to prevent competitors in these developing markets from misappropriating our technology could materially and adversely affect our sales  revenues and results of operations 
our competitors  potential competitors and companies that purchase and enforce patents may have patents covering aidc products and services similar to those we market and sell 
these firms may try to use their patents to prevent us from selling some of our aidc products  to collect royalties from us with respect to sales of products they claim are covered by their patents  or to deter us from enforcing our patents against them 
as part of this effort  the patent holders may initiate patent infringement lawsuits against us or our customers 
these lawsuits are complex proceedings with uncertain outcomes 
there is no assurance that we or our customers will prevail in any item a 
risk factors continued patent lawsuits initiated by third party patent holders 
if the results of such litigation are adverse to us or our customers  we could be enjoined from practicing an invention covered by the patent in question 
we could also be required to pay damages for past infringement  which might have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if an injunction is issued  we may not be able to sell a particular product or product line  which could materially and adversely impact our sales  revenues and results of operations 
if third party patent holders are willing to license or sell their patents to us  or if we must redesign the affected products  the associated costs could have a material and adverse effect on our sales  revenues or results of operations 
some of our competitors are substantially larger or more profitable than we are  which may give them a competitive advantage 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
due to acquisitions and other consolidation of the aidc industry  competition is likely to intensify 
some of our competitors have substantially more revenue or profit than we do 
the scale advantage of these companies may allow them to invest more in r d  sales and marketing  and customer support than we can or to achieve economies of scale in manufacturing and distribution 
the scale advantage may also allow them to acquire or make complementary products that alone or in combination with other aidc products could afford them a competitive advantage 
these advantages may enable our larger competitors to weather market downturns longer or adapt more quickly to emerging technology developments  market trends or price declines than we can 
those competitors may also be able to precipitate such market changes by introducing new technologies  reducing their prices or otherwise changing their activities 
there is no assurance that our strategies to counteract our competitors advantages will successfully offset all or a portion of this scale imbalance 
if we are unable to offset all or a significant portion of this imbalance  our earnings may be materially and adversely affected 
business combinations  private equity transactions and similar events are altering the structure of the aidc industry and  could intensify competition and create other risks for our business 
large  well financed companies and private equity groups have been acquiring companies in aidc industry 
as examples  motorola acquired symbol technologies  inc  honeywell acquired hand held products  inc 
and metrologic holdings corporation  parent of metrologic instruments  and zebra technologies acquired wherenet  navis holdings llc and proveo ag 
these acquisitions and other similar events have altered the structure of the aidc industry and may spawn more transactions and additional structural changes 
these events could intensify competition within the aidc industry by expanding the presence of companies that have greater business and financial resources than the firms they acquired and by increasing the market share of some companies in our industry 
such increased competition could have material adverse impacts to our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
there is no assurance that any of the strategies we employ to react to the structural changes and related increased competition in our industry will be successful 
growth in our revenues and profits depends  in part  on development of the rfid market 
there is uncertainty about the volume and the timing of demand for rfid products in the vertical markets and applications that we and our licensees target 
potential rfid customers typically use pilot programs  qualification processes and certification processes to determine whether to acquire an rfid system and which vendor s products and systems to buy 
we cannot predict how fast the rfid market will grow or how large it will become 
if it grows into a significant market  we and our licensees may not be able to successfully penetrate that market with our rfid product offerings 
if the rfid market does not grow significantly or if we and our licensees are unable to successfully penetrate that market  our revenue growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
to compete effectively in the aidc industry  we may seek to acquire or make investments in other businesses  patents  technologies  products or services  and our failure to do so successfully may adversely affect our competitive position or financial results 
the industry trend toward business combinations and other factors may make it appropriate for us to acquire or make investments in other businesses  patents  technologies  products or services 
our ability to do so could be hampered if we are unable to identify suitable acquisitions and investments or to agree on the terms of any such acquisition or investment 
we may not be able to consummate any such transaction if we cannot obtain financing at a reasonable cost and lack sufficient resources to finance the transaction on our own 
if we are not able to complete such transactions  our competitive position may suffer  which could have adverse impacts on our revenues  revenue growth and results of operations 
our business combinations or other transactions may not succeed in generating the intended benefits and therefore adversely affect shareholder value or our financial results 
integration of new businesses or technologies into our business may have any of the following adverse effects we may have difficulty transitioning customers and other business relationships to intermec 
we may have problems unifying management of a combined company 
we may lose key employees from our existing or acquired businesses 
we may experience intensified competition from other companies seeking to expand sales and market share during the integration period 
item a 
risk factors continued furthermore  in order to complete such transactions  we may have to use cash  issue new equity securities with dilutive effects on existing shareholders  take on new debt  assume contingent liabilities or amortize assets or expenses in a manner that has a material adverse effect on our balance sheet or results of operations 
we may also consume considerable management time and attention on the integration that would divert resources from the development and operation of our existing business 
these and other potential problems could prevent us from realizing the benefits of such transactions and have a material adverse impact on our revenues  revenue growth  balance sheet and results of operations 
global regulation and regulatory compliance  including environmental  technological and standards setting regulations  may limit our sales or increase our costs  which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
we are subject to domestic and international technical and environmental standards and regulations that govern or influence the design  components or operation of our products 
such standards and regulations may also require us to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products 
our ability to sell aidc products in a given country and the gross margins on products sold in a given country could be affected by such regulations 
we are also subject to self imposed standards setting activities sponsored by organizations such as iso  aim  ieee and epcglobal that provide our customers with the ability to seamlessly use our products with products from other aidc vendors  which our customers demand 
changes in standards and regulations may be introduced at any time and with little or no time to bring products into compliance with the revised technical standard or regulation 
standards and regulations may prevent us from selling one or more of our products in a particular country  increase our cost of supplying our products by requiring us to redesign existing products or to use more expensive designs or components  require us to obtain services or create infrastructure in a particular country to address collection  recycling and similar obligations  or require us to license our patents on a royalty free basis and prevent us from seeking damages and injunctive relief for patent infringements 
in these cases  we may experience unexpected disruptions in our ability to supply customers with our products or may have to incur unexpected costs to bring our products into compliance 
due to these uncertainties and compliance burdens  our customers may postpone or cancel purchases of our products 
as a result  global regulation and compliance could have an adverse effect on our revenues  gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results 
seasonal variations in demand could increase the volatility of our financial results 
our revenues are affected by the seasonality of technology purchases and the timing of the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products 
our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products and services  as our revenues are historically highest in the fourth fiscal quarter and the lowest in the first fiscal quarter 
revenues may also decline in quarters when our customers are anticipating new product introductions or significant product enhancements  but may increase significantly in quarters when we announce those product introductions or enhancements 
these fluctuations in demand may also impact our ability to manufacture and distribute products in an efficient manner 
any of these factors could increase the volatility of our revenues  gross margins and results of operations from one period to another 
our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results 
due to the global nature of our business  we are subject to national and local taxation in many different countries  and we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by the tax authorities in those countries 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
there is no assurance that all or any of these tax audits will be resolved in our favor 
in addition  under applicable accounting rules  the value that we report for our deferred tax assets reflects our estimate for these assets  net of those that we believe are more likely than not to expire before being utilized 
our financial results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities or deferred tax assets in the periods when the tax assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitations on the tax assessments or tax attributes expire 
the outcome of these tax assessments or estimates could have a material positive or negative impact on our earnings and increase the volatility of our earnings relative to prior periods

the increase in revenues from systems and solutions was offset by a million  or  decline in our printer and media revenue for the comparable periods 
the decrease in printer and media revenue in was primarily related to less revenue in latin america  which had a number of large direct accounts that included significant printer revenue in product revenues in europe  the middle east and africa emea were flat in compared to  which includes approximately million from favorable changes in currency exchange rates in compared to product revenue in the rest of the world row decreased  primarily due to lower product revenue in latin america  which had a number of large direct accounts in product revenues in were flat compared to the growth in our system and solutions revenues of million  or  compared to  was offset by an million  or  decline in our printer and media revenue for the comparable periods 
the growth in systems and solutions resulted from growth rates of and in emea and row  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in north america 
the higher systems and solutions revenue in emea during was primarily attributable to strong market acceptance of new product introductions and a refreshed product line to be in compliance with the european union s reduction of hazardous substances rohs directive 
the growth in emea revenue also includes approximately million  or  from favorable changes in currency exchange rates in compared to the lower systems and solutions revenue in north america during compared to reflects declining revenues in the first half of  as a result of lower enterprise sales and delays in customer purchases during our transition to newly introduced products  partially offset by growth in the fourth quarter of compared to the corresponding period 
service revenues of million for were down million  or compared to we experienced higher service revenue in emea  which was more than offset by lower service revenue in north america and latin america compared to the decrease in north america service revenues is primarily a result of lower time and material repairs 
service revenues of million for were essentially flat with we experienced higher service revenue in emea and latin america during  primarily from the regional growth in product revenues  which was offset by a decrease in us government professional services and declines in time and material repairs 
geographically  for the year ended december   product and service revenues increased in north america by  while emea remained flat and row decreased 
the growth in north america revenue is primarily attributable to strong system and solutions revenue 
the revenue decrease in row is primarily attributable to lower product revenue in latin america  which had a number of large direct accounts in for  product and service revenue decreased in north america by  while emea and row increased by and  respectively 
the growth in emea revenue is primarily attributable to strong market acceptance of new products and million  or  from favorable changes in currency exchange rates in compared to the revenue growth in row is primarily attributable to several large enterprise sales in latin american and approximately million  or  due to favorable changes in currency exchange rates

the increase in product gross margins is primarily a result of a higher proportion of our product revenue from systems and solutions  the favorable impact from foreign exchange rate movements  component cost reductions and higher capacity utilization related to the revenue growth 
service gross profit decreased by million  or  in compared to due primarily to the decrease in related revenue 
total gross profit for the year ended december   decreased million  or  compared to the prior year end 
product gross profit decreased by million  or  in compared to  due primarily to the basis point decrease in gross margin percentage 
service gross profit decreased by million  or  in compared to due to the basis point reduction in gross margin

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expense in millions year ended december  amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount selling  general and administrative expense the increase in selling  general and administrative expense sg a in of million compared to is primarily attributable to a million increase for information systems expense  primarily resulting from higher depreciation expense and consulting costs  as a result of our erp upgrade  a million increase due to the impact of international costs translated to us dollars at less favorable average exchange rates during  a million increase in foreign exchange contract and re measurement losses  and higher labor costs 
the decrease in sg a of million in compared to primarily reflects a million reduction in our us pension and post retirement expense as a result of the changes to our us plans in flood related charges in june  our cedar rapids  iowa facilities were flooded  and we incurred damages to both a facility that we own and one that we lease 
a portion of these damages was covered by insurance 
while the flood caused significant damage  we were able to redirect the work done by our cedar rapids groups to temporary locations  and therefore the flood did not cause a significant interruption of our business

gains on intellectual property settlements in march  we settled an intellectual property ip lawsuit relating to our battery power management patents 
ip settlements relating to the battery power management patents have been reached to date with companies that  in the aggregate  represent over ninety percent of us laptop sales 
we are involved in various other patent infringement lawsuits that may result in future revenue or gains and operating profit 
management cannot predict the outcome  timing or amount of future settlements or judgments in ip lawsuits 
there were no ip settlements for the years ended december  or the net pretax gain from an ip settlement included in operating profits was million in restructuring costs in july  we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to reduce our cost structure and streamline operations 
pursuant to this plan  we relocated the final assembly of our product lines from everett  washington  to venture corporation limited  a global electronics services provider 
as part of the plan we have consolidated two us service depots to existing locations in charlotte  north carolina and monterey  mexico and transferred our on site field service repair to a third party supplier 
we commenced implementation of the plan in the third quarter of and expect the plan to be fully implemented in the first half of as of december   employees have been terminated as part of the restructuring 
we expect all severance and other periodic transitional costs will be cash expenditures

the activities previously assigned to the design centers in sweden were reassigned to other parts of our business or moved to third party vendors to improve efficiencies and reduce costs 
in addition to the anticipated cost savings  this realignment of resources is expected to increase new product development capacity 
this restructuring activity was substantially completed by the end of on november   we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to reduce costs  streamline operations and improve productivity 
the restructuring included headcount reductions and consolidation of certain facilities on a regional and or global basis

on january   we committed to a business restructuring plan intended to reorganize our sales function and to reduce our operating cost structure and improve efficiency 
we believe these actions are appropriate strategically and are prudent changes in view of the generally weakened global economy and uncertain market conditions expected in the foreseeable future 
we expect to implement this plan over the next six months and to reduce our workforce by approximately employees worldwide 
a majority of the headcount reductions will be made in the united states 
the total restructuring costs are expected to be in a pre tax range of million to million  including employee termination costs of approximately million  and million to million of other restructuring costs 
we expect to record most of the restructuring charge in the first quarter of  and the remainder in the second quarter of we anticipate that all of the severance related and periodic transitional costs will be cash expenditures

the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   reflects an effective tax rate for continuing operations of  compared to a us statutory provision rate of 
the effective tax rate exceeded the statutory tax rate primarily due to state taxes and nondeductible incentive stock based compensation  which was partially offset by research tax credit benefits 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   reflects an effective tax rate for continuing operations of  compared to a us statutory provision rate of 
the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the settlement of foreign tax audits 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued foreign currency transactions and effect of foreign exchange rates we are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations

if an event of default occurs and is continuing  then the interest rate on all obligations under the revolving facility may be increased by above the otherwise applicable rate  and the bank may declare any outstanding obligations under the revolving facility to be immediately due and payable 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued a fee ranging from to on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each letter of credit that is issued and outstanding under the revolving facility 
the fee on the unused portion of the revolving facility ranges from to 
certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving facility 
the revolving facility contains various restrictions and covenants  including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to consolidate or merge  make acquisitions  create liens  incur additional indebtedness or dispose of assets 
financial covenants include a maximum leverage test and a minimum tangible net worth test  each as defined in the revolving facility 
in march  we paid off the remaining million of our million principal amount  senior unsecured debt that was sold in we believe that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  combined with projected cash flow from operations  will provide adequate funding to meet our expected working capital  capital expenditure and restructuring cost requirements for the foreseeable future 
projected cash flows from operations are largely based on our revenue estimates  cost estimates  and the related timing of cash receipts and cash disbursements 
if actual performance differs from estimated performance  cash flow from operations could be positively or negatively impacted 
an additional source of liquidity includes our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments for continuing operations as of december  millions of dollars 
the table does not include amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities 
operating leases are discussed in the indicated note to our consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases note d purchase commitments total contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million at december  has been omitted from the table above  because we cannot determine with certainty when this liability will be settled 
expected future benefit payments by our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million for the subsequent five year period through item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had aggregate off balance sheet letter of credit reimbursement agreements totaling million  compared to million at december  we do not believe that these letter of credit reimbursement agreements have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
inflation in our opinion  inflation has not been a significant factor in the markets in which we operate in  or and has not had a significant impact upon the results of our operations during these fiscal years 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant estimates and assumptions were used to determine the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable  excess and obsolete inventory  tax valuation allowances  uncertain tax positions  recoverability of other intangible assets  warranty costs  pension and postretirement obligations  fair value of pension assets  and stock based compensation 
despite these inherent limitations  we believe that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and our financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recorded when the revenue is earned  the amount due is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
service and maintenance revenue is recognized as services are rendered  generally over the contract term  and collectability is reasonably assured 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as large deals that include both products and services  the entire revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
fair value for each element is established based on the sales price charged when the same element is sold separately 
we reduce revenue for estimated customer returns  price protection  rebates and other offerings that occur under sales programs established by us directly or with our distributors and resellers 
we accrue the estimated cost of post sale obligations  including basic product warranties  based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
we typically do not sell our software products without the related hardware 
our typical products require no significant production  modification or customization of the software or hardware after they are shipped 
for software sales  and hardware sales where the software is more than incidental  revenue is recognized upon shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance of the product  as defined in the customer contract 
under our rapid start rfid intellectual property rfid ip licensing program  we license rights to use portions of our ip portfolio  including certain patents essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain rfid products and systems 
licensees participating in the rapid start program typically paid a nonrefundable up front fee and agreed to pay ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed rfid ip 
under the terms of such rapid start rfid license agreements  the licensees receive the right to certain future divisions  continuations and continuations in part of the licensed rfid patents 
non refundable up front fees and license transfer fees related to our rapid start rfid ip licensing program are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over five years  representing the estimated future period we expect to receive patents on certain divisions  continuations and or continuations in part for the licensed rfid patents and our estimate of the average technology lifecycle for the aidc industry 
we earn royalties on licensed rfid products sold by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees report and pay royalties owed for sales made in any given quarter after the conclusion of that quarter 
we recognize such royalty revenue in the period earned and reported from licensees 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
changes in the financial condition of our customers could result in upward or downward adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued inventory obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than our assumptions  additional inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if previously written down inventory is sold 
income taxes 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent  feasible and permissible tax planning strategies in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if we were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there are currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
we conduct business in various countries throughout the world and are subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions 
as a result of our business activities  we file a significant number of tax returns that are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
tax audits are often complex and may require several years to resolve 
we also record benefits from uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
accordingly  we recognize the largest amount of benefit greater than determined by cumulative probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
such amounts are based on management s judgment and best estimate as to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
a majority of our finite lived intangible assets pertain to a portion of our patent portfolio and have estimated that those patents have useful lives of up to years 
see note e to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually in our th quarter or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
warranty costs 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information on the nature  frequency  and average cost of warranty claims 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if undiscounted expected cash flows to be generated by a long lived asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount  we record an impairment to write down the long lived asset or asset group to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
we have recorded approximately million of impairment loss for certain property for the year ended december  derivative instruments and hedging activities 
due to our global operations  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to risks related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our treasury policies allow us to hedge major foreign currency cash flow exposures through the purchase of foreign exchange forward contracts at amounts up to of such cash flows 
when our hedges are designated as effective cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activties as amended any translation gains and losses on the effective portion of the hedging instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income oci 
all derivative instruments not designated as effective hedges under sfas no 
are recorded at fair value  with changes in value recognized in earnings in the period of change and the fair values of derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
the difference between the net fair values of foreign exchange contracts and the underlying foreign currency based assets and liabilities was million as of december  patent costs 
we capitalize external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents where we believe that the future economic benefit of the patent will be increased in accordance with statement of financial accounting concepts  elements of financial statements 
we monitor the legal costs incurred and the anticipated outcome of the legal action and  if changes in the anticipated outcome occur  capitalized costs are charged to the period in which the change is determined 
patent costs are amortized over the remaining useful life of the patents 
as of december  and  million and million of legal patent defense costs have been capitalized 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued pension and other postretirement benefits 
we have retirement plans that cover most of our employees 
some of these plans were frozen june annual employer contributions are made to the extent such contributions are actuarially determined to adequately fund the plans  and to match a portion of the employees contributions 
retiree benefits are based on the amount of participant contributions over the term of the participant s employment 
assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other postretirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant internal data  such as the rate of increase in compensation levels and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
critical assumptions such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost projections are evaluated and updated annually 
note k to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates for our domestic and foreign plans 
we believe the assumptions are appropriate 
however  these assumptions could vary materially from actual results due to economic events or different rates of retirement  mortality or withdrawal  positively or negatively impacting future results of operations 
the discount rate  used to discount future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date  reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments 
the discount rates for domestic and foreign plans for the fifteen months ended december  were and respectively  compared to and as for the twelve months ended september  the decrease in the discount rate used for domestic plans reflects lower interest rates in the current market 
a one half percentage point decrease in our discount rate on pension cost would result in an increase in benefit obligation of million 
to determine the expected long term rate of return  we use historic market trends combined with current market conditions 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on our domestic and foreign plans was and  respectively 
the effect on our pension cost of a one half percentage point decrease in the expected long term rate of return would be an increase of million 
we determine the expected rate of compensation increase based on historic trends and comparisons to external rates 
for domestic plans  we concluded that no adjustment to the expected rate of compensation increase was necessary and continued to use 
for foreign plans  we concluded that no adjustment to the expected rate of compensation was necessary as there are no active employees covered under the plans 
actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated benefit obligation for other postretirement benefits include a discount rate of  and at december   and  respectively 
the effect on our postretirement benefit cost of one half percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be immaterial 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for fiscal year was and is projected to decrease over nineteen years to  where it is expected to remain thereafter 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is not material 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate on the postretirement benefit obligation would result in an increase of approximately million  while a one percentage point decrease would result in a decrease of million 
effective december   we adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 
 which required that the consolidated statements of financial position reflect the funded status of the pension and postretirement plans see note k  pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the difference between actual amounts and estimates based on actuarial assumptions is recognized in other comprehensive income loss in the period in which they occur 
contingencies 
we assess our exposure to loss contingencies  including environmental  legal and income tax matters  and provide for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from our estimates  results of operations are adjusted upward or downward 
stock based compensation 
as of december   we had four stock based compensation plans available for future grants 
prior to january   these plans are accounted for under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
during the first quarter of  we began expensing stock options as required under sfas no 
r  share based payments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued stock based compensation represents the cost related to stock based awards granted to employees 
we measure stock based compensation cost at grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and recognize the cost as expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the employee s requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the expense is recorded in cost of revenues and sg a in the consolidated statement of operations based on the employees respective functions 
we record deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and our statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a deduction 
differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax return are recorded in additional paid in capital if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset or in the consolidated statement of earnings if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paid in capital exists from previous awards

you are encouraged to review the risk factors portion of item a of part i of this filing which discusses the risk factors associated with our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from our short term and long term borrowings and to foreign exchange rate risk with respect to our foreign operations and from foreign currency transactions 
interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term and long term borrowings 
during march  we paid off our million fixed rate senior unsecured debt 
see discussions of our credit facilities under the heading liquidity and capital resources in item of this annual report on form k and in note b to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
currency exchange rates due to our global operations  our cash flow and earnings are exposed to risk based on movements in foreign exchange rates 
we conduct business in approximately countries throughout the world and generally invoice customers in their local currency and have a resulting foreign currency denominated revenue transaction and accounts receivable balance 
we also purchase certain raw materials and other items in foreign currencies 
when appropriate  we may attempt to limit our exposure to changing currency exchange rates by entering into short term forward contracts 
we do not enter into any forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
when the forward contracts effectively meet the risk reduction and correlation criteria established in sfas no 
we apply hedge accounting  and accordingly  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are included in other comprehensive income 
in those circumstances where our hedges do not meet the effective hedge criteria and it is not appropriate to account for the forward contracts as hedges  gains and losses from mark to market adjustments are recorded in earnings 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent movement in currency exchange rates applied to the exposure described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that if our hedges of exchange exposure were not in place  such market movements would have an impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ significantly from that analysis  however  based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and currency exchange rate movements and our actual exposures and hedging activities 
during  our revenue consisted of million or  denominated in us dollars  million  or  denominated in euros  million  or  denominated in british pounds  and million  or denominated in other foreign currencies 
fluctuations in foreign currency translation rates positively impacted our revenue by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  in comparison to the corresponding prior year
