item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we encourage you to read this md a in conjunction with our financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k and the risk factors contained in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
executive summary we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel prescription pain management products 
on may   the us food and drug administration fda approved our first product  entereg alvimopan  for the management of postoperative ileus following bowel resection surgery poi 
poi causes significant discomfort for patients and results in increased expense to healthcare providers 
entereg is specifically indicated to accelerate the time to upper and lower gastrointestinal gi recovery following partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis 
we also have a number of product candidates in various stages of clinical and preclinical development 
for the year ended december   our total revenues and net loss were million and million  respectively 
net shipments of entereg through december  were million  of which we recognized million as net product sales under our revenue recognition policy 
we will need to grow sales of entereg significantly beyond current levels before we will be able to achieve profitability and positive cash flow from operations 
the rate of our future growth will depend on  among other things  the acceptance of entereg in the marketplace  our ability to maintain adequate intellectual property protection for entereg and our success in developing and commercializing additional product candidates 
ultimately  we may never generate significant product sales revenues  achieve profitable operations or generate positive cash flows from operations and  even if profitable operations are achieved  they may not be sustained on a continuing basis or sufficient to generate the operating cash flow to support our current or projected levels of operation 
entereg for poi together with our partner  glaxo group limited glaxo  we launched entereg in the united states in mid entereg is detailed primarily by glaxo s national hospital based sales organization 
we are co promoting entereg in certain hospitals with a field force that we expect will number persons by mid entereg was approved in poi subject to a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems under which the product is available only to hospitals that perform bowel resections and are enrolled in the entereg access support and education ease program 
our initial launch efforts focused on registering hospitals in the ease program 
as of december   approximately  hospitals had registered  and of those  approximately had approved entereg for inclusion on their formularies 
under our agreement with glaxo  we have a profit sharing arrangement under which we receive and glaxo receives of profits  as defined 
profits are calculated as net sales of entereg for poi less certain agreed upon costs and is subject to certain adjustments 
beginning in mid  the parties will share such profits equally 
in  glaxo and we are undertaking a number of initiatives to potentially increase the awareness and acceptance of entereg among hospitals and physicians performing bowel resection surgeries 
these efforts will include studies intending to address pharmacoeconomic and health outcomes associated with accelerated gi recovery 
longer term  glaxo and we are evaluating additional clinical studies of entereg for poi resulting from pain management following surgical procedures other than bowel resection surgeries 
as required by our fda approval letter for entereg  in february  we began a phase clinical trial intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of entereg for poi in patients undergoing radical cystectomy for bladder cancer 

table of contents delta opioid receptor agonists we are collaborating with pfizer inc pfizer for the development and commercialization of the delta opioid receptor agonist compounds  adl and adl pfizer compounds pf and pf  for the treatment of pain 
the delta receptor is one of three opioid receptors that modulate pain 
today  all marketed opioid drugs interact primarily with the mu receptor 
we have identified a series of novel  orally active delta agonists that selectively stimulate the delta opioid receptor 
our goal is to develop medications that produce pain relief similar to traditional mu opioids  while reducing or eliminating some typical narcotic side effects 
we have completed three phase a studies of the initial formulation of adl in i acute pain after surgical removal of impacted third molars  ii pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis and iii pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy 
while adl was well tolerated in these studies  adl showed no statistically significant difference versus placebo in these trials 
before commencing additional clinical trials for adl  pfizer and we plan to re formulate adl to address the pharmacokinetic variability observed in these phase a trials 
we recently completed enrollment in an adl multiple ascending dose phase trial in healthy volunteers  and did not observe any dose limiting toxicity or serious adverse events 
pfizer and we intend to initiate proof of concept trials of adl later in opioid bowel dysfunction program there are opioid receptors in the gi tract  or peripheral opioid receptors  that regulate functions such as motility and water secretion and absorption 
stimulation of these gi mu opioid receptors by morphine  or other opioid analgesics  can slow gut motility and disrupt normal gi function that allows for the passage  absorption and excretion of ingested solid materials 
in patients who take opioid analgesics to treat chronic and persistent pain  this condition is known as obd 
we are developing adl to treat obd 
adl is a proprietary  small molecule  peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonist intended to block the adverse effects of opioid analgesics on the gi tract without affecting analgesia 
adl has demonstrated safety and efficacy in preclinical models and we are targeting the third quarter of for the submission of an investigational new drug application ind 
we previously were developing alvimopan with glaxo to treat obd 
in september  glaxo returned to us all worldwide rights to alvimopan for the chronic obd indication and  following an internal evaluation and an exploration of partnering opportunities  we announced in december that we will not pursue further development of alvimopan to treat obd 
discovery research and in licensing efforts our pain research efforts initially focused on designing small molecules to target opioid receptors as a means of improving the benefit to risk profile of currently available opioid analgesics 
while work continues on the selective targeting of opioid receptors  we also are seeking to use advancements in molecular biology and medicinal chemistry to design molecules that target other  non opioid  pain receptors and other central nervous system targets 
through our internal discovery effort  we have several product candidates in preclinical development intended to address the treatment of moderate to severe pain 
we believe there may be opportunities to expand our product portfolio through the acquisition or in licensing of products and or product development candidates and intend to continue to explore and evaluate such opportunities 

table of contents the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations as of december  and and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million at december  and approximately million at december   representing and of our total assets  respectively 
we invest excess cash in us treasury obligations 
our working capital  which is calculated as current assets less current liabilities  was million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital was primarily from the use of cash to fund our operating activities 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information for the years ended december   and year ended december  net loss adjustments for non cash operating items net cash operating loss net change in assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in operating activities net operating cash outflows of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  resulted primarily from research and development expenditures associated with our product candidates and selling  general and administrative expenses  offset by payments received under the glaxo and pfizer collaboration agreements 
in  we received million under our collaboration agreements  including a million milestone payment from glaxo following fda approval of entereg for poi 
in addition  we received million of cash related to shipments of entereg during in  we received million under our collaboration agreements  consisting primarily of million received from pfizer upon execution of the collaboration agreement relating to our delta opioid receptor agonists 
in  we received million from glaxo under the collaboration agreement relating to entereg 
net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in investing activities relates to purchases and maturities sales of investment securities  as well as capital expenditures for property and equipment 
capital expenditures are primarily for the purchase of laboratory equipment  furniture and fixtures  office equipment and leasehold improvements associated with our leased facility 
we expect to fund a significant portion of our future operations through the maturities of investments in our portfolio  which consist of us treasury obligations 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash provided from the net maturity sale of available for sale securities in 
table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million of net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided from investing activities in is primarily attributable to a net investment in available for sale securities in resulting from the proceeds received from our equity offering in february net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities was not significant for the years ended december  and net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of  shares of common stock at per share in february we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million 
in addition  we received million from the exercise of stock options in contractual commitments the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total contractual commitments in the table above represent future cash obligations that are legally binding and enforceable under agreements with third parties 
this table summarizes our significant contractual commitments as of december  and the effects such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
excluded from the table above are contingent liabilities associated with various agreements that we have entered into for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates and for consulting and other contracted services 
these contingent liabilities require future performance by the third party in order for payment to be executed  and we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
we estimate that approximately million will be payable in future periods under the arrangements in place at december  of this amount  approximately million has been accrued for work estimated to have been completed as of december  and approximately million relates to future performance under these arrangements 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing agreements 
payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
as of december   the maximum potential milestone payments due under current contractual agreements are million 
glaxo collaboration agreement under the terms of the glaxo agreement  we reimburse glaxo for a portion of certain third party expenses incurred by them relating to entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget which is subject to annual review 
we also incur certain third party expenses ourselves relating to entereg  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget  a portion of which are reimbursable to us by glaxo 
we record these expenses as incurred 

table of contents pfizer collaboration agreement under the terms of the pfizer agreement  we reimburse pfizer for a portion of certain third party expenses incurred by them relating to our delta opioid agonists  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget that is subject to annual review 
we also incur certain third party expenses ourselves relating to the delta opioid agonists  pursuant to an agreed upon development plan and budget  a portion of which is reimbursable to us by pfizer 
we record these expenses as incurred 
license agreement in november  roberts laboratories  inc roberts licensed from eli lilly and company eli lilly certain intellectual property rights relating to entereg 
in june  we entered into an option and license agreement with roberts under which we sublicensed these rights from roberts 
in december  shire us inc became the successor in interests to roberts under our option and license agreement with roberts 
the company has made license and milestone payments under this agreement totaling million  including million paid during as a result of the regulatory approval of entereg 
our license to entereg and our obligations to pay royalties to shire and eli lilly expire on the later of either the date of the last to expire of the licensed eli lilly patents or november  outlook we expect to use our cash  cash equivalents and investments for working capital and to fund our operations 
since inception  we have experienced significant operating losses and negative operating cash flow and have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds received from the sale of our equity securities  as well as from amounts received under collaboration agreements 
our accumulated deficit at december  was million and we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years 
we may never generate significant product sales  achieve profitable operations or generate positive cash flows from operations and  even if profitable operations are achieved  they may not be sustained on a continuing basis or sufficient to support our current or projected levels of operations 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on our product sales  such as the degree of market acceptance  patent protection and exclusivity of entereg  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop  receive approval for and successfully launch our other product candidates 
however  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments are adequate to fund our operations into based upon the level of research and development and marketing and administrative activities we believe will be necessary to achieve our strategic objectives 
we may need to obtain funding for our future operational needs  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
entereg our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations depends  in large part  on our ability to successfully commercialize entereg in the united states 
to that end  we expect that sales and marketing expenses associated with the product will continue to increase during prior to the fda approval of entereg  costs associated with the manufacture of alvimopan were expensed to research and development 
as a result  at december   we have inventory related to alvimopan that carries a zero cost and is not reflected on the december  balance sheet 
certain of this inventory is expected to be used in further research and development activities  with the remaining inventory available for commercial sale 
to the extent that this inventory is sold  our cost of product sales will not reflect costs associated with such product manufacture  and our gross margins will be favorably impacted 
we currently are unable to estimate the timing of the impact to future profitability resulting from the sell through of any inventory manufactured after fda approval of entereg for poi 

table of contents research and development over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products 
during  we expect to continue to incur significant levels of both internal and external research and development expenditures related to our preclinical and clinical product candidates 
we expect to begin or continue a number of clinical programs including  among others  a phase study of entereg for the management of poi in patients undergoing radical cystectomy  additional phase and phase a clinical trials of adl and adl and phase clinical trials for adl we also expect to continue to conduct research  preclinical studies and process development activities on other product candidates 
it is likely that expenses related to these efforts will increase over time should these programs advance to later stages of development 
results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with the discussion above under liquidity and capital resources 
product sales net product sales are derived solely from entereg 
entereg was approved by the fda in may and product shipments to hospitals began in june in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we defer recognition of revenue associated with the first shipment of entereg to each hospital customer as we are not yet able to reasonably estimate future returns 
when an existing customer places a new order  we recognize product sales on the previous shipment for an amount equal to the lesser of a the previous shipment or b the new order 
hospital orders are processed through wholesalers  however  product is drop shipped from glaxo s warehouse directly to a registered hospital 
wholesalers remit payment to glaxo and  on a monthly basis  glaxo remits the net proceeds to us 
we record product sales net of prompt payment discounts  returns and other discounts as reported to us by glaxo 
while we undertake certain procedures to review the reasonableness of this information  we cannot obtain absolute assurance over the accounting methods and controls over such information utilized by glaxo 
net shipments of entereg through december  were million 
we recognized net product sales of million on shipments to the approximately hospitals that reordered entereg during the year ended december  we have a customer deposit balance of million at december  customer deposits represent net shipments made for which payment has been received from glaxo  but which have not yet been recognized as product sales revenue 
the remaining million difference represents product shipments for which payment has not yet been received from glaxo and for which the conditions of revenue recognition have not been met 
no product sales were recognized prior to contract revenues contract revenues are derived from our collaboration agreements with glaxo and pfizer and include milestones  amortization of up front license fees and cost reimbursement 
contract revenues were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily the result of a million milestone payment received from glaxo following fda approval of entereg for poi and an increase of million due to a full year of contract revenues under the pfizer collaboration 
in addition  glaxo contract revenues increased by million year over year as a result of increased expense reimbursement from glaxo 
the decrease in compared to 
table of contents was primarily the result of a million reduction in expense reimbursement from glaxo due to reduced expenses incurred by us relating to alvimopan programs  a reduction in co promotion revenues of million relating to the arixtra co promotion with glaxo  which was terminated in december  and a million reduction in the amortization of the up front license fee received from glaxo resulting from extending the estimated end of the performance period from april to april these decreases were partially offset by an increase in amortization of upfront fees and cost reimbursements associated with the pfizer collaboration of million in cost of product sales cost of product sales was million in the year ended december  and consisted primarily of royalty payments under certain alvimopan license agreements and fda fees 
prior to the fda approval of entereg for poi  costs associated with the manufacture of alvimopan were expensed to research and development 
since the unit product shipments in were less than the quantity of product manufactured prior to fda approval  no manufacturing costs were recorded in cost of product sales during the year ended december  research and development expenses our research and development expenses can be identified as internal or external expenses 
external expenses include expenses incurred with clinical research organizations  contract manufacturers and other third party vendors 
internal expenses include expenses such as personnel  laboratory and overhead expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and consist of the following year ended december  external research and development expenses entereg poi program delta agonist program obd program other programs total external research and development expenses total internal research and development expenses total research and development expenses we report all expenses gross within our statements of operations in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf  and  as such  the above table does not reflect any cost reimbursements from our collaboration partners 
total research and development expenses increased in as compared to due to the costs of phase a clinical studies in our delta agonist program and increased activity in our preclinical programs  partially offset by lower expenses in our obd program 
total research and development expenses decreased in as compared to due to a reduction in costs associated with our entereg program in poi  our obd development program and our other programs  partially offset by an increase in expenses related to our delta agonist program 
there are significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the preclinical and clinical studies associated with each of our research and development programs 
these studies may yield varying results that could delay  limit or prevent the advancement of a program through the various stages of product development and significantly impact the costs to be incurred  and time involved  in bringing a program to completion 
as a result  the cost to complete such programs  as well as the period in which net cash inflows from significant programs are expected to commence  are not reasonably estimable 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily driven by sales and marketing expenses associated with the launch of entereg 
the expense decrease in compared to was principally related to decreased personnel expenses  including expense associated with the elimination of our sales force in december  as well as lower marketing expenses 
interest income our interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreases year over year were due to lower average investment balances resulting from the use of cash in operating activities and an overall decline in interest rates during these periods 
other income  net other income  net was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and primarily represents cash received from the sale of certain pennsylvania research and development tax credits 
income taxes as of december   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards  which are potentially available to offset future taxable income 
the state net operating loss carryforwards began expiring during and the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in  if not utilized 
in addition  the utilization of the state net operating loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitation 
at december   we also had million of federal and million of state research and development tax credit carryforwards  which begin expiring in  and are available to reduce federal and state income taxes 
the tax reform act of the act provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we may have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of past financings 
additionally  because united states and certain state tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal and state income tax purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we develop and periodically change these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our financial statements for the year ended december  included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of 
table of contents their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sab  as amended by sab  eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  and eitf product sales  net entereg was approved by the fda in may and product shipments to hospitals began in june in accordance with sab  sab and sfas no 
 we defer recognition of revenue associated with the first shipment of entereg to each hospital customer as we are not yet able to reasonably estimate future returns 
when an existing customer places a new order  we recognize revenue on the previous shipment for an amount equal to the lesser of a the previous shipment or b the new order 
hospital orders are processed through wholesalers  however  entereg is drop shipped from glaxo s warehouse directly to a hospital registered under the entereg ease program 
this results in us being able to directly track actual hospital purchases 
once we have developed sufficient historical experience to estimate product returns  we intend to recognize net product sales upon the transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product to the customer 
we record product sales net of prompt payment discounts  returns and other discounts as reported to us by glaxo 
when payment from glaxo is received but the conditions for revenue recognition have not yet been met  we record a liability classified as customer deposits 
as of december   we had recorded million of customer deposits on our balance sheet related to payments received from glaxo for which the conditions of revenue recognition had not been met 
contract revenues contract revenues  which include revenues from collaborative agreements  consist primarily of amortization of up front fees  ongoing research and development funding and milestone and other payments under such agreements 
non refundable up front license fees are recognized as revenue if we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  can be separated in accordance with eitf we would recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations could not be determined  the up front license payment would be recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are to be performed 
we estimate our performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement and subsequently adjust the performance periods  if appropriate  based upon available facts and circumstances 
during the third quarter of  the performance period of the pfizer collaboration agreement was extended by six months to august based on the current status of the development programs 
the effect of this change in estimate was a decrease to contract revenues of million for the year ended december  our collaboration agreements also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met i the milestone payment is non refundable  ii achievement of the milestone 
table of contents involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  iii substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  iv the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and v a reasonable amount of time passes between the up front license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves the judgment of management 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and such payment would therefore be considered part of the consideration and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed in accordance with the policies described above 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf are met  the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria for contract revenues are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as long term deferred revenue 
the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as short term or long term is based upon management s estimate of its performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement 
these estimates may change in the future and such changes to estimates would be accounted for prospectively and would result in a change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
research and development expenses we have entered into contracts with third parties to conduct certain research and development activities including preclinical  clinical and manufacturing activities 
we accrue expenses related to such contracts based upon an estimate of the amounts due for work completed under the contracts 
factors considered in preparing such estimates include the number of subjects enrolled in studies and other criteria relating to the progress of efforts by our vendors 
valuation of equipment and leasehold improvements our equipment and leasehold improvements have been recorded at cost and are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
we periodically assess our equipment and leasehold improvements for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets  specifically equipment and leasehold improvements  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if indicators of impairment exist  impairment loss would be tested for if estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
the impairment charge  if any  is determined based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value  with fair value determined based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows or other appropriate measures of fair value 
since inception  we have not recorded any impairment charges 
equity based compensation beginning january   we have accounted for our employee stock option grants under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation in the statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires several inputs  one of which is volatility 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of stock options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
the 
table of contents expected life of our stock options represents the period of time that option awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns  which we believe are relevant indicators of future exercise patterns 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award using the straight line method 
for equity based awards with performance conditions  we recognize compensation cost if and when we conclude that it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
as a result of our stock options vesting on a monthly basis  we do not estimate a forfeiture rate 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such items are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax assets are reduced  as necessary  by a valuation allowance when management determines it is more likely than not that some or all of the tax benefits will not be realized 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that such tax rate changes are enacted 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures on fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years  however  the fasb did provide a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas no 
for certain non financial assets and liabilities 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
during the first quarter of see note of the financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
under sfas no 
 any unrealized holding gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
if elected  the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we did not elect to adopt the fair value option for eligible financial instruments under sfas no 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached in eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and recognized as an expense as goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf  which applies to collaborative arrangements that are conducted by the participants without the creation of a separate legal entity for the arrangements and clarifies  among other things  how to determine whether a collaborative agreement is within the scope of this issue 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment assets consist of us treasury obligations 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past held and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future to hold  such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated  or face  value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  totaled million  and the weighted average yield to maturity was approximately with maturities of investments ranging up to months
