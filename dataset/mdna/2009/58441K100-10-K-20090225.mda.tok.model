item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion addresses the principal factors affecting the company s financial condition and operations during the past three years and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the five year financial summary found in item and item of this report 
overview the company is a diversified communications company located primarily in the southeastern united states 
its mission is to be the leading provider of high quality news  information and entertainment in the southeast by continually building its position of strength in strategically located markets 
the company is committed to providing excellent local content in growth markets over multiple platforms  to continually developing new products and services that will stimulate audience and revenue growth  and to nurturing traditional audience viewership while cultivating the expanding role of online media 
the company implements its strategy and manages its operations through three business segments publishing  broadcast and interactive media 
the company owns daily newspapers and more than weekly newspapers and other targeted publications  network affiliated television stations excluding discontinued operations  and it operates web sites and portals that are associated with each of its newspapers and television stations as well as with many specialty publications 
it also has three growing interactive advertising services companies 
while the signs of a weakening economy were noticeable toward the end of and more pronounced throughout the following year  ushered in nearly unprecedented economic turmoil 
most companies  and particularly those in the media industry  were directly impacted by the adverse effects on consumer confidence and consequential lower advertiser spending levels 
the company s tampa operations which include the tampa tribune  wfla tv  and tbo 
com were the first and largest of the company s markets to be materially impacted  as a housing induced recession in florida which began in late served as an indicator of what was to follow throughout the country  unfortunately  many of the company s other markets are following similar paths 
the following chart illustrates the sharp drop in operating profits at the company s tampa operations in the later part of and throughout  culminating with a small operating loss by the close of unfavorable market conditions in the tampa bay region in and were amplified because they followed several years of booming growth in that area 
prior to  the tampa operations contributed meaningfully to the company s year over year rise in operating profits  however  beginning in late  they were responsible for a sizeable portion of the decline in divisional operating profits 
logo advertising sales from all three of the company s segments comprise the main source of its revenue 
the distribution of advertising revenues in the united states continues to shift among numerous established media  as well as many new entrants  resulting in increased competition 
the company recognizes the impending challenges facing its divisions  not only from internet competition  but also from structural changes in industries that have historically been major purchasers of print advertising  from a floundering economy punctuated by a sharp downturn in florida s economy  and from an upcoming odd numbered year which translates into the absence of political and olympic advertising for the broadcast division 
the company itself can do little to influence the weak economy or change the cyclical nature of odd numbered years  but it has made strategic plans to capitalize on the expansion of web based advertising 
while the pace and intensity of a shift away from traditional print advertising remains a concern  the internet and all of its potential presents tremendous opportunity 
maximizing this potential is a key strategy of all three of the company s divisions 
the interactive media  publishing and broadcast divisions have teamed together to create a web first approach to news reporting which provides an immediate platform for breaking news and positions the interactive media division for strong long term growth 
additionally  the company continues to focus on cultivating key partnership opportunities with established online presences such as yahoo  on creating ways to grow revenues through niche publications by expanding and building upon the success of its over weekly newspapers and targeted publications  and on facilitating the success of its interactive advertising services companies which represent a valuable and expanding source of revenues 
acquisitions and dispositions in  several plans were set in motion which allowed for a substantial reduction in debt in  a renewed focus on the company s core business as a pure media company  and a heightened focus on the evolving role of interactive media service companies 
in  the company purchased dealtaker 
com  an online social shopping portal that provides coupons and bargains to its users  and netinformer  a leading provider of mobile advertising and marketing services 
additionally  the company sold its one third ownership stake in sp newsprint company to white birch paper company 
that sale has substantially reduced the earnings volatility the company has experienced in recent years due to the highly cyclical nature of newsprint prices 
additionally  the company sold four tv stations and their associated web sites in three transactions in including wtvq in lexington  kentucky  wmbb in panama city  florida  kalb nalb in alexandria  louisiana  and wneg in toccoa 
the company has also entered into an agreement for the sale of wcwj in jacksonville  florida  which should be completed in the first half of primarily as a result of proceeds generated from these divestitures  long term debt was reduced by more than million in in  the company acquired four nbc owned and operated television stations and disposed of several cbs stations in markets which were not strategically aligned with the company s vision 
the stations acquired included wncn in raleigh  north carolina  wcmh in columbus  ohio  wvtm in birmingham  alabama  and wjar in providence  rhode island 
this acquisition expanded the company s southeastern footprint to include the key raleigh durham market 
the divested stations included kwch in wichita  kansas including that station s three satellites  wiat in birmingham  alabama as agreed upon when granted fcc approval for the purchase of wvtm in birmingham  wdef in chattanooga  tennessee  and kimt in mason city  iowa 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires that management make various estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses reported 
the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if that estimate requires assumptions be made about matters that were uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and if changes in the estimate which are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the audit committee of the board of directors has reviewed the development  selection and disclosure 
table of contents of these critical accounting estimates 
while actual results could differ from accounting estimates  the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas intangible assets the company reviews the carrying values of both goodwill and other identified intangible assets  including fcc licenses  in the fourth quarter each year  or earlier if events indicate impairment may have arisen  utilizing discounted cash flow models and market based models 
the preparation of the discounted cash flow models requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue growth  compensation levels  newsprint prices  discount rates and market trading multiples for broadcast and newspaper assets 
the preparation of the market based models requires the collection of estimated peer company data as to revenues and ebitda  as well as an assessment of enterprise values by looking at stock prices and debt levels 
these key assumptions for both the discounted cash flow and market based models work in concert with one another 
changes to one variable may necessitate changes to other variables 
challenging business conditions and the market s perception of the value of media company stocks prompted the company to perform an interim impairment test as of the end of the second quarter in that resulted in an impairment charge being recorded in that quarter 
the company performed its annual impairment test at the beginning of the fourth quarter of with no additional impairment indicated 
however  business conditions worsened during the fourth quarter  and the market s perception of the value of media company stocks deteriorated further resulting in both another interim impairment test and the recognition of additional impairment as of december  since the estimated fair values that arise in both the discounted cash flow and market based models are subject to change based on the company s performance and stock prices  peer company performance and stock prices  overall market conditions  and the state of the credit markets  future impairment charges are possible 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the determination of the liabilities and cost of the company s pension and other postretirement plans requires the use of assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions used in the company s pension and post retirement reporting are reviewed annually with independent actuaries and compared with external benchmarks  historical trends  and the company s own experience to determine that its assumptions are reasonable 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates expected return on plan assets salary growth mortality rates health care cost trends retirement rates expected contributions a one percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a change in pension expense for of approximately million 
a one percentage point change in the discount rate would have raised or lowered by more than million the plans expense and would have changed the plans projected obligations by approximately to million as of the end of effective for fiscal  the company redesigned its defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans and also added certain new employee benefit programs 
the changes included freezing the service accrual in the defined benefit retirement plan for existing employees while closing this plan to new employees  increasing the maximum company match in the k defined contribution plan to from of an employee s earnings this match has been suspended from april  through december   adding a profit sharing feature to the k plan  and establishing new retiree medical savings accounts 
the company took these steps to reduce the volatility of future pension expense and contributions while continuing to offer competitive retirement benefits to its employees 
self insurance liabilities the company self insures for certain medical and disability benefits  workers compensation costs  and automobile and general liability claims with specified stop loss provisions for high dollar claims 
the company estimates the liabilities for these items approximately million at december  based on historical experience and advice from actuaries and claim administrators 
actual claims experience as well as changes in health care cost trends could result in the company s eventual cost differing from the estimate 
income taxes the company files income tax returns with various state tax jurisdictions in addition to the internal revenue service and is regularly audited by both federal and state tax agencies 
from time to time  those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
the company has considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various tax agencies and does not anticipate any material impact on its earnings as a result of the various audits 
the company adopted interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 in the first quarter of this interpretation requires that income tax positions recognized in an entity s tax returns have a more likely than not chance of being sustained prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements 
if subsequent information becomes available that changes the more likely than not assessment of either a previously unrecognized or recognized tax benefit  the corresponding tax benefit or expense would be recorded in the period in which the information becomes available 
the company records income tax expense and liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the differing treatments of various items of income and expense for financial reporting versus tax reporting purposes 
under this standard  the company evaluates the need  if any  for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
the company ordinarily bases its estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates as well as expected future income 
however  the company was in a net deferred tax asset position at the end of and  although the company fully expects to utilize the underlying tax benefits  it could not assume future taxable income due to a cumulative book loss in recent years the direct result of non cash intangible asset impairment charges and therefore  established a valuation allowance 
significant changes in enacted federal and state tax laws or in expected future earnings might impact income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as the valuation allowance 
summary management believes  given current facts and circumstances  supplemented by the expertise and concurrence of external resources  including actuaries and accountants  that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable and are in accordance with gaap 
management further believes that the assumptions and estimates actually used in the financial statements  taken as a whole  represent the most appropriate choices from among reasonably possible alternatives and fairly present the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the company 
management will continue to discuss key estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
results of operations net income the company recorded a net loss of million in  and net income of million and million in and  respectively 
in order to facilitate a meaningful comparison of results for the last three years  several items merit separate consideration 
challenging business conditions and the market s perception of the value of media company stocks prompted the company to perform an interim impairment test as of the end of the second quarter in that resulted in an impairment charge being recorded in that quarter 
the company performed its annual impairment test at the beginning of the fourth quarter of with no additional impairment indicated 
however  
table of contents business conditions worsened during the fourth quarter  and the market s perception of the value of media company stocks deteriorated further  resulting in an additional impairment at the end of as a result of this testing  in the company recorded aggregate impairment charges related to goodwill in the publishing division of million  fcc licenses in the broadcast division of million  network affiliation agreements in the broadcast division of million  trade names and other intangible assets in the broadcast division of million  and certain investments and real estate of million  resulting in after tax non cash impairment charges totaling million 
for a more complete discussion regarding these impairment charges  see note of item of this form k 
as indicated earlier  the company completed the sale of four television stations in and recorded after tax losses of million in and million in related to these divestitures 
additionally  the company sold several cbs stations in resulting in an after tax gain of million 
the results of the sold stations and their associated web sites and wcwj which is expected to be sold in the first half of have been reported as discontinued operations for all years presented 
the remainder of this discussion focuses only on results from continuing operations 
for comparative purposes  results of the four nbc stations acquired in the third quarter of have been excluded in discussions comparing to see note of item of this form k for a detailed discussion of the company s acquisitions and divestitures 
the company also consummated the sale of sp newsprint spnc in the second quarter of and increased the year end pretax sale related costs and write downs it originally recorded in of approximately million by another million in based on the estimated value of certain post closing items 
in addition to these losses  the company s share of spnc s underlying operating results was a loss of million in compared to income of in the decline in was due to the impact of lower newsprint prices and higher raw material costs in that year 
see note of item of this form k for a more complete discussion of the spnc sale 
in an effort to better align its costs with the current business environment  the company implemented a cost reduction plan which included voluntary and non voluntary separation programs 
these workforce reductions were in response to a general economic downturn and  particularly  to the deep housing induced recession in the florida market 
it resulted in pretax severance costs of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
further  the company recorded a million pretax gain on an insurance settlement related to a fire at the company s richmond times dispatch printing facility that occurred in the second quarter of  an additional million pretax gain was recorded in as the company identified a more cost effective method to clean the equipment and remediate the facility than previously anticipated 
the company also recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance that is discussed later in this md a 
additionally  fiscal included an extra rd week  which contributed approximately million in revenues and million to net income and  accordingly  influenced virtually all comparisons of and results 
the following chart reflects adjustments for the aforementioned items on an after tax basis years ended in thousands net income loss adjusted for net of taxes goodwill and other asset impairment net gain loss related to divestiture of operations severance and costs related to consolidation of printing facilities income loss on sp newsprint income from discontinued operations gain on insurance recovery defered tax valuation allowance approximate impact of rd week adjusted income in  the company s adjusted income of million as shown in the previous chart  reflected a decline from prior year adjusted income of million 
the largest factor impacting these results was an million decrease in publishing division revenues which  despite strong reductions in operating expense excluding severance and costs related to consolidation of printing facilities  resulted in a drop in publishing operating profits 
partially offsetting the downturn in year over year divisional results were a decrease in interest expense in the current year due to lower interest rates and decreased average debt levels  a million increase in gains on fixed asset sales  a million reduction in intangibles amortization expense due primarily to the write down of network affiliation assets resulting from the mid year impairment charge  and lower costs for performance based incentives 
adjusted income in fell million from two factors contributed almost equally to the year over year downturn 
first  broadcast division operating profits including the nbc stations acquired in the third quarter of declined nearly million reflecting substantially reduced political advertising in the odd numbered year 
second  publishing division operating profits fell more than million as all major advertising categories were down from the prior year due in large part to the pronounced economic downturn in florida s economy 
also impacting the first half of was higher interest expense as a result of increased debt levels associated with the acquisition of the nbc stations acquired in the third quarter of publishing operating income for the publishing division decreased million in from the prior year in spite of a million reduction in operating expense  which substantially assuaged an million drop in revenues 
in  operating income decreased million from despite cost containment measures which appreciably mitigated a million decline in revenues including approximately million of revenues associated with the extra week in 
the division s tampa operations were responsible for more than half of the overall revenue decrease in and for approximately two thirds of the decline as the company s largest market remains in a 
table of contents pronounced recession 
accordingly  all advertising revenue categories shown in the following chart were detrimentally impacted by that market s hardship 
classified advertising suffered the largest portion of the revenue decline as employment  automotive and real estate advertising decreased in virtually all markets  but particularly in the tampa market  where classified fell in and in from the prior years 
retail revenues were down due to lower general advertising levels in reaction to the stunted economy  categories which struggled the most over the past three years included the department store  home improvement and home furnishing 
national revenues fell primarily due to weak spending levels in the automotive  telecommunications and pharmaceutical categories 
logo the division has reacted to the challenging advertising environment by reducing costs across all markets while achieving greater efficiencies and by implementing aggressive actions to better align expenses with current economic reality 
this included a workforce reduction which resulted in an approximate decrease in publishing personnel from the beginning of to the end of the division s results included pretax charges of approximately million  million and 
million in   and  respectively  which were comprised of severance costs and expenses associated with the consolidation of certain printing facilities 
excluding the aforementioned severance costs  publishing division operating expense decreased a substantial from due largely to lower compensation and benefit costs 
compensation and benefit expense declined nearly due to the combination of several factors  including the elimination of positions at nearly all newspapers  lower commissions  and the absence of profit sharing expense in despite higher average newsprint prices per short ton  up to per ton  newsprint costs were down million in due to reduced consumption as a result of newspaper redesigns  lower advertising linage  decreased circulation volumes  and concerted conservation efforts 
in addition to the areas of expense reduction already discussed  the company s tampa operations further reduced departmental costs by approximately million due to savings in the areas of circulation sales  promotion and repairs and maintenance 
excluding severance costs  publishing division operating expenses decreased million in which included approximately million of additional expense as a result of the extra week in 
newsprint costs were down million due to reduced consumption as a result of switching to lighter weight newsprint  concerted conservation efforts and decreased advertising and circulation volumes  as well as to lower average newsprint prices which were down per short ton 
a decrease in employee benefits and compensation costs also contributed to the overall expense reduction  due in large part to lower retirement and healthcare costs and a decrease in advertising commissions 
broadcast broadcast results for all of and the second half of included the four nbc stations which the company acquired at the beginning of the third quarter of as mentioned earlier  for purposes of comparisons to and for the charts that follow  results of these nbc stations and all discontinued operations are excluded 
in  broadcast operating income was down million compared to due to a million drop in revenues  offset by a million decrease in operating expense including a million year over year increase in severance costs 
this revenue decline was atypical for a year that included political and olympic advertising  and illustrated just how difficult the advertising climate was 
advertising time sales at the broadcast division are typically elevated in even numbered years as a result of the olympics and national and statewide political races which generate additional advertising dollars 
these events  or their absence in a given year  cause a certain cyclicality in the company s broadcast revenues which is demonstrated in the following graph that shows political advertising as a percentage of total time sales 
logo accordingly  and yielded predictably higher political advertising revenues  which were in sharp contrast to despite summer olympic revenues in excess of million and robust political advertising in  broadcast revenues declined as national and local time sales experienced soft advertiser spending across several markets as well as in a number of key categories 
national revenues fell due in large part to anemic automotive advertising  combined with weak advertising levels in the corporate and telecommunications categories 
local time sales were down in from the prior year on reduced spending in the automotive and home furnishing categories 
conversely  political time sales in exceeded five and one half times the prior year level due to strong spending associated with the presidential campaigns  us congressional races  and issue spending in certain states 
the following chart illustrates comparative advertising time sales by categories over the past three years 
logo the division has responded to the difficult advertising environment by implementing aggressive actions to better align expenses with the current economic circumstances 
this included a workforce reduction which resulted in a decrease of more than in broadcast personnel from the beginning of to the end of the division s results included pretax severance charges of approximately million  
million and 
million in   and  respectively 

table of contents excluding the aforementioned severance costs  the broadcast division s operating expenses decreased just over million in from a reduction in employee compensation and benefit costs from the prior year was the primary catalyst  the result of certain positions being held open or eliminated and the absence of profit sharing expense in additionally  the division remained vigilant in its efforts to control discretionary spending  achieving savings in areas such as sales incentives  travel and employee relocation 
broadcast operating income decreased million in from primarily due to a million decrease in revenues including approximately million relating to the extra week in 
a predictable  but nonetheless large  decline in political advertising accounted for the majority of the division s lower revenues 
national advertising revenues demonstrated solid growth in over primarily on the strength of the telecommunications category 
in  local time sales were slightly below the level due to restrained automotive spending as dealers remained cautious  but this category began to regain a foothold by the close of the year on strong grocery store advertising 
there was no surprise surrounding the more than decline in political time sales in  political revenues generated from presidential primaries  gubernatorial races and issue advertising curbed what could have been an even larger descent from the prior year 
broadcast operating expense rose million in compared to the prior year including million of additional expense from s rd week due to higher compensation expense and depreciation costs 
despite having an extra week in  depreciation costs increased on new digital equipment in as the division had virtually completed its government mandated conversion to broadcast high definition television by the end of the year 
employee compensation costs increased more than due to higher sales commissions as the division worked to replace political revenues through sales development initiatives 
lower healthcare and retirement related costs helped to constrain the increase in overall employee compensation and benefits costs to less than 
interactive media the primary components comprising the interactive media division imd are the website group the web sites associated with newspapers and television stations  the advertising services group includes blockdot  dealtaker and netinformer  and interactive investments 
net write downs of interactive investments totaled million in and 
million in and have been excluded for purposes of the divisional discussion that follows 
in the first half of  the company acquired dealtaker 
com  an online social shopping portal that provides coupons and bargains to its users 
dealtaker 
com generated revenues of million in and produced stellar operating profits of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company purchased netinfomer  a leading provider of mobile advertising and marketing services  and richmond 
com  a local news and entertainment portal 
in the third quarter of  the company purchased four nbc television stations which included their associated web sites 
for purposes of the remainder of this discussion and for the charts that follow  discontinued operations  investments and results of dealtaker 
com are excluded  for purposes of comparisons to  results from the acquired nbc web sites are also excluded 
imd s operating loss increased million in from due to the combination of a million decrease in revenues and a million increase in operating expenses 
revenues declined in from the prior year predominantly due to lower sales at blockdot  as the pace of advergaming sales reflected the sluggish economy 
revenues at the website group dropped less than as strong growth in local advertising was unable to offset lower national and classified revenues 
online classified advertising  where customers pay an additional fee to have their classified advertisement placed online simultaneously with its publication in the newspaper  has historically been the backbone of the division and  prior to  had consistently produced strong revenue growth 
however  imd s online classified advertising is directly impacted by classified performance in the publishing division and has suffered comparably  particularly because of florida s struggling economy 
the downward slide in online classified advertising was the result of lower volumes of print advertising  partially offset by rate increases 
the decline in classified results would have been more severe had it not been for the company s relationship with yahoo hotjobs which allowed for higher rates due to the increase in volume brought about by that relationship 
national revenues fell in from the prior year due in large part to the general economic decline which was particularly pronounced at the florida group 
local online advertising generated a robust increase in over as banner advertising and sponsorships showed solid growth 
the following chart illustrates differing trends among imd s advertising revenue categories 
after years of proliferation  national revenues began to slide slightly below the level by the close of as the current economic environment took its toll 
online classified advertising still the largest source of divisional revenue continued to suffer from print volume declines at the publishing division  while local revenues showed solid year over year growth 
logo imd s operating expenses were up million in  predominantly the result of increased employee compensation and benefit expense due to additional staffing in key areas 
the infrastructure that was built initially in to support the division s growth initiatives remained in place this year and contributed to these higher costs 
in  absent the previously mentioned net investment write down  the division generated robust double digit revenue growth up from and reduced its operating loss by from the prior year as revenue growth outpaced higher expenses 
embedded within these results was an additional 
million in revenues attributable to the extra rd week in  which also spawned an additional 
million in operating losses as the result of higher expenses 
blockdot was an instrumental factor in the division s success as a shift from blockdot s operating loss of million in to producing an operating profit of million in contributed significantly 
imd revenues increased million with two thirds of that growth coming from blockdot  where advergaming revenues tripled 
the remaining divisional revenue growth was generated by a increase in local online advertising as banners and sponsorships showed solid growth  combined with national regional online revenues that more than doubled as strengthening relationships with an expanding network of national agencies translated into more advertisers 
advertising revenues rose in all categories with the exception of classified advertising which declined in from the prior year 
initial revenues from the company s strategic alliance with yahoo hotjobs helped mitigate the overall decline in online classified advertising 
imd s operating expense increased million in compared to primarily reflecting higher employee compensation and benefits expense due to additional staffing  increased commissions  and annual salary increases due to a focus on recruiting  as well as retaining  talented sales personnel 
the division also incurred expenses related to its yahoo hotjobs agreement that were not present a year ago 
the interactive media division remains focused on positioning itself for strong long term growth by increasing visitor and page view 
table of contents growth  creating a dynamic online presence across all the company s web sites  and generating revenue growth with a focus on expanded product offerings and attracting new customers 
the web first approach to news reporting provides an immediate platform for breaking news and helps stimulate audience growth  as evidenced by an increase in pages views at the division s website group in over the prior year 
the following chart illustrates a steady rise in both page views and visits at the website group over the past three years 
logo interest expense interest expense decreased million in from the prior year due almost equally to a decrease in the company s average effective borrowing rate of basis points to and to an approximate million decline in average debt levels  primarily the result of the application of proceeds from the sales of sp newsprint and four television stations to debt reduction during in the third quarter of  the company entered into three interest rate swaps where it pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate to manage interest cost and cash flows associated with variable interest rates  primarily short term changes in libor  not to trade such instruments for profit or loss 
the interest rate swaps are carried at fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis predicated on quoted libor prices of the estimated amounts the company would have received or paid to terminate the swaps 
these interest rate swaps are cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling million  swaps with notional amounts of million will mature in  and million will mature in changes in cash flows of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the interest payments on the company s million bank term loan 
these swaps effectively convert the company s variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt with a weighted average interest rate approximating at december  income taxes the company s effective tax rate on income loss from continuing operations was on a pretax loss  on pretax income  including a one time tax benefit discussed below and on pretax income in  and  respectively 
the increase in the rate was due primarily to the absence of the state tax benefit recognized in the sharp reduction in the rate was due to the relatively greater impact that favorable permanent differences book versus tax had on the current year s reduced pretax income and to a tax benefit of thousand that the company recognized in the third quarter of to record the favorable resolution of an outstanding state income tax assessment 
as of december   the company established a valuation allowance against its entire net deferred tax asset of million because cumulative pretax income in recent years was in an overall loss position primarily due to the current year impairment charges 
there was no valuation allowance as of december  a portion of the valuation allowance million affected the consolidated statement of operations and was reflected in the company s effective tax rate of  the remainder affected comprehensive income items 
see note of item of this form k for a complete discussion of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
at the beginning of fiscal the company recognized a million net increase in the liability for uncertain tax positions  which was accounted for as a reduction of retained earnings  as of january  see note of item of this form k for a complete discussion of the adoption of this standard and the roll forward of the liability of uncertain tax positions 
other the company has certain plans in place  mainly the supplemental k plan and the director s deferred compensation plan  which are designed to align the interests of the participants with those of the shareholders 
future fluctuations in the company s stock price could have a significant effect on the amount of expense recognized 
each change in the company s stock price as of december  would have affected the company s pretax income by approximately 
million 
liquidity the country has been faced with both an economic crisis  the effect of which on the company s operating results has been discussed earlier  and a credit crisis  which has also impacted the company 
however  the steps that the company has taken to lower its debt levels and renegotiate its bank agreements  plus other available operating measures  should allow the company the flexibility necessary to operate within the debt covenants at a cost that is manageable 
entering  the company had in place a billion revolving credit facility million outstanding  million in senior notes  million in debt that existed as the result of consolidating certain variable interest entities in which the company had controlling financial interest by virtue of certain real property leases  and million in bank lines 
the company was subject to both interest coverage and leverage ratio covenants 
this debt structure not only served the company s operating needs but allowed the company to make significant strategic acquisitions like the purchase of four nbc stations in mid when total debt outstanding reached a peak of billion 
subsequent to that acquisition  the company announced a plan to lower its debt through a combination of television station sales and by using operating cash flow to repay debt 
by the end of  the company had replaced the million of senior notes with a million bank term loan and completed the sales of certain television stations with gross proceeds of million 
however  its operating performance  particularly in its largest market in tampa  began to weaken late in the year 
the company repaid million of the outstanding debt in the later half of even with capital spending of million mostly related to the government mandated conversion to digital television and replacement of certain newspaper production facilities 
as the wider economy deteriorated in  the weakness in tampa deepened and the company s other markets were affected to a greater degree 
even as the company was taking steps on the operating side to reduce its expenses  it reassessed its portfolio of assets and initiated the process to sell its interest in sp newsprint and certain other television stations 
during that year it also repaid the million of variable interest debt by using existing capacity under its revolving credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of  the company amended certain provisions of its debt agreements to increase the maximum leverage ratio covenant and reduce the minimum interest ratio covenant for a period of three fiscal quarters 
the company s covenants have historically involved and continue to involve debt levels  interest expense  and a rolling four quarter calculation of ebitda a measure of cash earnings as defined in the revolving credit agreement and thus a decline in operating performance adversely affects these ratios 
despite these difficult economic times and capital expenditures that totaled million  the company repaid million of debt in unfortunately  both the wider economy and the company s markets worsened in the company took additional steps on the operating 
table of contents side to reduce costs 
during the year  it also completed the sale of sp newprint and four television stations the company has entered into an agreement for the sale of a fifth station  wcwj  which should be completed in the first half of yielding aggregate proceeds of million 
the company also reduced its capital spending to million as expenditures for digital television and newspaper production facility replacement was largely completed  and in the fourth quarter it cut its dividend approximately in half 
the company made acquisitions totaling million in  primarily targeting online and interactive media companies reflecting the strategic direction in which the company is headed 
the company repaid debt of million during the company also amended its credit agreements just before the end of at the end of  the company s debt consisted of a modified revolving credit facility of million million outstanding at year end  the term loan of million  and million outstanding under bank lines 
these facilities mature in pursuant to the amendments  the maximum leverage ratio covenants were increased for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  they will subsequently be reduced slightly for the remainder of and for the first three quarters of  and will remain at a constant level thereafter 
the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant was also reduced through the first quarter of and will be increased slightly for the remaining term of the facilities 
the borrowing capacity on the modified revolving credit facility was reduced from billion to million  and interest rate margins on both facilities were increased 
additional annual borrowing capacity reductions will be made based on the company s excess cash flow  as defined 
if the leverage ratio were to exceed certain levels  the amended agreements also contain restrictions on dividends  capital spending  indebtedness  capital leases  and investments 
the company pledged its cash and assets and the capital stock of its subsidiaries as collateral 
since mid  the company has repaid million of debt 
it has also taken actions to be fully compliant with its covenants  and it continues to take prudent actions to ensure it will be in compliance with its covenants going forward 
in january  the company announced the suspension of dividends to shareholders 
additionally  in order to continue to address operating costs for  the company has suspended the k match for the last nine months of the year and does not anticipate paying profit sharing or management bonuses neither of which were paid in 
capital spending will be limited as well 
the company s current operating plan contemplates further debt reduction in given the economic climate facing the country  there is uncertainty about the company s operating results in the short term but the company is closely monitoring operating results and their effect on debt covenants

purchase obligations include all current liabilities not otherwise reported in the table that will require cash settlement  significant purchase commitments for fixed assets  and significant non ordinary course contract based obligations
