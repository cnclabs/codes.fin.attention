crimson aerials engineers and manufactures aerial ladder components for fire trucks 
the company s business strategy is to further diversify product lines and develop innovative design  engineering and manufacturing expertise in order to be the best value producer of custom vehicle products in the north american marketplace 
spartan chassis sells its custom diesel chassis to three principal markets fire truck  motorhome and specialty vehicles 
spartan chassis believes that opportunities for growth remain strong for custom built chassis and vehicles in each market 
the company has an innovative team focused on building lasting relationships with its customers 
this is accomplished by striving to deliver premium custom vehicles and services that inspire customer loyalty 
the company believes that it can best carry out its long term business plan and obtain optimal financial flexibility by using a combination of borrowings under the company s credit facilities  as well as equity capital  as sources of expansion capital 
a key metric in measuring the company s success is the company s return on invested capital roic 
the company defines roic as operating income  less taxes  on an annualized basis  divided by total shareholders equity 
the company expects future growth and earnings to come from the growing strength of the spartan brands  including spartan chassis  crimson fire and road rescue 
evteam operational improvements as processes are reengineered to lower costs by eliminating non value added activities 
recent additions to manufacturing capacity for fire truck chassis cabs  specialty vehicles  and motorhomes chassis  expanded our capability to fulfill current and future market needs 
in  the company unveiled the furion which is the entry level fire truck cab and chassis in the spartan chassis product line 
the furion is designed to bridge the market between custom and commercial vehicles 
opportunities in the areas of specialty vehicles  service parts and micro niche markets 
the company has received subcontract orders and continues to receive service part orders for units produced under the mine resistant ambush protected mrap program  the iraqi light armored vehicle ilav program  the joint ied defeat organization jieddo program  the yemen light armored vehicle ylav program and the special operations command socom program 
the company is working closely with military customers to develop new lines of mine resistant vehicles  such as the multipurpose all terrain vehicle matv for deployment in afghanistan and other variants for the us and other militaries 
opportunities for increased service  parts and accessory sales as the number of military vehicles containing the company s components in the field grow 
potential for increased sales from the evteam due to increased demand from changes to industry safety regulations and engine emissions change and the introduction of new products  such as the frac 
the frac  an acronym for first response all calls  can best be described as a low cost  multi function vehicle  with both patient transport and fire truck pumping capabilities 
the company believes the major strength of its business model is market diversity and customization  with a growing foundation in emergency rescue 
the emergency rescue market is relatively less affected by geo political events compared to the recreational vehicle market and the military market 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere within this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of the company s consolidated statements of income  on an actual basis  as a percentage of revenues year ended december  of sales spartan chassis evteam consol idated spartan chassis evteam consol idated spartan chassis evteam consol idated sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment operating income other income expense  net earnings before taxes on income taxes on income net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated sales increased million to million  from million for the same period in the increase was due to a million increase in spartan chassis sales coupled with a million increase in evteam sales 
intercompany sales from spartan chassis to the evteam increased million over the prior year 
intercompany sales are eliminated from the consolidated sales totals 
other sales at spartan chassis drove the majority of its sales increase  with a million increase over the prior year s period 
also contributing to the increase in consolidated sales was an increase in fire truck chassis sales of million 
these increases were partially offset by the decline in motorhome chassis sales of million 
the increase in other sales at spartan chassis was primarily due to an increase of specialty chassis of million paired with an increase in service part sales of million 
the growth in specialty chassis is due to increases in military chassis volume primarily as a result of orders received under the mine resistant ambush protected mrap program 
production under this program began in the third quarter of and the backlog of orders received as of december  continued production through most of as the mrap program is winding down  no major future orders are expected under this particular program that will materially impact results 
however  additional military orders under different programs  such as the m atv program for deployment in afghanistan and other variants for the us and other militaries  if received  could impact operations and results 
additionally  other sales were affected by the increase in volume of service part sales 
these sales correspond to increased military vehicles in the field  primarily as a result of the mrap program mentioned above 
service parts and accessory volumes are expected to be strong in primarily in support of military units in the field 
see item a risk factors relating to government contracts for more details 
the decrease in motorhome chassis sales was due to lower order volume  as a result of weakened economic conditions impacting the motorhome market as a whole 
the year over year backlog of motorhome orders decreased as of december  accordingly production levels of motorhome chassis are expected to be down year over year 
the majority of the sales increase for the evteam is a result of increases at road rescue of million and increases at crimson fire aerials of million  partially offset by a sales decrease at crimson fire of million 
higher ambulance sales at road rescue  which were up over the prior year  are largely due to higher order intake at the end of higher volume of units sold year over year of aerial fire trucks contributed to the increase in sales for crimson fire aerials 
these increases were offset by lower fire truck sales  down approximately year over year due primarily to decreased sales volumes as result of lower orders received during the year 
backlog for the evteam  at december   is up million compared to december  and will positively impact production levels and sales in increased backlog at the end of is in part due to the changes in industry safety regulations and the engine emissions change 
gross margin as a percent of sales increased to for the twelve months ended december  from for the same time period in the increase is due primarily to sales mix mainly as a result of higher service parts sales in the period  which provide a higher gross margin 
in addition  the company was able to leverage fixed overhead costs to increased sales volumes  which resulted in higher margins 
the evteam also contributed to the increase in margins resulting from price increases for ambulances  approximately per unit  and improved production efficiencies for fire trucks  approximately per unit 
the impact of these price increases and production efficiencies are expected to continue into operating expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for the twelve month period ended december  compared to for the same period of this is primarily a result of one time charges  primarily legal expenses and fines and penalties 
the fines and penalties of million related to the reported settlement between spartan chassis and the department of justice 
see item legal proceedings of this form k for more details 
operating expense dollars increased million due to the fines and penalties noted above in addition to higher compensation expense for incentive plans 
the higher compensation expense for incentive plans is a result of the improved results year over year combined with greater wages and benefits related to higher staffing levels to support the sales increase 
the increase in the company s income taxes from million in to million in is primarily due to increased earnings before taxes in when compared to the effective tax rate was in as compared to in the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the increase in non deductible charges primarily related to fines and penalties related to the legal settlement 
see note  taxes on income  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 
net earnings increased by million per diluted share to million per diluted share in from million per diluted share in as a result of the factors discussed above 
total chassis orders received during decreased compared to the same period in this reflects decreases in motorhome chassis orders that were down due to the poor economic conditions 
specialty chassis orders were also down as military orders in were less than those placed in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in fire truck orders in advance of the changes in certain industry regulations effective for january the evteam experienced an increase of during over of orders received also due to the changes in industry regulations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated sales increased million over sales for the same period in the increase was due to a million increase in spartan chassis sales coupled with a million increase in evteam sales 
intercompany sales from spartan chassis to the evteam decreased million over the prior year 
intercompany sales are eliminated from the consolidated sales totals 
within spartan chassis  the motorhome chassis line experienced a sales increase of million over sales 
this increase was due to higher unit sales due to additional models being offered by existing customers 
fire truck chassis  another major product line for spartan chassis  experienced an increase of million in sales for the year ended december  over the year ended december  fire truck units sold were flat in compared to  however the company s average selling price per fire truck grew as the market continues to demand more complex product options 
other spartan chassis sales were million compared to million in  an increase of million 
this growth over the prior year is primarily due to higher sales of military chassis coupled with higher service part sales 
sales of military chassis increased million over the military chassis sales levels in the prior year 
this increase was due to an increase in military chassis volume  primarily as a result of orders received under the new mine resistant ambush protected mrap program 
production under this program began in the third quarter of and the backlog of orders received as of december  continued production into the increase in evteam sales for was a result of increases at crimson fire of million and at road rescue of million  while crimson fire aerials remained fairly flat with a million increase in sales 
the crimson fire sales increase was driven by higher average unit prices 
road rescue experienced improved sales due to an increase in the number of units sold as well as a higher average unit sell price 
gross profit increased from million in to million in due to higher sales volumes 
however  gross margin decreased from in to in  due primarily to a change in the product sales mix 
in the prior year  the specialty chassis in production were a part of lower volume military programs while the primary specialty chassis product in production in is part of the mrap program 
the mrap program is a highly competitive program with many oem s bidding to secure orders resulting in lower margins for these specialty chassis 
operating expenses increased by million from levels 
the main factors in the increase were staff additions and overtime paid to support the increase in sales discussed above 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in the company s income taxes from million in to million in is primarily due to increased earnings before taxes in when compared to the effective tax rate was in as compared to in the reason for the decrease in the effective tax rate was twofold 
the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by a non deductible goodwill charge 
additionally  experienced an increase in the section production deduction 
see note  taxes on income  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 
net earnings increased million per diluted share  post split from million per diluted share  post split in to million per diluted share  post split in as a result of the factors discussed above 
fourth quarter results the company s rate of sales growth has varied historically from quarter to quarter 
for a description of quarterly financial data  see note  quarterly financial data unaudited  of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in this form k 
sales during the fourth quarter were less than the prior quarters in due to the higher specialty chassis sales in the first three quarters of  primarily as a result of military orders that were completed early in the fourth quarter 
additionally  motorhome sales were down compared to prior quarters in this same year  due to the continued stress in the economic market 
these decreases in sales were partially offset by an increase in the service part sales due to increased support of the military units in the field 
the fire truck chassis and evteam sales remained fairly consistent over the quarters of gross profit was disproportionate in the fourth quarter of compared to the previous quarters primarily due to sales mix 
there were higher service parts sales in the period  which provide a higher gross margin 
the evteam also contributed to increased margins in the quarter resulting from price increases and improved production efficiencies  as detailed in the year over year analysis 
net earnings during the fourth quarter were negatively impacted by the penalties and fines  related to the settlement with the department of justice  in addition to the same variables noted above affecting sales and gross profit 
see item legal proceedings of this form k for more details on the settlement 
sales during the fourth quarter of were higher than the prior quarters of  driven by an increase in other sales 
the primary factors for the increase in other sales are consistent with the explanation for the year over year increase detailed above 
higher military chassis and service part sales drove this increase as a result of higher order volumes 
gross profit and net earnings for the quarter ended december  were greater than the prior quarters of  primarily due to the impact of the mrap program ramp up 
sales increased in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of  while gross profit increased over the same time period 
as production under the mrap program began in the third quarter of  material and labor efficiencies were improved in the fourth quarter of this occurred as the company s workforce became more familiar with the production of the product 
the reason net income grew more dramatically over the quarter compared to sales growth was twofold 
first  staff was added in the third quarter of ahead of the correlated sales increase to support the ramp up of the mrap program 
second  overhead operating costs do not increase at the same level sales increase  as most base operating expenses are already in place  such as research and development and selling  general and adminis trative staff 
financial condition balance sheet at december  compared to december  accounts receivable decreased approximately million and inventories decreased million at december  when compared to december  these decreases were primarily a result of the completed orders under the mrap and mrap plus programs as reflected in the decreased sales in the fourth quarter of noted above 
sales in the fourth quarter of were lower than those in the fourth quarter of due to a decrease in motorhome sales of million and a decrease in other product sales of million 
motorhome sales were down due to the economic climate 
other product sales decreased as sales under the mrap program in had completed in  with only a slight sales offset in the fourth quarter of related to the mrap plus program 
these decreased sales directly resulted in the decrease in accounts receivable at december  deposits on engines were million at december  while there was not a balance at december  these deposits support the surge in fire truck chassis and evteam sales orders received in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter of  and for the additional projected orders expected to be received in property  plant and equipment net of accumulated depreciation increased approximately million from million at december  the increase is due to the construction of a new office building  which was put into service during the third quarter of  and renovations to manufacturing and office facilities which continued into the fourth quarter 
accounts payable at december  decreased million compared to december  the decrease is primarily a result of decreased inventory purchases 
higher purchases were made in the fourth quarter of to support the ramp up of production of specialty chassis under the mrap program 
in the fourth quarter of  the inventory purchases would have been paid off prior to december in keeping with the purchase terms and contributing to the decrease in accounts payable year over year 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated an roic of in the fourth quarter of compared to for the same period in the company defines return on invested capital as operating income  less taxes  on an annualized basis  divided by total shareholders equity 
roic for the year ended december was  a increase as compared to roic of in for the year ended december   cash generated by operating activities was million  which was a million increase from the million of cash used in operating activities in the million difference in cash generated from operating activities year over year was primarily due to changes in the components of working capital  accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
the year over year change in cash generated from these drivers was million 
additional increases in sources of cash year over year came from the increase in net earnings of million and deposits from customers of million 
these sources of cash were partially offset by a million use of cash in other assets 
this use was for deposits on engines for planned production in see the financial condition section in item of this form k for further discussion regarding the accounts receivable  inventory  deposit on engines and accounts payable balances at december  com pared to december  see the consolidated statements of cash flows contained in item of this form k for the other various factors that represented the remaining fluctuation of cash from operations of million between the periods 
the cash from operations allowed for the pay down of long term debt by million  the purchase of property  plant and equipment of million  and the payment of dividends of million during the purchases of property  plant and equipment during the of million were million lower than the million of purchases during the same period in during  facilities were added to support the ramp up of production of vehicles under the mrap program and to support the increased level of military service parts sales 
continued investments were made in  including the completion of a new office building  but not at the level that the initial mrap production ramp up required in in  the company expects to incur capital expenditures in the range of million to million for new strategic initiatives and needed improvements or replacement of existing property  plant and equipment for operations 
shareholders equity increased million  from million as of december  to million as of december  the increase was driven by million in net income of the company  coupled with million from compensation related to restricted stock 
these were partially offset by million paid out in dividends and million for the issuance of common stock and the tax benefit of stock incentive plan transactions 
on july   the board of directors authorized management to repurchase  over the course of the subsequent month period  up to a total of  shares of its common stock in open market transactions 
the program expired july  the company had repurchased  shares under that program as previously disclosed 
on july   the board of directors reauthorized management to repurchase  over the course of the subsequent month period  up to a total of  shares of its common stock in open market transactions 
repurchase of common stock is contingent upon market conditions 
as of december   no shares of common stock were repurchased under the new authorization 
if the company were to repurchase the full  shares of stock under the repurchase program  they would cost the company approximately  million based on the closing price of the company s stock on february  the company believes that it has sufficient resources to fund this potential s tock buyback 
in october  the board of directors approved a restructuring of its revolving note payable with jp morgan chase bank 
the company renegotiated the line to obtain a locked interest rate of basis points over libor for draws and a basis point commitment fee on the unused portion of the line 
the interest rates will be in effect until the line matures in september this restructuring included a decrease in the total line of credit available to million by december  as of december   the company had no borrowings under this debt agreement in the form of a line of credit 
the line of credit includes three one year automatic extensions unless the bank provides notice of non renewal months in advance of the expiration date 
the company also had a million unsecured term note  which carried an interest rate of as of december   under the same debt agreement and terminates effective november  under the terms of the line of credit and term note agreement  the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios and other financial conditions 
the agreement also prohibits the company from incurring additional indebtedness  limits certain acquisitions  investments  advances or loans and restricts substantial asset sales 
at december   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
the company has a private shelf agreement with prudential investment management  inc this agreement allows the company to borrow up to million to be issued in million minimum increments 
the interest rate is determined based on applicable rates at time of issuance 
the company had a million unsecured term note issued under this shelf agreement as of december   which carried an interest rate of 
the company has an unsecured fixed rate long term note which bears interest at 
the loan is repayable in equal monthly installments and matures in october at december   the total outstanding amount on this note was million of which  is payable in the company has a secured line of credit for million  which has an expiration date of july  there were no borrowings under this line at december  the company has two secured mortgage notes of which million and million were outstanding as of december  the mortgage notes carry a fixed interest rate of payable in monthly installments for principal and interest of  and  respectively  with balances due july  and march   respectively 
these mortgage notes are secured by real estate and buildings 
on february   the board of directors approved a special dividend of per common share to shareholders of record on april  in recognition of the financial performance 
additionally  in recognition of the company s financial strength and future prospects  the board of directors has continued to approve the payment of regular dividends to its shareholders 
at this same meeting  regular dividends of per share payable in the amount of per share on may  and per share on december  to shareholders of record on april  and november   respectively  were declared 
on april   the board of directors approved regular dividends of per share payable in the amount of per share on june  and per share on december  to shareholders of record on may  and november   respectively 
the amount paid in was million 
the company believes it has sufficient resources from cash flows from operating activities and  if necessary  from additional borrowings under its lines of credit to satisfy ongoing cash requirements for the next months 
proceeds from existing credit facilities and anticipated renewals  along with cash flows from operations  are expected to be sufficient to meet capital needs in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company s future contractual obligations for agreements  including agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business  are summarized below 
the weighted average interest rate for long term debt as of december  was 
payments due by period thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations long term debt includes estimated interest payments  interest payments on related variable rate debt were calculated using the effective interest rate at december  critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of accounting policies is intended to supplement note  general and summary of accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within the company s operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related statement of income  asset and or liability amounts 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
in certain instances  risk of ownership and title passes when the unit has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer 
sales are shown net of returns  discounts and sales incentives  which historically have not been significant 
the collectability of any related receivable is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in estimating the allowance  management considers factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
changes in these conditions may result in additional allowances 
inventory estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventory are based upon current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and will be written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit from which it was created 
based upon the estimated fair values of the company s reporting units using a discounted cash flow valuation  the goodwill at its road rescue subsidiary which is included in the company s evteam reportable segment was evaluated as impaired and goodwill totaling  was recognized as a charge against operating income during the remaining balance of the goodwill of the company relates to its crimson fire subsidiary and was not impaired as of december  warranties the company s policy is to record a provision for the estimated cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale  and periodically adjust the provision to reflect actual experience 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty agreements 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the number of units involved and the extent of features and components included in product models 
see also note  commitments and contingent liabilities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this k for further information regarding warranties 
equity compensation sfas r  share based payment  addresses the accounting for share based employee compensation and was adopted by spartan motors  inc on january  utilizing the modified prospective approach 
the effect of applying sfas r and further information on spartan motors  inc equity compensation plans  including inputs used to determine fair value of options and stock appreciation rights sars  is disclosed in note to the financial statements 
sfas r requires that share options and sars awarded to employees are recognized as compensation expense based on their fair value at grant date 
the fair market value of options and sars granted under the company s stock option plans was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for inputs such as interest rates  expected dividends  volatility measures and specific employee exercise behavior patterns based on statistical data 
some of the inputs the company uses are n ot market observable and have to be estimated or derived from available data 
use of different estimates would produce different values  which in turn would result in higher or lower compensation expense recognized 
the company has not run the model with alternative inputs to quantify their effects on the fair value of the options or sars 
to value options and sars  several recognized valuation models exist 
none of these models can be singled out as being the best or most correct one 
the model we apply is able to handle some of the specific features included in the awards we grant  which is the reason for its use 
if we were to use a different model  the values would differ despite using the same inputs 
accordingly  using different assumptions coupled with using a different valuation model could have a significant impact on the fair value of employee stock options and sars 
fair value could be either higher or lower than the ones produced by the model we apply and the inputs we used 
new and pending accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
effect of inflation inflation affects the company in two principal ways 
first  the company s revolving notes payable is generally tied to the prime and libor interest rates so that increases in those interest rates would be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  the company attempts to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of its products 
however  the company generally does not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into its contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as nine months  the company has limited ability to pass on cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the company s ability to pass through cost increases in many cases 
the company strives to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates and the effect of such a change on outstanding variable rate short term and long term debt 
at december   the company had no debt outstanding under its variable rate short term and long term debt agreements 
accordingly  an increase of in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
the company does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes 
the company does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss to the company 
as of the date of this report  the company does not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of its primary market risk exposure in the near term 
in this discussion  near term means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this report 
prevailing interest rates and interest rate relationships are primarily determined by market factors that are beyond the company s control 
all information provided in response to this item consists of forward looking statements
