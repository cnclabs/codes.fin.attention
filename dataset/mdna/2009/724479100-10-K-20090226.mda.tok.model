item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
overview revenue grew in to billion  of which acquisitions contributed 
income from continuing operations was million in compared with million in and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was compared with in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by restructuring charges and asset impairment charges of cents and cents  in and  respectively 
in  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations also included positive tax adjustments of cents related primarily to deferred tax assets associated with certain us leasing transactions 
in  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was also reduced by cents for the purchase accounting alignment of mapinfo  and cents for tax adjustments related principally to a valuation allowance for net operating losses outside the us despite volatile economic conditions  particularly in the second half of  certain of our business segments produced solid results  including both revenue and ebit growth at international mailing  mail services and marketing services 
in addition  international mailing  worldwide production mail  and marketing services improved their ebit margins as well 
these strong performances were offset by revenue declines at us mailing due to lower equipment sales due in part from the prior year stimulus from sales of shape based kits  lower financing and rental revenues 
also  declines in worldwide production mail were due to the effects of a slowdown in us sales as large enterprises curtailed large ticket capital expenditures due to ongoing credit constraints and global economic uncertainty 
in late  we announced a plan to lower our cost structure  accelerate efforts to improve operational efficiencies  enhance our customer experience  and to transition our product line 
on completion of this program  which continued throughout  we reduced our global workforce by roughly eight percent and improved margins in many of our business segments 
in addition  we generated million in cash from operations during see results of operations for  and for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations 
outlook our business model and the actions we have taken to significantly reduce costs and streamline our operations  will help mitigate  but do not eliminate the effects of prolonged global economic weakness and unanticipated currency fluctuations 
two external factors in particular  the strengthening of the us dollar and the japanese yen last year and the significant increase in pension costs related to recent changes in capital markets and other assumptions  will negatively impact reported results 
we expect our mix of revenue to continue to change  with a greater percentage of revenue coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and a smaller percentage from larger system sales 
in addition  we expect to derive further synergies from our recent acquisitions 
we will continue to remain focused on enhancing our productivity and to allocate capital in order to optimize our returns

revenue by source dollars in millions change equipment sales supplies software rentals financing support services business services total revenue equipment sales revenue decreased compared to the prior year 
lower sales of equipment in us mailing were primarily due to the postal rate case in  which resulted in incremental sales of mailing equipment shape based upgrade kits during that period and pulled sales forward from  weakening global economic conditions  and product shift toward smaller  fully featured postage machines

on april   we acquired mapinfo corporation for million in cash  net of cash acquired 
included in the assets and liabilities acquired were short term investments of million and debt assumed of million 
mapinfo is a global company and a leading provider of location intelligence software and solutions 
we assigned the goodwill to the software segment 
as part of the purchase accounting for mapinfo  we aligned mapinfo s accounting policies for software revenue recognition with ours 
accordingly  certain software revenue that was previously recognized by mapinfo on a periodic basis has now been recognized over the life of the contract 
we accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
acquisitions made in did not materially impact our diluted earnings per share for the year 
as a result of the purchase accounting alignment  the acquisition of mapinfo reduced our diluted earnings per share by cents in during and  we also completed several smaller acquisitions  the costs of which were million and million  respectively 
these acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash flow from operations  existing cash and liquid investments  as well as borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program  the existing credit facility and debt capital markets should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements and to cover our customer deposits 
our potential uses of cash include but are not limited to the following growth and expansion opportunities  internal investments  customer financing  tax payments  interest and dividend payments  share repurchase program  pension and other benefit plan funding  and acquisitions 
in light of recent market events  we have conducted an extensive review of our liquidity provisions 
we have carefully monitored for material changes in the creditworthiness of those banks acting as derivative counterparties  depository banks or credit providers to us through credit ratings and the credit default swap market 
we have determined that there has not been a material variation in the underlying sources of cash flows currently used to finance the operations of the company 
to date  we have had consistent access to the commercial paper market 
cash flow summary the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows dollars in millions cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows net cash provided by operations consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the strong cash flow provided by operations for is primarily due to the timing of tax payments  which favorably contributed million  and the receipt of million related to the unwind of an interest rate swap  which is described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting these positive impacts was a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  primarily due to timing of these payments 
net cash used in investing activities consisted of capital expenditures of million primarily for rental assets and acquisitions of million partially offset by proceeds from short term and other investments of million  and increased reserve account balances for customer deposits of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases of million  dividends paid of million  and a net payment of debt of million  which was partly offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock associated with employee stock plans 
we also paid million associated with the redemption of of the outstanding cumulative preferred stock issued previously by a subsidiary company 
cash flows net cash provided by operations consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the strong cash flow provided by operations for is primarily driven by tax refunds and lower tax payments  lower investment in finance receivables  and increased management attention on working capital which resulted in lower accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable balances 
net cash used in investing activities consisted of acquisitions of million and capital expenditures of million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a training facility for million  proceeds from short term investments of million  and increased reserve account balances for customer deposits of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases of million and dividends paid of million  primarily offset by a net borrowing of debt of million and proceeds from stock issuance of million 
capital expenditures during  capital expenditures included net additions of million to property  plant and equipment and million in net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with million and million  respectively  in the decrease in property  plant and equipment is due mostly to the continuing shift toward leased equipment in our management services segment 
financings and capitalization we have a commercial paper program that is a significant source of liquidity for the company 
during  we have continued to have consistent access to the commercial paper market 
as of december   we had million of outstanding commercial paper issuances 
we also have a committed line of credit of billion which supports commercial papers issuance and is provided by a syndicate of banks until as of december   this line of credit had not been drawn down 
in addition  we filed a well known seasoned issuer registration statement with the sec in june which permits the issuance of debt securities  preferred stock  preference stock  common stock  purchase contracts  depositary shares  warrants and units 
on march   we issued million of year fixed rate notes with a coupon rate of 
the interest is paid semi annually beginning september the notes mature on march  we simultaneously entered into two interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of million to convert the fixed rate debt to a floating rate obligation bearing interest at month libor plus basis points 
the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper and repurchase of our stock 
in december  we entered into a million syndicated bank transaction priced at month libor plus basis points 
the proceeds from this credit facility  due  were used to pay off the million variable rate debt that was due in in september  we issued million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in september these notes bear interest at an annual rate of and pay interest semi annually beginning in march the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper  the financing of acquisitions and repurchase of our stock 
we believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally  borrowing capacity from existing credit agreements  available debt issuances under existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper program 
information on debt maturities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes our known contractual obligations at december  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods contractual obligations payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years commercial paper borrowings long term debt and current portion of long term debt non cancelable operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other non current liabilities relate primarily to our postretirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount and period of future payments related to our fin income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and  therefore  is not included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
critical accounting estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the md a 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  customer cancellations  bad debts  inventory obsolescence  residual values of leased assets  useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation  and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with gaap 
revenue recognition multiple element and internal financing arrangements we derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales  rentals  financing and services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease  a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values  which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions 
revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments 
we then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices 
we provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases 
we classify our leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
the vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in sfas no 
we believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs 
accordingly  we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue  the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables 
the difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease 
equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term 
estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience 
we also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products  product retirement and future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  regulatory changes  remanufacturing strategies  used equipment markets  if any  competition and technological changes 
we evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the transition of our product line 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
based on historical experience  we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
we establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed 
we charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible 
we base credit decisions primarily on a customer s financial strength 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification 
our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over days is to discontinue revenue recognition 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which supplements statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin requires a two step approach under which the tax effect of a position is recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained and the amount of the tax benefit recognized is equal to the largest tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement of the tax position 
this is a different standard for recognition than the approach previously required 
both approaches require us to exercise considerable judgment and estimates are inherent in both processes 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications 
we have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
we adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
based on our income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest  a change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately million 
long lived assets useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives machinery and equipment principally to years and buildings up to years 
we depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally to years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which are principally to years 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans 
impairment review we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant 
our goodwill impairment review requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit

pension benefits assumptions and estimates the valuation and calculation of our net pension expense  assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates 
we make assumptions relating to discount rate  rate of compensation increase  expected return on plan assets and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following assumptions relate to our us qualified pension plan  which is our largest plan 
we determine our discount rate for the us retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each year s estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate 
these spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
accordingly  our discount rate assumption was at december  and at december  the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was at december  and at december  our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  the plan s asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan 
our expected return on plan assets assumption was in and at december  sensitivity to changes in assumptions us pension plan discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by million 
rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
the following assumptions relate to our uk qualified pension plan  which is our largest foreign plan 
we determine our discount rate for the uk retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each year s estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate 
these spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
accordingly  our discount rate assumption was at december  and at december  the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was at december  and at december  our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  the plan s asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan 
our expected return on plan assets assumption was in and at december  uk pension plan discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by million 
rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
delayed recognition principles in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets 
in accordance with this approach  we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded

the composition of our uk pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and cash 
investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
in particular  due to the level of risk associated with equity securities  it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which supplements statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin requires the tax effect of a position to be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits  no benefits of the position are recognized 
this is a different standard for recognition than was previously required 
the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
at adoption  companies adjusted their financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that were more likely than not to be sustained as of the adoption date 
any necessary adjustment was recorded directly to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption and reported as a change in accounting principle

sfas r requires fair value measurements at the date of acquisition  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
some of the major impacts of this new standard include expense recognition for transaction costs and restructuring costs

sfas addresses the accounting and reporting for the outstanding noncontrolling interest previously referred to as minority interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it also establishes additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent s owners and of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
sfas requires changes in ownership interest that do not result in deconsolidation to be accounted for as equity transactions 
this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
this gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  sfas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  for an entity to consider  when determining the useful life of an acquired intangible asset  whether the intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modification to the existing terms and conditions associated with the intangible asset 
fsp fas replaces the previous useful life assessment criteria with a requirement that an entity considers its own experience in renewing similar arrangements 
if the entity has no relevant experience  it would consider market participant assumptions regarding renewal 
this should lead to greater consistency between the useful life of recognized intangibles under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value of such assets under sfas no

legal and regulatory matters legal see legal proceedings in item of this form k for information regarding our legal proceedings 
income taxes we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
the amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserves is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we are continually under examination by tax authorities in the united states  other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations 
the years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
the current irs exam of tax years is estimated to be completed within the next two years 
in connection with this exam  we have recently received notices of proposed adjustments to our filed returns 
we have accrued our best estimate of the tax  interest and penalties that may result from these proposed adjustments in accordance with fin we are disputing a formal request from the irs in the form of a civil summons to provide certain company workpapers 
we believe that certain documents being sought should not be produced because they are privileged 
in a similar case  the us court of appeals for the first circuit ruled that certain company workpapers were privileged  however  the case was remanded to the lower court to consider other related issues 
also in connection with the audits  we have entered into a settlement with the irs regarding the tax treatment of certain lease transactions related to the capital services business that we sold in prior to  we accrued and paid the irs the additional tax and interest associated with this settlement 
a variety of post tax years remain subject to examination by other tax authorities  including the uk  canada  france  germany and various us states 
we have accrued our best estimate of the tax  interest and penalties that may result from these tax uncertainties in these and other jurisdictions in accordance with fin however  the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in august  we reached a settlement with the irs governing all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years through accordingly  in we recorded million of additional tax expense 
of the million  million related to the capital services business and was included in discontinued operations and million was included in continuing operations 
the federal statute of limitations for these years has now expired 
in  we accrued in discontinued operations an additional tax expense of million to record the impact of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act tipra 
the tipra legislation repealed the exclusion from federal income taxation of a portion of the income generated from certain leveraged leases of aircraft by foreign sales corporations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the discontinued operations 
during  we expect to reverse tax benefits of approximately to million associated with the expiration of vested stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units previously granted to our employees 
this write off of deferred tax assets will not increase the amount of tax to be paid 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation  although moderate in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs and the usps meter migration initiatives  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels  and  where applicable  price increases 
currency translation increased our revenue by approximately 
also  currency translation gains increased our income before taxes by million 
based on the current contribution from our international operations  a increase in the value of the us dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest of approximately million 
although not affecting income  balance sheet related deferred translation losses of million were recorded in resulting primarily from the strengthening us dollar as compared to the british pound  euro and canadian dollar 
during  we recorded deferred translation gains of million resulting primarily from the stronger british pound  euro and canadian dollar  as compared to the us dollar 
during  we recorded deferred translation gains of million resulting primarily from the stronger british pound  euro and canadian dollar  as compared to the us dollar 
the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to reduce our risk of loss from such fluctuations 
exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries  and intercompany loans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
at december   we had million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding  all maturing in  to buy or sell various currencies 
as a result of the use of derivative instruments  we are exposed to counterparty risk 
to mitigate such risks  we enter into contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy 
we regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
dividends it is a general practice of our board of directors to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since forward looking statements we want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in this form k  other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
these forward looking statements are those which talk about our current expectations as to the future and include  but are not limited to  statements about the amounts  timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings 
words such as estimate  project  plan  believe  expect  anticipate  intend  and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies 
we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by limiting its impact on earnings and cash flows and lowering our overall borrowing costs 
we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps to execute our strategy 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies actively hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
