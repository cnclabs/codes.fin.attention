item a risk factors the following is a discussion of significant risk factors relevant to grainger s business that could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 
weakness in the united states and international economies could negatively impact grainger s sales growth 
economic and industry trends affect grainger s business environments 
economic downturns can cause customers to idle or close facilities  delay purchases and otherwise reduce their ability to purchase grainger s products and services as well as their ability to make full and timely payments 
thus  a significant or prolonged slowdown in economic activity could negatively impact grainger s sales growth and results of operations 
the recent global economic crisis has had a negative effect on grainger s sales and could continue to do so into the future  however  the duration of this or any other economic downturn cannot be predicted 
the facilities maintenance industry is highly fragmented  and changes in competition could result in a decreased demand for grainger s products and services 
there are several large competitors in the industry  although most of the market is served by small local and regional competitors 
grainger faces competition in all markets it serves  from manufacturers including some of its own suppliers that sell directly to certain segments of the market  wholesale distributors  catalog houses and retail enterprises 
competitive pressures could adversely affect grainger s sales and profitability 
volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect operating margins 
some of grainger s products contain significant amounts of commodity priced materials  such as steel  copper  or oil  and are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market 
grainger s ability to pass on increases in costs depends on market conditions 
the inability to pass along costs increases could result in lower operating margins 
in addition  higher prices could impact demand for these products resulting in lower sales volumes 
unexpected product shortages could negatively impact customer relationships  resulting in an adverse impact on results of operations 
grainger s competitive strengths include product selection and availability 
products are purchased from approximately  key suppliers  no one of which accounts for more than of purchases 
historically  no significant difficulty has been encountered with respect to sources of supply  however  economic downturns can adversely affect a supplier s ability to manufacture or deliver products 
if grainger were to experience difficulty in obtaining products  there could be a short term adverse effect on results of operations and a longer term adverse effect on customer relationships and grainger s reputation 
in addition  grainger has strategic relationships with key vendors 
in the event grainger was unable to maintain those relations  there might be a loss of competitive pricing advantages which could  in turn  adversely affect results of operations 
the addition of new product lines could impact future sales growth 
grainger  from time to time  expands the breadth of its offerings by increasing the number of products it distributes 
in  grainger launched a multiyear product line expansion program 
the continued success of the expansion program is expected to be a driver of growth in and beyond 
the success of these expansions will depend on grainger s ability to accurately forecast market demand  obtain products from suppliers and effectively integrate these products into the supply chain 
as such  there is a risk that the product line expansion program will not deliver the expected results which could negatively impact anticipated future sales growth 
interruptions in the proper functioning of information systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs and or decreases in revenues 
the proper functioning of grainger s information systems is critical to the successful operation of its business 
although grainger s information systems are protected with robust backup systems  including physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities  information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters  power losses  unauthorized access  telecommunication failures and other problems 
if critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable  grainger s ability to process orders  maintain proper levels of inventories  collect accounts receivable  pay expenses and maintain the security of company and customer data could be adversely affected 
in order to compete  grainger must attract  retain and motivate key employees  and the failure to do so could have an adverse effect on results of operations 
in order to compete and have continued growth  grainger must attract  retain and motivate executives and other key employees  including those in managerial  technical  sales  marketing and support positions 
grainger competes to hire employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies 
grainger s operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 
fluctuations in foreign currency could have an adverse effect on reported results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on sales  future costs or on future cash flows from international operations  and could adversely affect reported financial performance

item legal proceedings grainger has been named  along with numerous other nonaffiliated companies  as a defendant in litigation in various states involving asbestos and or silica 
these lawsuits typically assert claims of personal injury arising from alleged exposure to asbestos and or silica as a consequence of products purportedly distributed by grainger 
as of february   grainger is named in cases filed on behalf of approximately  plaintiffs in which there is an allegation of exposure to asbestos and or silica 
grainger has denied  or intends to deny  the allegations in all of the above described lawsuits 
in  lawsuits relating to asbestos and or silica and involving approximately plaintiffs were dismissed with respect to grainger  typically based on the lack of product identification 
if a specific product distributed by grainger is identified in any of these lawsuits  grainger would attempt to exercise indemnification remedies against the product manufacturer 
in addition  grainger believes that a substantial number of these claims are covered by insurance 
grainger has entered agreements with its major insurance carriers relating to the scope  coverage and costs of defense 
while grainger is unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits  it believes that the ultimate resolution will not have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on grainger s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
grainger is a party to a contract with the united states general services administration the gsa first entered into in and subsequently extended in the gsa contract had been the subject of an audit performed by the gsa s office of the inspector general 
in december  the company received a letter from the commercial litigation branch of the civil division of the department of justice the doj regarding the gsa contract 
the letter suggested that the company had not complied with its disclosure obligations and the contract s pricing provisions  and had potentially overcharged government customers under the contract 
discussions relating to the company s compliance with its disclosure obligations and the contract s pricing provisions are ongoing 
the timing and outcome of these discussions are uncertain and could include settlement or civil litigation by the doj to recover  among other amounts  treble damages and penalties under the false claims act 
while this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  an unfavorable resolution could result in significant payments by the company 
the company continues to believe that it has complied with the gsa contract in all material respects 
in addition to the foregoing  from time to time grainger is involved in various other legal and administrative proceedings that are incidental to its business  including claims relating to product liability  general negligence  environmental issues  employment  intellectual property and other matters 
as a government contractor  grainger is also subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits or other proceedings  including those related to pricing compliance 
it is not expected that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on grainger s consolidated financial position or results of operations

manufacturing employment levels in the united states declined approximately from december to december  while manufacturing output decreased from december to december this decline in manufacturing employment and output contributed to low single digit sales growth in the light manufacturing customer sector and flat sales growth in the heavy manufacturing customer sector for grainger in given the steep decline in the economic trends in grainger s markets in the fourth quarter of  it is difficult to project future results 
during the fourth quarter  grainger began implementing contingency plans to deal with the changing environment  which included a hiring freeze on all non customer facing positions  a reduction in hours of part time employees and a significant reduction to travel  consulting and relocation expenses 
in response to a continuing decline in sales  on february   grainger announced plans to freeze salaries of all executives and salaried employees and indicated that the payment of management incentive bonuses for would occur only if grainger meets aggressive sales targets

in addition  funds were expended for facilities optimization and enhancements to support growth initiatives  as well as for business and systems development and other infrastructure improvements 
working capital was  million at december   compared with million at december  and  million at december  at these dates  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was  and the increase in the current ratio and working capital for primarily relates to increases in cash and inventories and the replacement of short term borrowings with long term borrowings 
capital expenditures in each of the past three years  a portion of operating cash flow has been used for additions to property  buildings  equipment and capitalized software as summarized in the following table in thousands of dollars for the years ended december  land  buildings  structures and improvements furniture  fixtures  machinery and equipment subtotal capitalized software total in  grainger completed its investments in the market expansion program in the united states which realigned branches in the top major metropolitan areas

capital expenditures are expected to range from million to million in projected investments include improved infrastructure in distribution centers  both in the us and canada  information technology  including upgraded electronic commerce platforms  and the normal recurring replacement of equipment 
grainger expects to fund capital investments from operating cash flows 
debt grainger maintains a debt ratio and liquidity position that provides flexibility in funding working capital needs and long term cash requirements 
in addition to internally generated funds  grainger has various sources of financing available  including bank borrowings under lines of credit 
a four year bank term loan of million was obtained in may at december   grainger s long term debt rating by standard poor s was aa 
grainger s available lines of credit  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  were million at december   and total debt as a percent of total capitalization was  and as of the same dates 
the increase in total debt as a percent of total capitalization in was primarily the result of the million bank term loan 
grainger believes any circumstances that would trigger early payment or acceleration with respect to any outstanding debt securities would not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
commitments and other contractual obligations at december   grainger s contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by period  are as follows in thousands of dollars payments due by period total amounts committed less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations uncompleted additions to property  buildings and equipment commitments to purchase inventory other purchase obligations other liabilities total purchase obligations for inventory are made in the normal course of business to meet operating needs 
while purchase orders for both inventory purchases and noninventory purchases are generally cancelable without penalty  certain vendor agreements provide for cancellation fees or penalties depending on the terms of the contract 
other liabilities represent future benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans and postemployment disability medical benefits as determined by actuarial projections 
other employment related benefits costs of million have not been included in this table as the timing of benefit payments is not statistically predictable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
see also notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further detail related to the interest on long term debt and operating lease obligations  respectively 
grainger has recorded a noncurrent liability of million for tax uncertainties and interest at december  this amount is excluded from the table above  as grainger cannot make reliable estimates of these cash flows by period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements grainger does not have any material exposures to off balance sheet arrangements 
grainger does not have any variable interest entities or activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in the financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions  which it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from these estimates  the revisions are included in grainger s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
accounting policies are considered critical when they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and when there are different estimates that management reasonably could have made  which would have a material impact on the presentation of grainger s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates follow 
actual results in these areas could differ materially from management s estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
grainger uses several factors to estimate the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable including the age of the receivables and the historical ratio of actual write offs to the age of the receivables 
the analyses performed also take into consideration economic conditions that may have an impact on a specific industry  group of customers or a specific customer 
write offs could be materially different than the reserves provided if economic conditions change or actual results deviate from historical trends 
inventory reserves 
grainger establishes inventory reserves for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory 
provisions for inventory shrinkage are based on historical experience to account for unmeasured usage or loss 
actual inventory shrinkage could be materially different from these estimates  affecting grainger s inventory values and cost of merchandise sold 
grainger regularly reviews inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory 
grainger records provisions for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value 
estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand  market conditions and liquidation values 
actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on grainger s results of operations 
stock incentive plans 
grainger maintains stock incentive plans under which a variety of incentive grants may be awarded to employees and directors 
grainger uses a binomial lattice option pricing model to estimate the value of stock option grants 
the model requires projections of the risk free interest rate  expected life  volatility  expected dividend yield and forfeiture rate of the stock option grants 
the fair value estimate of options granted used the following assumptions for the years ended december  risk free interest rate expected life years years years expected volatility expected dividend yield the risk free interest rate is selected based on yields from us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected term of the options being valued 
the expected life selected for options granted during each year presented represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding based on historical data of option holders exercise and termination behavior 
expected volatility is based upon implied and historical volatility of the closing price of grainger s stock over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant 
the dividend yield assumption is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts 
because stock option compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures  using historical forfeiture experience 
the amount of stock option compensation expense is significantly affected by the valuation model and these assumptions 
if a different valuation model or different assumptions were used  the stock option compensation expense could be significantly different from what is recorded in the current period 
compensation expense for other stock based awards is based upon the closing market price on the last trading date preceding the date of the grant 
for additional information concerning stock incentive plans  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
postretirement healthcare benefits 
postretirement healthcare obligations and net periodic costs are dependent on assumptions and estimates used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions used include  among others  discount rates  assumed rates of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates 
changes in assumptions caused by conditions in equity markets or plan experience  for example could have a material effect on grainger s postretirement benefit obligations and expense  and could affect its results of operations and financial condition 
these changes in assumptions may also affect voluntary decisions to make additional contributions to the trust established for funding the postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumptions used by management reflect the rates available on high quality fixed income debt instruments as of december  the measurement date  of each year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs 
as of december   grainger decreased the discount rate used in the calculation of its postretirement plan obligation from to to reflect the decrease in market interest rates 
grainger estimates that the decrease in the expected discount rate will decrease pretax earnings by approximately million  although other changes in assumptions may increase  decrease or eliminate this effect 
grainger considers the long term historical actual return on plan assets and the historical performance of the standard poor s index in developing its expected long term return on plan assets 
in  grainger maintained the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of net of tax at based on the historical average of long term rates of return 
a percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have had the following effects on december  results in thousands of dollars percentage point increase decrease effect on total of service and interest cost effect on accumulated postretirement benefitobligation grainger may terminate or modify the postretirement plan at any time  subject to the provisions of the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the internal revenue code  as amended 
in the event the postretirement plan is terminated  all assets of the group benefit trust inure to the benefit of the participants 
the foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the postretirement plan will continue 
were the postretirement plan to terminate  different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable 
grainger has used its best judgment in making assumptions and estimates and believes such assumptions and estimates used are appropriate 
changes to the assumptions may be required in future years as a result of actual experience or new trends and  therefore  may affect grainger s retirement plan obligations and future expense 
for additional information concerning postretirement healthcare benefits  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves 
grainger retains a significant portion of the risk of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability and property losses through the utilization of high deductibles and self insured retentions 
there are also certain other risk areas for which grainger does not maintain insurance 
grainger is responsible for establishing accounting policies on insurance reserves 
although it relies on outside parties to project future claims costs  it retains control over actuarial assumptions  including loss development factors and claim payment patterns 
grainger performs ongoing reviews of its insured and uninsured risks  which it uses to establish the appropriate reserve levels 
the use of assumptions in the analysis leads to fluctuations in required reserves over time 
any change in the required reserve balance is reflected in the current period s results of operations 
income taxes 
grainger recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the tax balances and income tax expense recognized by grainger are based on management s interpretations of the tax laws of multiple jurisdictions 
income tax expense reflects grainger s best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other items  the level of future taxable income  interpretation of tax laws and tax planning opportunities 
future rulings by tax authorities and future changes in tax laws and their interpretation  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could impact the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by grainger 
other 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies such as revenue recognition  depreciation  intangibles  long lived assets and warranties require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
possible changes in estimates or assumptions associated with these policies are not expected to have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of grainger 
more information on these additional accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements

the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company currently does not have any noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  therefore does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on its results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued staff position eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp 
fsp states that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
upon adoption  a company is required to retrospectively adjust its earnings per share data presentation to conform with the fsp provisions 
fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company s unvested share based payment awards  such as performance shares  restricted stock and restricted stock units see note to the consolidated financial statements that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends meet the criteria of a participating security as defined by fsp accordingly  the adoption of fsp will change the methodology of computing the company s earnings per share to the two class method 
this change will not affect previously reported consolidated net earnings or net cash flows from operations 
under the two class method  earnings will be allocated between common stock and participating securities  resulting in lower earnings per share

inflation and changing prices inflation during the last three years has not had a significant effect on operations 
the predominant use of the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories and accelerated depreciation methods for financial reporting and income tax purposes result in a substantial recognition of the effects of inflation in the financial statements 
the major impact of inflation is on buildings and improvements  where the gap between historic cost and replacement cost accumulates for these long lived assets 
the related depreciation expense associated with these assets would likely increase if adjustments were to be made for the cumulative effect of inflation 
grainger believes the most positive means to combat inflation and advance the interests of investors lies in the continued application of basic business principles  which include improving productivity  maintaining working capital turnover and offering products and services which can command appropriate prices in the marketplace 
forward looking statements this form k contains statements that are not historical in nature but concern future results and business plans  strategies and objectives and other matters that may be deemed to be forward looking statements under the federal securities laws 
grainger has generally identified such forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate  anticipated  assumed  assumes  assumption  assumptions  believe  believes  contingency  continue  continued  continues  could  estimate  estimated  estimates  expect  expectation  expected  expects  forecasts  intended  intends  may  might  percent complete  planned  predict  predictable  predicted  presumption  project  projected  projecting  projection  projections  potential  reasonably likely  scheduled  should  unlikely  will  and would or similar expressions 
grainger cannot guarantee that any forward looking statement will be realized  although grainger does believe that its assumptions underlying its forward looking statements are reasonable 
achievement of future results is subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause grainger s results to differ materially from those which are presented 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented or implied in a forward looking statement include  without limitation higher product costs or other expenses  a major loss of customers  loss or disruption of source of supply  increased competitive pricing pressures  failure to develop or implement new technologies or business strategies  the outcome of pending and future litigation or governmental or regulatory proceedings  investigations  inquiries  audits and changes in laws and regulations  disruption of information technology or data security systems  general industry or market conditions  general global economic conditions  currency exchange rate fluctuations  market volatility  commodity price volatility  labor shortages  facilities disruptions or shutdowns  higher fuel costs or disruptions in transportation services  natural and other catastrophes  unanticipated weather conditions  and the factors identified in item a  risk factors 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on grainger s forward looking statements and grainger undertakes no obligation to publicly update the forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk grainger is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to its transactions  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
for  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net earnings 
comparatively  in a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect grainger and its joint ventures would have resulted in a million decrease in net earnings 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar would have resulted in a million increase in net earnings for  as compared with an increase in net earnings of million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices or costs 
grainger does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
grainger is also exposed to interest rate risk in its debt portfolio 
during and  all of its long term debt was variable rate debt 
a percentage point increase in interest rates paid by grainger would have resulted in a decrease to net earnings of approximately million for and million for a percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase to net earnings of approximately million for and million for this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates on long term debt does not factor in potential changes in long term debt levels 
grainger has limited primary exposure to commodity price risk on certain products for resale  but does not purchase commodities directly
