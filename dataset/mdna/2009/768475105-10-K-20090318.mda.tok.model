item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
general as discussed previously  river valley was incorporated for the primary purpose of owning all of the outstanding shares of river valley financial 
as a result  the discussion that follows focuses on river valley financial s financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition as of december   and river valley s results of operations for periods prior to that date  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included in item of this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
river valley s operations and river valley s actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include  but are not limited to  changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and river valley s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include those with respect to the following matters management s determination as to the amount and adequacy of the loan loss allowance  the effect of changes in interest rates on financial condition and results of operations  and management s opinion as to the effect of recent accounting pronouncements on river valley s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
effect of current events the global and us economies are experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system during the past year 
dramatic declines in the housing market during the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
the availability of credit  confidence in the financial sector  and level of volatility in the financial markets have been significantly adversely affected as a result 
in recent weeks  volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  the government has responded with a number of new and amended regulatory provisions 
many of these provisions directly or indirectly impact the company  including the eesa  tarp and the related cpp program  and changes to the federal deposit insurance program 
many of these new regulations and their effect on the company are discussed in item business regulation 
although the company s fundamental banking practices and policies have protected it from the significant write downs and disruption being experienced in the industry  the company will continue to monitor and enhance its stability in this uncertain environment 
in november  although the bank met all applicable regulatory capital requirements and remained well capitalized  the company made a preliminary determination that obtaining additional capital pursuant to the cpp for contribution in whole or in part to the bank might become advisable 
as a result  the company filed an initial application pursuant to the cpp with its regulator  the ots  seeking approval to sell  in preferred stock to the treasury which equalled approximately of its total risk weighted assets as of september  
the company received preliminary approval of its application  and the company called a special meeting of shareholders on march   to consider whether to amend the company s articles of incorporation in a manner that would permit the company to issue preferred stock to the treasury or similar investors 
although the shareholders approved the amendment of the articles of incorporation  which became effective on march   the board of directors  after careful consideration  has determined the company will decline to participate in the tarp s cpp 
institutions like the company were expected and encouraged by their regulators to apply for capital infusions through the cpp  even though the bank is well capitalized by regulatory standards 
after the treasury announced the cpp as part of its emergency legislation  the applications were due less than a month after release of the application guidelines 
many companies  like us  applied for the funds as a way to preserve the option while engaging in a more thorough review of the advantages and consequences 
this review has been complicated by ongoing adoption of new legislation and new regulations that will apply to recipients of the tarp money  many of which stipulations conflict with each other or are unclear 
in fact  after the changes implemented as recently as february   with the adoption of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  companies that have already closed and accepted tarp money have been given the option of returning the money and leaving the program 
the board of directors  after evaluating many factors affecting the company s capitalization  including the state of the national and local economy  our loan quality  and our general conservative banking practices  among other things  has determined that the company will not participate in the tarp s cpp 
eesa followed  and has been followed by  numerous actions by the federal reserve  congress  treasury  the sec and others to address the current liquidity and credit crisis that has followed the sub prime meltdown that commenced in these measures include homeowner relief that encourage loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  including two basis point decreases in october of  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
it is not clear at this time what impact the eesa  the tarp cpp  the temporary liquidity guarantee program  arra and other liquidity and funding initiatives  whether previously announced or that may be initiated in the future  will have on the financial markets and the other difficulties described above  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced  or on the us banking and financial industries and the broader us and global economies 
further adverse effects could have an adverse effect on the company and its business 
the level of turmoil in the financial services industry will present unusual risks and challenges for the company  as described below the current economic environment poses challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  including generally uncertain national conditions and local conditions in our markets 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than months 
the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
the risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth 
financial institutions continue to be affected by sharp declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets 
while we are taking steps to decrease and limit our exposure to problem loans  we nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets  and we are affected by these events 
our loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans  residential mortgage loans  and construction and land development loans 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a possible national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following other consequences increases in loan delinquencies  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for our products and services may decline  deposits may decrease  which would adversely impact our liquidity position  and collateral for our loans  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans 
impact of recent and future legislation 
congress and the treasury department have recently adopted legislation and taken actions to address the disruptions in the financial system and declines in the housing market 
see item business regulation recent legislative developments 
it is not clear at this time what impact eesa  tarp  arra and other liquidity and funding initiatives of the treasury and other bank regulatory agencies that have been previously announced  and any additional programs that may be initiated in the future  will have on the financial markets and the financial services industry 
the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced could continue to affect the us banking industry and the broader us and global economies  which will have an effect on all financial institutions  including the company 
the actual impact that eesa  arra and related measures undertaken to alleviate the credit crisis will have on the financial markets is unknown 
the failure of such measures to help stabilize the financial markets  and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
finally  there can be no assurance regarding the specific impact that such measures may have on us and no assurance whether or to what extent we will be able to benefit from such programs 
in addition to the legislation mentioned above  federal and state governments could pass additional legislation responsive to current credit conditions 
as an example  the bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that reduces the amount the bank s borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts 
also  the bank could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits its ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible 
additional increases in insurance premiums 
the fdic insures the bank s deposits up to certain limits 
the fdic charges us premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund 
the bank elected to participate in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  which will increase its insurance premiums by basis points per annum with respect to the bank s deposits 
current economic conditions have increased expectations for bank failures 
the fdic takes control of failed banks and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the deposit insurance fund 
the fdic has designated the deposit insurance fund long term target reserve ratio at percent of insured deposits 
due to recent bank failures  the fdic insurance fund reserve ratio has fallen below percent  the statutory minimum 
the fdic has developed a restoration plan that will uniformly increase insurance assessments by basis points annualized effective january  effective april   the plan also has made changes to the deposit insurance assessment system resulting in increases in the assessment range for insured institutions 
further increases in premium assessments would increase the company s expenses 
also  the fdic has announced a basis point special assessment payable in september possibly to be reduced to a basis point assessment  as well as the possibility of additional special assessments of up to basis points after june  as necessary 
see item business regulation insurance of deposits 
increased assessment rates and special assessments could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings 
future reduction in liquidity in the banking system 
the federal reserve bank has been providing vast amounts of liquidity into the banking system to compensate for weaknesses in short term borrowing markets and other capital markets 
a reduction in the federal reserve s activities or capacity could reduce liquidity in the markets  thereby increasing funding costs to the bank or reducing the availability of funds to the bank to finance its existing operations 
difficult market conditions have adversely affected our industry 
we are particularly exposed to downturns in the us housing market 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and securities and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities  major commercial and investment banks  and regional financial institutions 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including to other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we expect to face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approach we use to select  manage and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
we may be required to pay significantly higher deposit insurance premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
concentrations of real estate loans could subject the company to increased risks in the event of a real estate recession or natural disaster 
a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real estate 
the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
a weakening of the real estate market in our primary market area could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
historically  indiana and kentucky have experienced  on occasion  significant natural disasters  including tornadoes and floods 
the availability of insurance for losses for such catastrophes is limited 
our operations could also be interrupted by such natural disasters 
acts of nature  including tornadoes and floods  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures our loans or interruption in our business operations  may also negatively impact our operating results or financial condition 
critical accounting policies note to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the company s significant accounting policies for the year ended december  certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s assumptions about specific borrowers and current economic and business conditions  among other factors 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation by management includes consideration of past loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  the current economic condition  the amount of loans outstanding  certain identified problem loans  and the probability of collecting all amounts due 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the company s loan portfolios 
in determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for loan losses  management makes numerous assumptions  estimates and assessments 
the company s strategy for credit risk management includes conservative  centralized credit policies  and uniform underwriting criteria for all loans as well as an overall credit limit for each customer significantly below legal lending limits 
the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic  industry and customer level  regular credit quality reviews and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality 
the company s allowance consists of three components probable incurred losses estimated from individual reviews of specific loans  probable incurred losses estimated from historical loss rates  and probable incurred losses resulting from economic or other deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the first two components of the allowance 
larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  reserves are allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the company 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
any allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans are not individually risk graded 
rather  standard credit scoring systems are used to assess credit risks 
reserves are established for each pool of loans based on the expected net charge offs for one year 
loss rates are based on the average net charge off history by loan category 
historical loss rates for commercial and consumer loans may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies  trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquencies  charge offs and nonaccrual loans  changes in mix  credit score migration comparisons  asset quality trends  risk management and loan administration  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the company s internal loan review 
an unallocated reserve is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans or pools of loans 
allowances on individual loans and historical loss rates are reviewed no less than quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge off experience 
the company s primary market area for lending is clark  floyd and jefferson counties in southeastern indiana and portions of northeastern kentucky adjacent to that market 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowance  consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the company s customers 
the company has not substantively changed any aspect to its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance 
as the national economy worsened  the bank aggressively managed delinquencies  with overall delinquencies or more days past due as of december  at  compared to at the same date in non performing loans as of december  were million  compared to million at the same date in  and non performing loans as a percent of total loans were 
and 
respectively for those periods 
foreclosures were actively processed and at december   the bank held  in real estate owned  as compared to  at the same date a year earlier 
in anticipation of an unavoidable decline in the local economy  the bank increased its analysis of problem loans and established higher levels of specific reserves for potential losses 
net charge offs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period in the major portion of the year to year increase was the charge off of one relationship totaling  valuation of mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the total cost of loans  when sold  is allocated between loans and mortgage servicing rights based on the relative fair values of each 
mortgage servicing rights are subsequently carried at the lower of the initial carrying value  adjusted for amortization  or fair value 
mortgage servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of those rights 
factors included in the calculation of fair value of the mortgage servicing rights include estimating the present value of future net cash flows  market loan prepayment speeds for similar loans  discount rates  servicing costs  and other economic factors 
servicing rights are amortized over the estimated period of net servicing revenue 
it is likely that these economic factors will change over the life of the mortgage servicing rights  resulting in different valuations of the mortgage servicing rights 
the differing valuations will affect the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights on the consolidated balance sheet as well as the income recorded from loan servicing in the consolidated income statement 
as of december   mortgage servicing rights had a carrying value of  discussion of changes in financial condition from december  to december  at december   river valley s consolidated assets totaled million  representing an increase of million  or  over the december  total 
the increase in assets was primarily attributable to growth in the loan portfolio  from million at december  to million at the same date in  a growth of million or 
asset growth was funded by similar growth in deposits with total deposits at december  of million  an increase of million  or  compared to total deposits at december  savings and demand deposits decreased by million  or  during  while certificates of deposit experienced significant growth of million  or  for total certificates of deposit at december  totaled million compared to million for strong growth on both sides of the balance sheet point to the effectiveness of the bank s expansion into new markets in floyd and clark counties in indiana  and continued strong market share in the jefferson county  indiana area 
liquid assets ie  cash  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits and certificates of deposit increased slightly by million from december  levels to a total of million at december  investment securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million from the million at december  maturities in the investment portfolio were used to fund loan growth 
in september of the company formed an investment subsidiary in nevada with the sole purpose of holding investment securities  as interest on these investments is not subject to state taxation 
this has resulted in tax savings for the company 
investments reported in the financial statements of the company are held both at the bank level and at the bank s nevada subsidiaries 
the company evaluates all investments for other than temporary impairment quarterly 
brought detailed scrutiny of the company s investments  and in particular of asset quality and changes in the fair values of the individual investments 
the company securities are valued at fair value by a pricing service whose prices can be corroborated by recent security trading activities 
the company s portfolio is comprised of the following agency investments  which includes aaa rated federal home loan mortgage fhlmc  federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan bank fhlb investments  at an average book yield of  were at an unrealized gain position at december  the total carrying value of million represents of the total investment portfolio 
collateralized mortgage obligations  which includes fhlmc remics  at an average book yield of  were at an unrealized gain position at december  the total carrying value of million represents of the total investment portfolio 
mortgage backed securities  which includes fhlmc gold pools and fnma pools  at an average book yield of were at an unrealized gain position at december  the total carrying value of million represents of the total investment portfolio 
municipal securities from a variety of sources  with an average tax equivalent yield of  were at a net unrealized loss position at december  these investments were rated baa or better with of these bonds rated a or better 
two thirds of these investments are general obligation go bonds and the remainder are revenue bonds 
the total carrying value of million represents of the total investment portfolio 
at december   municipal securities were at an unrealized loss position with gross unrealized losses totaling  while these investments were at a net unrealized loss at december   none of these investments was at an unrealized loss for consecutive months or more 
in addition  we are not aware of any credit quality issues 
management has the ability and intent to hold these securities to recovery  which may be maturity 
management has concluded that the impairment of these securities is temporary at december  and is primarily a function of current rates and market conditions 
corporate investments  rated a or better  with an average book yield of  were at a net unrealized loss position at december   but none was at an unrealized loss for consecutive months or more 
corporate investments  with total carrying value of million represent of the total investment portfolio 
corporate investments included three  or million  of corporate obligations and two  or million  of inactively traded trust preferred issues 
the corporate obligations with a fair value of million had an amortized cost of million at december  the corporate obligations were rated a  aaa and a at december  management has concluded that the impairment of these securities is temporary at december  and is primarily a function of current rates and market conditions 
both issues of trust preferred are pools of financial institution and insurance trust debt 
since these issues are not actively traded  and represent some potential risk to the company simply by virtue of their attributes  they are discussed individually below 
in november  the company purchased million face value of alesc a aa class preferred trust stock at a price of 
at december   this investment was priced by a third party pricing service  at  a market value of  and an amortized cost on that date of  the net unrealized loss on this investment at december  was  the company has reviewed the pricing analytics reports for this investment and has determined that the decline in the market price of this investment is temporary and indicates thin trading activity  rather than a true decline in the value of the investment 
factors considered in reaching this determination included the class or tranche held by the company  aa  the current collateral position of the tranche  projected cash flows as of december  and the credit rating of aaa 
in february  the company purchased million face value of pretsl xxvii ltd preferred trust stock at a price of

factors considered in reaching this determination included the class or tranche held by the company  a  the current collateral position of the tranche  the projected cash flows as of december  and the credit rating of aaa 
management has the ability and intent to hold these securities to recovery  which may be maturity 
based upon these factors  management has determined these securities are not other than temporarily impaired 
as discussed above  loans receivable  excluding loans held for sale  totaled million at december   an increase of million from the million total at december  despite concerns in the real estate markets in general  there were strong increases in consumer loans for one to four family residential owner occupied property loans million  commercial real estate loans million  loans for land and developed building lots million and commercial purpose loans  most specifically loans to small businesses and local schools million originated during  reflecting the strength in being a community based financial institution 
construction lending dropped  a reflection of the depressed national construction market  as did consumer lending 
loan growth was funded partially by called and matured investments but primarily by increases in deposits for the period 
over the same period  interest receivable on interest earning assets decreased by  or  relecting the drop in interest rates resulting from the reductions of the prime rate by the federal reserve 
most radically affected by the drops in the prime interest rate were commercial loans and home equity lines of credit which change directly with the prime rate 
the average yield on loans at december  was  a decrease of from the rate of at december  river valley s consolidated allowance for loan losses totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the total allowance increased with only a slight change in the allowance as a percent of loans outstanding  
at december  as compared to 
for the same date in the loan growth experienced in should represent limited exposure to the allowance for loan losses due to the tightening of underwriting standards 
the risk due to growth in these economically challenging times was mitigated by selective underwriting of the borrower and collateral securing the debt 
for example  growth in commercial loans not secured by real estate was primarily due to one loan of million made to a school system 
growth in commercial real estate and land loans included a loan of million for a commercial complex in new albany  indiana with solid tenants of a medical nature  at an approximate loan to value of  a loan of million for an existing commerical strip  in a rapidly developing area  at an approximate loan to value of  a loan of million to a long time customer of the bank originated in the second quarter of and currently paid down to million  and a loan of million for commercial real estate in southern indiana at an approximate loan to value of 
the bank is conservative in its lending practices and does not originate the type of loans publicized as sub prime and therefore does not anticipate delinquencies other than those normally associated with the economic trends of the bank s market areas 
as of december  those trends remained stable despite national declines 
the expense for the provision for loan losses increased to million in  an increase of over the provision expense of  non performing loans defined as loans delinquent greater than days and loans on non accrual status totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  an increase of  with the exception of a few loans delinquent due to administrative delays in refinancing  the bank s non performing loans represent loans in the lengthy process of foreclosure  for which appropriate specific loss reserves have been established 
although management believes that its allowance for loan losses at december   is adequate based upon the available facts and circumstances  there can be no assurance that additions to such allowance will not be necessary in future periods  which could negatively affect the company s results of operations 
management is diligent in monitoring delinquent loans and in analyzing the factors affecting the allowance 
at december   the bank held three pieces of repossessed real estate valued at  as compared to two pieces with a combined value of  at december  borrowings totaled million at december  versus million on december  of total borrowings  million and million represent federal home loan bank fhlb advances with average rates of and at the respective dates 
the bank has experienced a slower drop in the overall cost of funds as a result of these longer term borrowing rates  which average slightly less than over the highest paying certificate of deposit rate for the bank 
shareholders equity totaled million at december   a slight decrease of million  or  from the million total at december  a significant factor in this decease was the repurchase of  shares of company stock in november from a shareholder at a purchase price of per share million 
other factors contributing to the change in shareholders equity included dividends paid during the period of million  a net change in the unrealized loss position on available for sale securities of 
million  and net income of million 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general river valley s net income for the year ended december   totaled million  an increase of  or  from net income of million reported for the same period in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to growth in interest earning assets  loans in particular  and improvement in the spread on interest bearing items  with net interest income increasing by year to year  and in non interest income  most specifically income from the gain on loan sales to the secondary market  which increased by over levels 
income tax expense decreased despite the overall increase in income  with a drop in the effective tax rate from in to in  a dollar drop of  income from municipal investments held at the company s nevada subsidiaries and increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance contributed to this drop in the effective tax rate 
net interest income total interest income for the year ended december   amounted to million  a slight decrease of  or  from the total 
the average balance of interest earning assets outstanding year to year increased by million  but due to the dramatic decreases in interest rates during  the yield on those assets decreased from an average yield of in to in interest income on loans totaled million for  a slight increase of approximately  or  from the million reported for interest income on investments  fhlb stock and interest earning deposits decreased by  or 
while drops in the yields on these assets had some effect  this decrease was primarily due to decreases in the average balances of these assets 
total interest expense for the period ended december  exhibited significant declines with a decrease of million  or  from million at december   to million at december  interest expense on deposits alone decreased by million  or  to a total of million for the year ended december  this was due to the interest rates decreases  despite strong deposit growth over the period 
repricing of certificates of deposits  and growth in those types of deposits  fueled the overall rate decrease 
the cost of deposits decreased from in to in fiscal interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of  from resulting primarily from the increased average balances in fhlb advances for the year 
as a result of the foregoing changes in interest income and interest expense  net interest income increased during by million  or  compared to the interest rate spread increased by basis points from in to in  while the net interest margin increased from in to at the end of provision for losses on loans a provision for losses on loans is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered appropriate by management based upon historical experience  the volume and type of lending conducted by the bank  the status of past due principal and interest payments  general economic conditions  particularly as such conditions relate to the primary market area  and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
as a result of such analysis  management recorded a million provision for losses on loans in  an increase of  or  compared to the  provision recorded in the current period provision generally reflects growth in the loan portfolio and management s analysis of the delinquency trends for the bank in view of the local real estate market and economy 
the increase in the provision year to year was predicated primarily on estimated losses with impact for the current local economic environment 
non performing loans for the period ended december  were million  a decrease of  or  from the million recorded as of fiscal year ended the decrease reflects the charge off of some long standing problem loans and aggressive management of past due accounts 
while management believes that the allowance for losses on loans is adequate at december   there can be no assurance that the loan loss allowance will be adequate to cover losses in the future 
management continues to be conservative in its underwriting  as discused above  in its classification of problem loans and in establishing realistic reserves for potential losses on loans 
as of december   the local economy remained relatively stable  as exhibited by employer activity and delinquency figures  despite grim national trends

as part of its effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  river valley financial is using the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its capital regulations 
presented on the following table is an analysis of river valley financial s interest rate risk  as of december  and december   as measured by changes in npv for an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift of through basis points in market interest rates 
generally  npv is more sensitive to rising rates than declining rates 
such difference in sensitivity occurs principally because  as rates rise  a bank s assets reprice slower than the deposits that fund them 
as a result  in a rising interest rate environment  the amount of interest a bank would receive on loans would increase as loans are slowly prepaid and new loans at higher rates are made 
moreover  the interest the bank would pay on deposits would increase  but generally slower than the bank s ability to reprice its interest earning assets 
however  river valley financial bank has addressed some of these issues  which has generally reduced its overall exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points estimated npv amount of change percent as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points estimated npv amount of change percent at december  and at december   the ots did not provide information as to interest rate risk for a point decrease 
as of december  they also did not provide information as to interest rate risk for a point decrease 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  loan and mortgage backed securities repayments  maturities of securities  borrowings and other funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan repayments and maturing investments are relatively predictable  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are more influenced by interest rates  general economic conditions and competition 
the company maintains investments in liquid assets based upon management s assessment of the need for funds  expected deposit flows  the yield available on short term liquid assets and the objectives of the asset liability management program 
the financial regulatory relief and economic efficiency act of  which was signed into law on december   repealed the former statutory requirement that all savings associations maintain an average daily balance of liquid assets in a minimum amount of not less than or more than of their withdrawable accounts plus short term borrowings 
the ots adopted a rule that implemented this revised statutory requirement  although savings associations remain subject to the ots regulation that requires them to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure their safe and sound operation 
at december   river valley financial bank had commitments to originate loans totaling million and in addition  had undisbursed loans in process  unused lines of credit and standby letters of credit totaling million 
at such date  river valley financial bank had million in commitments to sell loans and no outstanding commitment to purchase loans 
the company considers river valley financial bank s liquidity and capital resources sufficient to meet outstanding short and long term needs 
the company s liquidity  primarily represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a result of the funds provided by or used in the company s operating  investing and financing activities 
these activities are summarized below for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities purchase of securities proceeds from maturities of securities proceeds from sales of securities net loan originations other cash flows from financing activities net increase decrease in deposits net increase decrease in borrowings purchase of stock other net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents river valley financial is required by applicable law and regulation to meet certain minimum capital standards 
such capital standards include a tangible capital requirement  a core capital requirement  or leverage ratio  and a risk based capital requirement 
the tangible capital requirement requires savings associations to maintain tangible capital of not less than of the association s adjusted total assets 
tangible capital is defined in ots regulations as core capital minus intangible assets 
core capital is comprised of common shareholders equity including retained earnings  noncumulative preferred stock and related surplus  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual associations 
ots regulations require savings associations to maintain core capital generally equal to of the association s total assets except those associations with the highest examination rating and acceptable levels of risk 
ots regulations require that savings associations maintain risk based capital in an amount not less than of risk weighted assets 
risk based capital is defined as core capital plus certain additional items of capital  which in the case of river valley financial includes a general loan loss allowance of million at december  river valley financial exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements at december  the following table summarizes river valley financial s regulatory capital requirements and regulatory capital at december  ots requirement actual amount percent of assets amount percent of assets amount amount of excess dollars in thousands tangible capital core capital risk based capital tangible and core capital levels are shown as a percentage of total assets  risk based capital levels are shown as a percentage of risk weighted assets 
the ots has proposed and is expected to adopt a core capital requirement for savings associations comparable to that adopted by the office of the comptroller of the currency for national banks 
the regulation requires core capital of at least of total adjusted assets for savings associations that received the highest supervisory rating for safety and soundness  and to for all other savings associations 
river valley financial is in compliance with this requirement 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require river valley to measure financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars with the exception of investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale  which are carried at fair value 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the rate of inflation  they do not change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the rate of inflation 
rather  interest rate volatility is based on changes in the expected rate of inflation  as well as changes in monetary and fiscal policies
