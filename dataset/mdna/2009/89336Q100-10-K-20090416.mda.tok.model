we have also focused on creating a stronger value statement to our customers to drive additional traffic across the lease line and improve conversion 
this involves tailoring the overall square footage allocation in line with a store s trend  and increasing inventory and square footage allocations for growth categories 
as music sales have continued to decline  the company has been able to partially offset the impact by shifting square footage allocations from music to other product categories 
while adding inventory in other product categories  we remain focused on improving inventory turnover 
store openings and closures during fiscal and fiscal  the company closed and stores  respectively 
the company has not opened a new store in the last two years 
the company s real estate strategy is to reposition our store portfolio by reducing our store base to a core group of profitable locations 
the company closes stores when minimum operating thresholds are not achieved or upon lease expiration when either renewal is not available or management determines that renewal is not in the company s best interest 
the composition of these stores changes from time to time as the result of competitive changes and other factors 
expanding customer base to strengthen customer loyalty  the company offers its customers the option of signing up for a backstage pass card which provides an additional discount off of everyday selling prices on nearly all product in addition to other value added offers members receive through the program in exchange for an annual membership fee

during fiscal  cash used in investing activities consisted exclusively of capital expenditures of million

a that expires january credit facility 
the revolving credit facility contains provisions governing additional indebtedness and acquisitions and is secured by the company s eligible inventory  proceeds from the sale of inventory and by the stock of the company s subsidiaries

the recent distress in the financial markets has resulted in declines in consumer confidence and spending  extreme volatility in securities prices  diminished liquidity and credit availability 
if the national  or global  economies or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate further in the future  it is possible that such deterioration could put additional pressure on consumer spending and further negatively affect our cash flows 
although we have available borrowing capacity under our credit facility through january   tightening of the credit markets could also make it more difficult for us to enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of our securities 
the company s ability to obtain a new credit facility or other financing arrangements will depend upon future performance and financial condition  credit market conditions  and the availability of financing which  in turn  will be subject to general economic  financial  business  competitive legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the effects of these changes could also require us to make additional changes to our current plans and strategy 
additionally  although our levels of net cash provided by operating activities have been negatively affected by general economic conditions  we believe that our available cash and borrowing capacity under our credit facility  along with any positive cash flow generated from operations  will provide sufficient capital needed to fund our operations for the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to merchandise inventory and return costs  valuation of long lived assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  and accounting for gift card liability 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used by the company in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
management believes that of the company s significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity merchandise inventory and return costs merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market under the average cost method 
the average cost method attaches a cost to each item and is a blended average of the original purchase price and those of subsequent purchases or other cost adjustments throughout the life cycle of that item 
inventory valuation requires significant judgment and estimates  including obsolescence  shrink and any adjustments to market value  if market value is lower than cost 
inherent in the entertainment software industry is the risk of obsolete inventory 
typically  newer releases generate a higher product demand 
some vendors offer credits to reduce the cost of products that are selling more slowly  thus allowing for a reduction in the selling price and reducing the possibility for items to become obsolete 
the company records obsolescence and any adjustments to market value if lower than cost based on current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  and market conditions 
the provision for inventory shrink is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last date a physical inventory was performed to the end of the fiscal year 
such estimates are based on historical results and trends and the shrink results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least annually for all stores and distribution centers throughout the year and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
shrink expense  including obsolescence was million  million and million  in fiscal  and respectively 
as a rate to net sales  this equaled  and  respectively 
shrink expense  including obsolescence  as a percentage of net sales was higher in fiscal than in prior years due to higher shrink rates in our stores and the write down of obsolete inventory in the company s video game category 
presently  a change in the rate of shrink and obsolescence provision would equal approximately million in additional charge or benefit to cost of sales  based on fiscal net sales since the last physical inventories 
the company is generally entitled to return merchandise purchased from major vendors for credit against other purchases from these vendors 
certain vendors reduce the credit with a per unit merchandise return charge which varies depending on the type of merchandise being returned 
certain other vendors charge a handling fee based on units returned 
the company records merchandise return charges in cost of sales 
the company incurred merchandise return charges in its fiscal year  fiscal and fiscal of million  million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets to determine if any part of the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that the company considers to be important when assessing impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  if the company determines that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  it tests for impairment to determine if an impairment charge is needed 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million and million  respectively  related to the write down of certain long lived assets at underperforming locations 
there was no asset impairment charge recorded in fiscal losses for store closings in the ordinary course of business represent the write down of the net book value of abandoned fixtures and leasehold improvements 
the loss on disposal of fixed assets related to store closings was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  and is included in sg a expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and loss on disposal of fixed assets in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
store closings usually occur at the expiration of the lease  at which time leasehold improvements  which constitute a majority of the assets  are fully depreciated 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax operating loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled

stock based compensation the company s adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  during fiscal required that it recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the vesting of share based instruments in the statement of operations 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires the company to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
the company calculates the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility the estimated stock price volatility was derived based upon the company s actual historic stock prices over the expected life of the options  which represents the company s best estimate of expected volatility 
expected option life the company s estimate of an expected option life was calculated based on actual historical data relating to grants  exercises and cancellations 
risk free interest rate the company used the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected life assumption as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
the company reviewed historical forfeiture data and determined the appropriate forfeiture rate based on that data 
the company will re evaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  the company will recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest 
accounting for gift card liability the company sells gift cards that are redeemable only for merchandise and have no expiration date 
the company derecognizes card liability when either customers redeem cards  at which point the company records revenue  or when the company determines it does not have a legal obligation to remit unredeemed cards to the relevant jurisdictions and the likelihood of the cards being redeemed becomes remote  at which point the company records breakage as a credit to sg a expenses 
the company s accounting for gift cards is based on estimating the company s liability for future card redemptions at the end of a reporting period 
estimated liability is equal to two years of unredeemed cards  plus an amount for outstanding cards that may possibly be redeemed for the cumulative look back period  exclusive of the last two years 
the company s ability to reasonably and reliably estimate the liability is based on historical redemption experience with gift cards and similar types of arrangements and the existence of a large volume of relatively homogeneous transactions 
the company s estimate is not susceptible to significant external factors and the circumstances around gift card sales and redemptions have not changed significantly over time
