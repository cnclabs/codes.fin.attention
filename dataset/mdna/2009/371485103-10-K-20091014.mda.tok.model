part i item business 
corporate history and structure we were incorporated in delaware in september for the purpose of acquiring generex pharmaceuticals inc  a canadian corporation formed in november to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and development and other activities 
our acquisition of generex pharmaceuticals was completed in october in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of generex pharmaceuticals exchanged their shares for shares of our common stock 
in january  we participated in a reverse acquisition with green mt 
p 
s  inc  an inactive idaho corporation formed in as a result of this transaction  our shareholders the former shareholders of generex pharmaceuticals acquired a majority approximately of the outstanding capital stock of green mt  we became a wholly owned subsidiary of green mt  green mt 
changed its corporate name to generex biotechnology corporation generex idaho  and we changed our corporate name to gb delaware  inc because the reverse acquisition resulted in our shareholders becoming the majority holders of generex idaho  we were treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes 
thus  our historical financial statements  which essentially represented the historical financial statements of generex pharmaceuticals  were deemed to be the historical financial statements of generex idaho 
in april  we completed a reorganization in which we merged with generex idaho 
in this transaction  all outstanding shares of generex idaho were converted into our shares  generex idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity  and we changed our corporate name back to generex biotechnology corporation 
this reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting 
subsidiaries following our reorganization in  generex pharmaceuticals inc  which is incorporated in ontario  canada  remained as our wholly owned subsidiary 
all of our canadian operations are performed by generex pharmaceuticals 
in august  we acquired antigen express  inc antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
we formed generex bermuda  inc  which is organized in bermuda  in january in connection with a joint venture with elan international services  ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of elan corporation  plc  to pursue the application of certain of our and elan s drug delivery technologies  including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products 
in december  we and elan agreed to terminate the joint venture 
under the termination agreement  we retained all of our intellectual property rights and obtained full ownership of generex bermuda 
generex bermuda currently does not conduct any business activities 
we formed generex pharmaceuticals usa llc  which is organized in north carolina  usa  in february as a wholly owned subsidiary 
generex pharmaceuticals usa llc has not yet commenced any business operations 
we formed generex marketing distribution inc  which is organized in ontario  canada  in september generex marketing distribution inc has not yet commenced any business operations 
we formed generex biotechnology baltic  a limited liability company  in the republic of latvia in june generex biotechnology baltic has not yet commenced any business operations 
although not a separate legal entity  we have established a branch office in the exclusive dubai healthcare city operating as generex biotechnology corporation mena middle east and north africa to enable us to work closely with the regulatory and marketing personnel of leosons general trading company  our licensee in the region 
overview of business we are engaged primarily in the research  development and commercialization of drug delivery systems and technologies 
our primary focus at the present time is our proprietary technology for the administration of formulations of large molecule drugs to the oral buccal cavity using a hand held aerosol applicator 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  antigen  we have expanded our focus to include immunomedicines incorporating proprietary vaccine formulations 
we believe that our buccal delivery technology is a platform technology that has application to many large molecule drugs and provides a convenient  non invasive  accurate and cost effective way to administer such drugs 
we have identified several large molecule drugs as possible candidates for development  including estrogen  heparin  monoclonal antibodies  human growth hormone and fertility hormone  but to date have focused our development efforts primarily on one pharmaceutical product  generex oral lyn  an insulin formulation administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using our proprietary hand held aerosol spray applicator known as rapidmist 
to date  we have received regulatory approval in ecuador  india  lebanon and algeria for the commercial marketing and sale of generex oral lyn 
in march  we initiated phase iii clinical trials for this product in the us with the first patient screening for such trials at a clinical study site in texas 
the patient screening at other participating clinical sites in the us and canada is ongoing 
currently over patients have been enrolled in clinical sites around the world  including sites in the united states  canada  bulgaria  poland  romania  russia and ukraine 
we received a special access program sap authorization from health canada for a patient specific  physician supervised treatment of type diabetes with generex oral lyn in april sap provides access to non marketed drugs for practitioners treating patients with serious or life threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed  are not available or unsuitable 
we received a similar authorization from health authorities in netherlands in september over the past few months  we have initiated the process with the fda to allow for the availability of generex oral lyn for compassionate use in the united states on an individual patient basis single patient ind  as well as in a cohort of patients based on a treatment ind protocol 
upon fda approval  this compassionate use program would allow diabetes patients who do not otherwise qualify to participate in a clinical trial or who have no other satisfactory alternative treatment for diabetes  to have access to generex oral lyn 
we will continue to expand our sap participation in additional countries around the world 
in november we  together with our marketing partner shreya life sciences pvt 
ltd  officially launched generex oral lyn in india under marketing name of oral recosulin 
each package of oral recosulin contains two canisters of our product along with one actuator 
product has been available for sale in india since january  and an estimated dialectologists are currently prescribing oral recosulin there 
in november  we submitted our product dossier to the ministry of health in damascus  syria through generex mena  our branch office in dubai 
the dossier includes generex oral lyn 
we also submitted a file to register our proprietary over the counter products  including glucose rapidspray  day diet aid spray marketed as crave nx in the united states and canada and baboom energy spray 
the syrian ministry of health will review the dossier and inform us of any additional requests for information that it may have 
there have been no immediate queries  and we anticipate registration before the end of calendar year it is estimated that among syria s population of million  between million and million people have diabetes 
in december  we submitted generex oral lyn dossier to the ministry of health in iraq north through generex mena  our branch office in dubai and expect to receive an approval to market the product early in in december  we  together with our marketing partner benta sa  received an approval to market generex oral lyn in lebanon 
benta is currently working on reimbursement policy for generex oral lyn 
the official product launch in lebanon took place in may in may  the algerian health authorities granted us permission to import and sell generex oral lyn for the treatment of diabetes in algeria 
we expect commercial launch of the product by the end of calendar year through the efforts of our business development team  in association with our generex mena office  we have entered into a marketing sub distribution relationship with algerian company continental pharm laboratoire 
using our buccal delivery technology  we also have launched a line of over the counter glucose and energy sprays  including glucose rapidspray  crave nx day diet aid spray  and baboom energy spray 
we believe these products will complement generex oral lyn and may provide us with an additional revenue stream prior to the commercialization of generex oral lyn in other major jurisdictions 
in fiscal  we received modest revenues from sales of our commercially available products  our confectionary  glucose rapidspray  a flavored glucose energy spray supplemented with vitamins  baboom energy spray  and a fat free glucose spray to aid in dieting  crave nx 
all three products are available in retail stores and independent pharmacies in the united states and canada 
in addition  the products are being distributed in the middle east through our generex mena office in dubai 
we expect other distribution territories for these products to include south africa  india  south america and other jurisdictions worldwide 
we are currently pursuing european registrations for these products 
in october  we announced the enrollment of subjects in our bioequivalence clinical trial of metcontrol  our proprietary metformin medicinal chewing gum product 
the protocol for the study is an open label  two treatment  two period  randomized  crossover study comparing metcontrol and immediate release metformin tablets in healthy volunteers 
the study results  that we received and analyzed in december demonstrated bioequivalence and will allow us to proceed with additional research and development initiatives and consider regulatory agency registration applications 
our subsidiary  antigen express  concentrates on developing proprietary vaccine formulations that work by stimulating the immune system to either attack offending agents ie  cancer cells  bacteria  and viruses or to stop attacking benign elements ie  self proteins and allergens 
our immunomedicine products are based on two platform technologies and are in the early stages of development 
we continue clinical development of antigen s synthetic peptide vaccines designed to stimulate a potent and specific immune response against tumors expressing the her neu oncogene for patients with her neu positive breast cancer in a phase ii clinical trial and patients with prostate cancer and against avian influenza in two phase i trials 
an additional phase i trial has been initiated recently in patients with either breast or ovarian cancer 
the synthetic vaccine technology has particularly advantages for pandemic or potentially pandemic viruses  such as the hn avian and hn swine flu 
in addition to pandemic influenza viruses  development efforts also are underway for seasonal influenza virus  hiv  hpv  melanoma  ovarian cancer  allergy and type i diabetes mellitus 
we have established collaborations with clinical investigators at academic centers to advance these technologies 
we face competition from other providers of alternate forms of insulin 
some of our most significant competitors  pfizer  eli lilly  and novo nordisk  have announced that they will discontinue development and or sale of their inhalable forms of insulin 
generex oral lyn is not an inhaled insulin  rather  it is a buccally absorbed formulation with no residual pulmonary deposition 
we believe that our buccal delivery technology offers several advantages over inhaled insulin  including the avoidance of pulmonary inhalation  which requires frequent physician monitoring  ease of use and portability 
we are a development stage company 
from inception through the end of the year ended july   we have received only limited revenues from operations 
in the fiscal years ended july  and  we received approximately  and  in revenue 
the revenue in fiscal included  relating to an upfront license fee for the signing of a license and distribution agreement for generex oral lyn  while the remainder of the revenue in both fiscal periods pertained to the sale of our confectionary products 
these numbers do not reflect deferred sales to customers during the respective periods with the right of return 
we operate in only one segment the research  development and commercialization of drug delivery systems and technologies for metabolic and immunological diseases 
our business strategy our goal is to develop and commercialize our buccal delivery technology to administer large molecule drugs  including insulin  and proprietary vaccine formulations based upon two antigen platform technologies to provide innovative biopharmaceutical products that offer the potential for superior efficacy and safety over existing products 
to achieve these goals  the key elements of our strategy include conducting and completing phase iii clinical trials of generex oral lyn in the united states and canada  europe and certain countries in eastern europe including russia  ukraine  bulgaria and romania  commercializing generex oral lyn in ecuador  india  lebanon and algeria  the countries where we have obtained regulatory approval for its commercial marketing and sale  by undertaking additional commercial manufacturing runs of generex oral lyn at pharmabrand  sa s facilities in quito  ecuador and catalent pharma solutions in north carolina and expanding such production facilities to meet the anticipated demand for the product in india  lebanon  algeria and other jurisdictions where governmental approvals are pending and pursuing post approval clinical studies and marketing efforts in india  lebanon and algeria 
expanding the patient base in canada wherein generex oral lyn is available under the special access program sap authorization from health canada for a patient specific  physician supervised treatment of type diabetes  as well as in the united states under the fda s compassionate use program 
establishing strategic relationships worldwide for product development and distribution and working with our multinational licensed distributors in the middle east and throughout eastern europe  africa and asia to obtain regulatory approval for the registration  importation  marketing  distribution and sale of generex oral lyn in those countries 
conducting and completing phase ii clinical trials of antigen s synthetic peptide vaccines designed to stimulate a potent and specific immune response against tumors expressing the her neu oncogene for patients with her neu positive breast cancer  a phase i prostate cancer trial and a phase i trial in patients with breast or ovarian cancer  and conducting and completing a phase i clinical trial of antigen s synthetic peptide vaccines against avian hn influenza 
buccal delivery technology and products our buccal delivery technology involves the preparation of proprietary formulations in which an active pharmaceutical agent is placed in a solution with a combination of absorption enhancers and other excipients classified generally recognized as safe gras by the united states food and drug administration the fda when used in accordance with specified quantities and other limitations 
the resulting formulations are aerosolized with a pharmaceutical grade chemical propellant and are administered to patients using our proprietary rapidmist brand metered dose inhaler 
the device is a small  lightweight  hand held  easy to use aerosol applicator comprised of a container for the formulation  a metered dose valve  an actuator and dust cap 
using the device  patients self administer the formulations by spraying them into the mouth 
the device contains multiple applications  the number being dependent  among other things  on the concentration of the formulation 
absorption of the pharmaceutical agent occurs in the buccal cavity  principally through the inner cheek walls 
in clinical studies of our flagship oral insulin product generex oral lyn  insulin absorption in the buccal cavity has been shown to be very efficacious and safe 
buccal insulin product generex oral lyn insulin is a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas to regulate the level of glucose  a type of sugar  in the bloodstream 
the term diabetes refers to a group of disorders that are characterized by the inability of the body to properly regulate blood glucose levels 
when glucose is abundant  it is converted into fat and stored for use when food is not available 
when glucose is not available from food  these fats are broken down into free fatty acids that stimulate glucose production 
insulin acts by stimulating the use of glucose as fuel and by inhibiting the production of glucose 
in a healthy individual  a balance is maintained between insulin secretion and glucose metabolism 
there are two major types of diabetes 
type diabetes juvenile onset diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes refers to the condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin 
type diabetes accounts for percent of diabetes cases 
it often occurs in children and young adults 
type diabetics must take daily insulin injections  typically three to five times per day  to regulate blood glucose levels 
in type diabetes adult onset or non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus  the body does not produce enough insulin  or cannot properly use the insulin produced 
type diabetes is the most common form of the disease and accounts for percent of diabetes cases 
in addition to insulin therapy  type diabetics may take oral drugs that stimulate the production of insulin by the pancreas or that help the body to more effectively use insulin 
current studies in diabetes have identified a new condition closely related to diabetes  called impaired glucose tolerance igt 
people with igt do not usually meet the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus 
they have normal fasting glucose levels but two hours after a meal their blood glucose level is far above normal 
with the increase use of glucose tolerance tests the number of people diagnosed with this pre diabetic condition is expanding exponentially 
per the diabetes atlas  published by the international diabetes federation idf in  over million people in the united states and over million people world wide suffer from igt 
if not treated  diabetes can lead to blindness  kidney disease  nerve disease  amputations  heart disease and stroke 
each year  between  and  people suffer vision impairment or complete blindness because of diabetes 
diabetes is also the leading cause of end stage renal disease kidney failure  accounting for about percent of new cases 
in addition  about percent of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of diabetic nerve damage  which  in severe forms  can lead to lower limb amputations 
diabetics are also two to four times more likely to have heart disease  which is present in percent of diabetes related deaths  and are two to four times more likely to suffer a stroke 
there is no known cure for diabetes 
the idf estimates that there are currently almost million diabetics worldwide per their diabetes atlas and is expected to affect million people by the year there are estimated to be almost million people suffering from diabetes in north america alone and diabetes is the second largest cause of death by disease in north america 
a substantial number of large molecule drugs ie  drugs composed of molecules with a higher than specified molecular weight have been approved for sale in the united states or are presently undergoing clinical trials as part of the process to obtain such approval  including various proteins  peptides  monoclonal antibodies  hormones and vaccines 
unlike small molecule drugs  which generally can be administered by various methods  large molecule drugs historically have been administered predominately by injection 
the principal reasons for this have been the vulnerability of large molecule drugs to digestion and the relatively large size of the molecule itself  which makes absorption into the blood stream through the skin inefficient or ineffective 
we conducted the first clinical trials of our buccal insulin formulation with human subjects in ecuador in january we ultimately conducted a total of approximately studies in ecuador and an additional trials in other countries including the united states  canada  italy and israel over the period from to the principal purpose of these studies was to evaluate the effectiveness of our oral insulin formulation in humans as well as to show safety and efficacy of our product compared with injected insulin and placebos 
in march  we entered into a letter of intent for the establishment of a joint venture with pharmabrand sa  a distributor of pharmaceutical products in central and latin america 
in august  we sought approval for the manufacturing  marketing  distribution and sale of generex oral lyn and the rapidmist diabetes management system from the ecuadorian ministry of public health 
in may  we received approval from the ecuadorian ministry of public health for the commercial marketing and sale of generex oral lyn for treatment of type and type diabetes 
we have successfully completed of the delivery and installation of a turnkey generex oral lyn filling operation at the facilities of pharmabrand in quito  ecuador 
the first commercial production run of generex oral lyn in ecuador was completed in may  on the basis of the test results in ecuador and other pre clinical data  we made an investigatory new drug ind submission to the health protection branch in canada canada s equivalent to the fda in july  and received permission from the canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in september we filed an investigational new drug application with the fda in october  and received fda approval to proceed with human trials in november annual reports have been filed with the fda each year since that time 
we began our clinical trial programs in canada and the united states in january between january and september  we conducted clinical trials of our insulin formulation involving approximately type and type diabetic patients and healthy volunteers 
the study protocols in most trials involved administration of two different doses of our insulin formulation following either a liquid sustacal meal or a standard meal challenge 
the objective of these studies was to evaluate our insulin formulation s efficacy in controlling post prandial meal related glucose levels 
these trials demonstrated that our insulin formulation controlled post prandial hyperglycemia in a manner comparable to injected insulin 
in april  a phase ii b clinical trial protocol was approved in canada 
in september  a clinical trial application relating to our generex oral lyn protocol for late stage trials was approved by health canada 
the fda s review period for the protocol lapsed without objection in july in late march  we initiated phase iii clinical trials in north america for generex oral lyn with the first patient screening in texas 
other clinical sites participating in the study are located in the united states texas  maryland  minnesota and california  canada alberta  europe and eastern europe  including russia  ukraine  romania and bulgaria 
at present  over patients have been enrolled in the program in clinical sites around the world 
the phase iii protocol calls for a six month trial with a six month follow up with the primary objective to compare the efficacy of generex oral lyn and the rapidmist diabetes management system with that of standard regular injectable human insulin therapy as measured by hbac  in patients with type diabetes mellitus 
we expect to use the data collected from these trials in the new drug submission nds that will be prepared concurrently with the progression of the late stage trials for health canada  european union emea and the fda 
after an interim analysis of the data is conducted  we will determine whether we have reached statistical significance to file an nds with health canada  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom and the fda and if so  we will cut off enrollment in the phase iii clinical trials 
we have engaged a global clinical research organization to provide many study related site services  including initiation  communication with sites and documentation  a global central lab service company that will arrange for the logistics of kits and blood samples shipment and an internet based clinical data management company to assist us with global project management of the phase iii clinical trial and regulatory processes 
we have contracted with our third party manufacturers for sufficient quantities of the rapidmist brand metered dose inhaler components  the insulin  and the formulary excipients that will be required for the production of clinical trial batches of generex oral lyn 
as described above  we have obtained regulatory approval for the commercial marketing and sale of generex oral lyn in ecuador  india  lebanon and algeria 
buccal glucose and energy products glucose rapidspray  baboom energy spray and crave nx using our proprietary buccal delivery technology  we have developed several formulations of glucose sprays that are available over the counter 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we introduced  glucose rapidspray 
this product uses our proprietary rapidmist brand metered dose inhaler platform technology to provide an alternative for people who require or want additional glucose in their diet and delivers a fat free  low calorie glucose formulation directly into the mouth 
glucose rapidspray is currently available in the united states and canada through a number of leading retail chains  wholesalers and online 
it is also available wholesale in the middle east through generex mena 
we are currently pursuing european registrations for these products 
we plan to expand to the south african  baltic  nordic and other markets in glucose rapidspray offers another aid to diabetics who require or need additional glucose to their diets or daily intake 
recent studies conducted by scientists at the university campus bio medico  rome  italy in conjunction with generex have demonstrated that glucose rapidspray used early in the onset of a hypoglycemia episode can stop such an episode and prevent a further drop in blood glucose and the noxious feelings that ensue 
with our easy to use rapidspray bottle  individuals can easily add additional glucose to their diets and serves as a medium for first signs of low blood sugar levels 
we also conducted a clinical trial at department of endocrinology  children city hospital in moscow  russia on children up to years of age with type diabetes 
the study concluded that because of the small dose of glucose and control over the amount  glucose rapidspray represents superior tool in very young patients to control blood sugar levels relative to existing glucose products available on the market which can also improve the overall metabolic control 
we believe that we can market glucose rapidspray as a complementary product to generex oral lyn 
we believe that a combination therapy of generex oral lyn  glucose rapidspray and other oral agents  including a metformin gum which we are jointly developing with fertin pharma a s  could provide a full range of products used in the treatment of type diabetes and people with impaired glucose tolerance 
in fiscal year  we expanded our line of over the counter products using our proprietary rapidspray delivery device with the introduction of two additional products  crave nx and baboom 
crave nx is a fat free glucose spray that is marketed as an aid for dieters and can be used between meals as part of a daily diet routine  during exercise and before bedtime 
crave nx is the first product related to weight loss that we have launched 
a separate study conducted by scientists at the university campus bio medico  rome  italy had demonstrated that delivery of small amounts of glucose during the day appeared to reduce the body mass index of subjects using crave nx as compared to a control group 
such a benefit may be of benefit individuals with obesity and diabetes 
it is estimated that there are over million dieters in the united states  the majority of whom try to lose weight by themselves 
baboom energy spray is a convenient and pleasant tasting instant energy spray designed to enhance energy levels for sports  work  study  travel and overall fatigue 
its primary ingredients include glucose  caffeine  ginseng and vitamins b and c 
it is fat free  has fewer than five calories per serving and is available in watermelon flavor 
baboom energy spray is our first energy product 
currently  baboom energy spray and crave nx are being considered for commercial sale in several of the largest national and regional retailers and drug store chains in the united states and canada 
glucose rapidspray is currently being marketed in the middle east through the generex mena office in dubai and in south africa and six neighboring countries through the master distributor agreement with adcock ingram limited and adcock ingram healthcare pty ltd 
we expect to expand to other markets in fiscal the strategy to develop and launch these over the counter confectionary products is threefold 
the first is to demonstrate the expansion of our proprietary rapidspray technology 
the second is to create a brand name in the marketplace particularly in the diabetes shelf space with glucose rapidspray and crave nx and on a mainstream scale with baboom energy spray 
finally  the product pipeline is expected to provide us with an additional revenue stream while we attain registrations and approvals worldwide for our oral insulin product 
while the company focuses on increasing the sales for each of these products  other related products will be developed to serve as pipeline products and future sources of incremental revenue 
metformin gum product strategic alliance in may  we established a collaborative alliance with fertin pharma a s  a leading danish manufacturer of medicinal chewing gum  for the development of a metformin medicinal chewing gum for the treatment of type diabetes mellitus and obesity 
metformin is a generic drug used to regulate blood glucose levels by reducing the amount of glucose produced by the liver  reducing the amount of glucose absorbed from food in the stomach  and by making the insulin produced by the body work more effectively to reduce the amount of glucose already in the blood 
it is an important staple of the standard of care for patients with type diabetes mellitus 
through this collaborative relationship  we will seek to combine our proprietary buccal drug delivery platform technologies with fertin s know how related to gum base formulations  solubilization systems  and taste masking modification to create a metformin medicinal chewing gum that will deliver metformin into the body via the buccal mucosa rather than in its current tablet form 
we anticipate that this delivery method  in addition to being much more rapid and providing a much more specific and effective dosing regimen  could avoid some of the adverse side effects associated with taking metformin in tablet form  such as nausea  vomiting  abdominal pain  diarrhea  abdominal bloating  and increased gas production 
in addition  metformin gum could avoid the bitter taste and large doses associated with the tablet form and thus improve therapeutic compliance  particularly among younger patients 
fertin produced clinical materials for a bioequivalence study of our proprietary metformin chewing gum  metcontrol  which was completed in late in the study  we compared the single dose blood level profile of metformin to that of immediate release metformin tablets 
we anticipate that formal abbreviated new drug application with full support data will be prepared and submitted to health authorities in north america  europe and other global regions in the first half of  where we will be seeking regulatory approval for the sale of the product 
if we successfully develop the metformin medicinal chewing gum  we plan to market it as a companion product to generex oral lyn 
we believe that a combination therapy of generex oral lyn  metformin gum  and other traditional oral agents could optimize the treatment of type diabetes and  possibly  delay the onset of certain complications associated with diabetes 
the company s intended strategy is to either contract a marketing partner to market and distribute the product in major markets world wide or to license the product for sale by a third party 
potential buccal morphine and fentanyl products the delivery of morphine and fentanyl by oral formulation pills and injection for the treatment of moderate to severe breakthrough and postoperative pain often fails to provide patients with adequate relief and control because  among other reasons  breakthrough and postoperative pain are characterized as being moderate to severe in intensity and have a rapid onset of action and a short to medium duration 
not only does delivery by pills have a slow onset of action  it is often difficult for patients to adjust their doses  with the result that patients are either over or under medicated 
injections are invasive and require an attendant to administer the medication which reduces the patient s control over the pain and may cause increased anxiety 
we believe that a buccal delivery formulation for morphine and fentanyl would have a critical series of attributes well suited for the treatment of breakthrough and post operative pain  would be cost effective and would have a demonstrable improvement over current delivery methods  including fast access to the circulatory system  precise dosing control and a simple  self administration procedure 
we made an investigatory new drug submission for buccal morphine to the health protection branch in canada in january  and received permission from the canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in march we made an investigatory new drug submission for fentanyl to the health protection branch in canada in august  and received permission from the canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in october during the fiscal year ended july   we did not actively pursue our buccal morphine and buccal fentanyl projects 
the development of these products will most likely be delayed while we focus on late stage trials of the oral insulin formulation in the united states  canada and europe 
other potential buccal products we have had discussions of possible research collaborations with various pharmaceutical companies concerning use of our large molecule drug delivery technology with other compounds  including monoclonal antibodies  human growth hormone  fertility hormone  estrogen and heparin  and a number of vaccines 
we have not aggressively pursued development opportunities apart from insulin because we believe it is more advantageous to concentrate our resources  particularly our financial resources  on commercializing the insulin product 
immunomedicine technology and products our wholly owned subsidiary antigen express is developing proprietary vaccine formulations based upon two platform technologies that were discovered by its founder  the ii key hybrid peptides and ii suppression 
these technologies are applicable for either antigen specific immune stimulation or suppression  depending upon the dosing and formulation of its products 
using active stimulation  we are focusing on major diseases such as breast and prostate cancer  influenza including hn avian and hn swine flu and hiv 
autoimmune disease such as diabetes  multiple sclerosis and allergic asthma are the focus of our antigen specific immune suppression work 
antigen s immunotherapeutic vaccine ae is currently in phase ii clinical trials for patients with her neu positive breast cancer 
the trial is being conducted with the united states military cancer institute s usmci clinical trials group and will examine the rate of relapse in patients with node positive or high risk node negative breast cancer after two years 
the study is randomized and will compare patients treated with ae plus the adjuvant gm csf versus gm csf alone 
the phase ii trial follows a phase i trial that demonstrated safety  tolerability  and immune stimulation of the ae vaccine in breast cancer patients 
based on positive results in trials of the ae vaccine in breast cancer patients  we entered into an agreement in august with the euroclinic  a private center in athens  greece  to commence clinical trials with the same compound as an immunotherapeutic vaccine for prostate cancer 
a phase i trial involving patients has been completed recently  which similarly showed safety  tolerability and induction of an immune response 
agreements are in place for initiation of a phase ii clinical trial 
the same technology used to enhance immunogenicity is being applied in the development of a synthetic peptide vaccine for hn avian influenza 
in april  a phase i clinical trial of antigen s proprietary peptides derived from the hemagglutinin protein of the hn avian influenza virus was initiated in healthy volunteers in the lebanese canadian hospital in beirut  lebanon 
we have completed the first portion of the phase i trial 
modified peptide vaccines for avian influenza offer several advantages over traditional egg based or cell culture based vaccines 
modified peptide vaccines can be manufactured by an entirely synthetic process which reduces cost and increases both the speed and quantity of vaccine relative to egg or cell culture based vaccines 
another advantage is that the peptides are derived from regions of the virus that are similar enough in all hn virus strains such that they would not have to be newly designed for the specific strain to emerge in a pandemic 
in march  antigen entered into an agreement with beijing daopei hospital in beijing  china to conduct clinical trials using antigen s pioneering technology for rna interference rnai stimulation of the immune response against patients immune cells 
the strategy developed by antigen involves modifying the patient s cancer cells to increase their immunogenicity and thereby enable the immune system to fight off the cancer anywhere in the patient s body 
antigen has developed proprietary methods using rnai to specifically inhibit expression of the ii protein in cancer cells already expressing mhc class ii molecules that are amenable to clinical use 
cancer cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia will be transfected with a vector expressing rnai to silence ii expression 
after lethal irradiation  the cells are re introduced as a subcutaneous immunization to the patient 
preliminary work under the agreement has commenced 
due to regulatory changes in china s approval process relating to these types of studies  it is unclear when the trial might commence 
we have filed a physician s investigational new drug application for the phase i and phase ii trials in patients with stage ii her neu positive breast cancer 
a physician s investigational new drug application for phase i trial in patients with breast or ovarian cancer also has been filed 
applications were filed and approvals obtained for phase i prostate cancer using ae in athens  greece from the hellenic organization of drugs 
the ministry of health in lebanon gave approval for phase i trial of our experimental hn prophylactic vaccine in beirut  lebanon following submission of an application 
all other immunomedicine products are in the pre clinical stage of development 
government regulation our research and development activities and the manufacturing and marketing of our pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the united states  health protection branch in canada and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries 
among other things  extensive regulation puts a burden on our ability to bring products to market 
while these regulations apply to all competitors in our industry  many of our competitors have more experience in dealing with the fda and other regulators 
also  other companies in our industry are not limited primarily to products which still need to be approved by government regulators  as we are now 
if requisite regulatory approvals are not obtained and maintained  our business will be substantially harmed 
in many cases  we expect that extant and prospective development partners will participate in the regulatory approval process 
the following discussion summarizes the principal features of food and drug regulation in the united states and other countries as they affect our business 
united states all aspects of our research  development and foreseeable commercial activities relating to pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states 
united states federal and state statutes and regulations govern  among other things  the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the regulatory approval process  including clinical trials  usually takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted  the approval may include significant limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed 
the steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the united states include quality test studies  pre clinical tests studies  submission to the fda of investigational new drug applications inds and or amendments for each planned human clinical trial  fda acceptance of inds  which permit human clinical trials to commence  commencement and completion of numerous human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the subject drug  submission of a new drug application to the fda  and fda approval of the new drug application  including approval of all product labeling 
quality and pre clinical tests and studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance and drug product chemistry  formulation manufacturing  and stability profiling  as well as a large number of animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product 
typically  the pre clinical studies consist of the following pharmacology primary and secondary pharmacodynamics safety pharmacology other pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics pk single and multiple dose kinetics tissue distribution metabolism pk drug interactions other pk studies toxicology single and multiple dose toxicity genotoxicity carcinogenicity reproduction toxicity other toxicity the results of the quality and pre clinical tests studies  in addition to any non clinical pharmacology  are submitted to the fda along with the initial clinical study protocol see descriptive of process below as part of the initial ind and are reviewed by the fda before the commencement of human clinical trials 
unless the fda objects to it  the ind becomes effective days following its receipt by the fda 
subsequent clinical studies may begin as soon as the protocols are submitted 
fda reviews all protocols  protocol amendments  adverse event reports  study reports  and annual reports in connection with a new pharmacological product 
the ind for our oral insulin formulation became effective in november amendments are also subsequently filed as new clinical studies and their corresponding study protocols are proposed 
in july  we received a no objection clearance to initiate our phase iii study protocol for our oral insulin product 
we filed an investigational new drug application for buccal morphine in january the physician s investigational new drug application for the phase and phase ii trial of ae  antigen s synthetic peptide vaccine designed to stimulate a potent and specific immune response against tumors expressing the her neu oncogene  in patients with stage ii her neu positive breast cancer became effective in march clinical trials involve the administration of a new drug to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators 
the protocols for the trials must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
also  each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board irb  which considers  among other things  ethical factors  the safety of human subjects  and the possible liability of the institution conducting the clinical trials 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases phase i  phase ii  and phase iii  but the phases may overlap 
phase i clinical trials test the drug on healthy human subjects for safety and other aspects  but not effectiveness 
phase ii clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the drug for specific purposes  to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosages  and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
when a compound has shown evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety in phase ii evaluations  phase iii clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at clinical trial sites in different geographical locations 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that the safety and efficacy of therapeutic product candidates be supported through at least two adequate and well controlled phase iii clinical trials known as pivotal trials 
the successful completion of phase iii clinical trials is a mandatory step in the approval process for the manufacturing  marketing  and sale of products 
in the united states  the results of quality  pre clinical studies and clinical trials  if successful  are submitted to the fda in a new drug application nda to seek approval to market and commercialize the drug product for a specified use 
the nda is far more specific than the ind and must also include proposed labeling and detailed technical sections based on the data collected 
the fda has months to take an action for a standard application and shorter for a priority application 
it may deny a nda if it believes that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied 
the fda also may require additional testing for safety and efficacy of the drug 
we cannot be sure that any of our proposed products will receive fda approval 
the multi tiered approval process means that our products could fail to advance to subsequent steps without the requisite data  studies  and fda approval along the way 
even if approved by the fda  our products and the facilities used to manufacture our products will remain subject to review and periodic inspection by the fda 
to supply drug products for use in the united states  foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities must be registered with  and approved by  the fda 
manufacturing facilities must also comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmps  and such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda 
products manufactured outside the united states are inspected by regulatory authorities in those countries under agreements with the fda 
to comply with cgmps  manufacturers must expend substantial funds  time and effort in the area of production and quality control 
the fda stringently applies its regulatory standards for manufacturing 
discovery of previously unknown problems with respect to a product  manufacturer or facility may result in consequences with commercial significance 
these include restrictions on the product  manufacturer or facility  suspensions of regulatory approvals  operating restrictions  delays in obtaining new product approvals  withdrawals of the product from the market  product recalls  fines  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
one final hurdle that is closely associated with the cgmp inspections is the pre approval inspection that fda carries out prior to the issuance of a marketing license 
fda inspectors combine cgmp compliance with a review of research and development documents that were used in the formal new drug application 
a close inspection of historic data is reviewed to confirm data and to demonstrate that a company has carried out the activities as presented in the new drug application 
this is generally a long inspection and requires a team of individuals from the company to host the fda inspector s 
foreign countries before we are permitted to market any of our products outside of the united states  those products will be subject to regulatory approval by foreign government agencies similar to the fda 
these requirements vary widely from country to country 
generally  however  no action can be taken to market any drug product in a country until an appropriate application has been submitted by a sponsor and approved by the regulatory authorities in that country 
again  similar to the fda  each country will mandate a specific financial consideration for the marketing application dossiers being submitted 
although an important consideration  fda approval does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities 
the current approval process varies from country to country  and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for fda approval 
the canadian regulatory process is substantially similar to that of the united states 
to date  we have received the following foreign regulatory approval for our product candidates we obtained regulatory approval to begin clinical trials of our oral insulin formulation in canada in november in april  we received approval of an oral lyn phase ii b clinical trial protocol in canada 
in september health canada approved our clinical trial application in respect of our proposed generex oral lyn protocol for late stage trials  we expect to use the data collected from these trials in the new drug submission that will be prepared concurrently with the progression of the late stage trials 
we obtained regulatory approval in canada to begin clinical trials of our buccal morphine product in march and our fentanyl product in october in may  we received approval from the ecuadorian ministry of public health for the commercial marketing and sale of generex oral lyn for treatment of type and type diabetes 
in november  we obtained approval for the importation and commercial marketing and sale in india of generex oral lyn from the central drugs standard control organization cdsco  directorate general of health services  government of india  which is responsible for authorizing marketing approval of all new pharmaceutical products in india 
we received a special access program sap authorization from health canada for a patient specific  physician supervised treatment of type diabetes with generex oral lyn in april sap provides access to non marketed drugs for practitioners treating patients with serious or life threatening conditions when conventional therapies have failed  are not available or unsuitable 
we received a similar authorization from health authorities in netherlands in september applications were filed and approvals obtained in may for a phase i prostate cancer trial using ae in athens  greece from the hellenic organization of drugs 
the ministry of health in lebanon gave approval for the phase i trial of our experimental hn prophylactic vaccine in beirut  lebanon following submission of an application 
in december  we  together with our marketing partner benta sa  received an approval to market generex oral lyn in lebanon 
benta is currently working on reimbursement policy for generex oral lyn 
the official product launch in lebanon took place in may in may  the algerian health authorities granted us permission to import and sell generex oral lyn for the treatment of diabetes in algeria 
we expect commercial launch of the product by the end of calendar year through the efforts of our business development team  in association with the generex mena  we have entered into a marketing sub distribution relationship with algerian company continental pharm laboratoire 
in september  the us food and drug administration fda granted approval for the treatment use of generex oral lyn under the fda s treatment investigational new drug ind program 
the fda s treatment ind program allows us to provide early access to generex oral lyn for patients with serious or life threatening conditions for which there is no satisfactory alternative treatment 
marketing and distribution we market our products through collaborative arrangements with companies that have well established pharmaceutical marketing and distribution capabilities  including expertise in the regulatory approval processes in their respective jurisdictions 
generex oral lyn our business partner in ecuador  pharmabrand  has generated some commercial sales of generex oral lyn in that country since the product received regulatory approval in may currently  our relationship with pharmabrand is governed by a letter of intent  and we are in the process of refining our relationship with pharmabrand to transition its role to primarily that of a manufacturer for the commercial orders placed worldwide with distribution rights in ecuador 
we do not expect that such sales will be reflected in our financial statements until we have entered into a definitive agreement with pharmabrand or until such time that sales are considered material 
we have entered into licensing and distribution agreements with a number of multinational distributors to assist us with the process of gaining regulatory approval for the registration  marketing  distribution  and sale of generex oral lyn in countries throughout the world  including leosons general trading company  which holds the license under which the generex mena office operates middle eastern and north african countries  shreya life sciences pvt 
ltd 
india  pakistan  bangladesh  nepal  bhutan  sri lanka  and myanmar  adcock ingram limited and adcock ingram healthcare pty ltd

under these licensing and distribution agreements excluding the one with dong sung pharm co  we will not receive an upfront license fee  but the distributor will bear any and all costs associated with the procurement of governmental approvals for the sale of generex oral lyn  including any clinical and regulatory costs 
we possess the worldwide marketing rights to our oral insulin product 
in august  we entered into a product licensing and distribution agreement with dong sung pharm co 
ltd 
for the importation  marketing  distribution and sale of generex oral lyn in south korea 
under the seven year agreement  dong sung will have an exclusive license and will pay us a usd  non refundable license fee upon execution and a usd  non refundable license fee at such time as governmental approval for the importation  marketing  distribution and sale of the product in south korea is obtained 
under this agreement  we are responsible for procuring such governmental approval 
in addition  when it places its first purchase order  dong sung will pay us a pre payment in the amount of usd  which will be applied against product purchase orders 
previously  we entered into a licensing and distribution agreement with the armenian development agency and the canada armenia trading house ltd 
for the commercialization of generex oral lyn in the republic of armenia  georgia and the republic of kazakhstan 
although an application for registration has been submitted to public health authorities in armenia  to date no approval has been forthcoming 
we terminated this agreement in january  but we are continuing to prosecute the armenian application on our own through our generex mena branch office 
in december  we  together with our marketing partner benta sa  received an approval to market generex oral lyn in lebanon 
benta is currently working on reimbursement policy for generex oral lyn 
the official product launch in lebanon took place in may our generex mena office  located in dubai healthcare city  has filed submissions of the generex oral lyn dossier with regulatory agencies throughout the middle east and north africa and has established a distribution network in over countries 
this distribution network is responsible for following up with dossiers submitted in their specific regions  and has also been actively purchasing and distributing the company s confectionary line of products 
in march  we received the first commercial purchase order for the product from our distributor in india 
we have partially manufactured the product to fulfill this order at the pharmabrand facility in ecuador and partial shipment was made in september a marketing plan has already been submitted by shreya life sciences pvt 
ltd  to generex on the marketing strategy for the distribution of oral recosulin the trademark under which shreya will market generex oral lyn within india 
the marketing plan also includes post approval marketing studies 
we did not recognize any revenues from the sale of generex oral lyn in india in the fiscal year 
over the counter products we have entered into distribution agreements or have our products listed with a number of pharmaceutical wholesalers  including cardinal health  mckesson usa  amerisourcebergen corporation  dik drug co  hd smith wholesale drug  rochester drug company  smith drug company  value drug company  kohl frisch limited  unipharm wholesale drugs ltd and mckesson canada  for the distribution of glucose rapidspray  baboom energy spray and crave nx 
our products are available in a number of retail chains and outlets throughout the united states and canada  including rite aid  meijer  medicine shoppe  kinney drug  inc  kerr drug  inc wal mart canada  shoppers drugmart  rexall pharmaplus  loblaw companies ltd  and canada inc glucose rapidspray is also available for sale on the internet through amazon 
com  walgreens 
com  americandiabeteswholesale 
com and diabeticexpress 
com  as well as in a number of independent drugstores throughout north america 
we have entered into a distribution agreement with butler animal health supply llc  a usa leading distributor of companion animal health supplies to veterinarians  pursuant to which butler will distribute glucose rapidspray in the animal health industry in the united states 
we have also established relationships with brokers who serve as a liaison to retail outlets throughout the us and canada 
these brokers represent multiple products that are presented to specific product buyers 
we believe that our relationships with the brokers will place us in a stronger position to get our products listed and on the shelf in major chains throughout the united states and canada 
our over the counter glucose and energy spray products  baboom energy spray and crave nx  are being reviewed for commercial sale in several of the largest national and regional retailers and drug store chains in the united states and canada 
recently  we have begun limited direct marketing of our glucose sprays on the internet and have established web sites for each of glucose rapidspray  baboom energy spray and crave nx where consumers may purchase these products directly 
we continue to seek to expand our existing distribution channels for our over the counter confectionary products through our generex mena branch office and to date we have enlisted distributors in over twenty countries in the middle east and north africa to market the products on our behalf 
generex mena has also been pursuing distribution channels for the confectionary products outside of their immediate jurisdiction and has been successful in penetrating markets with these products in africa  eastern europe  and australia 
under these agreements  we will not receive an upfront license fee with respect to the confectionary products  but the respective distributor will bear all costs associated with the procurement of governmental approvals for the sale of the products  including any clinical and regulatory costs 
with respect to marketing all of our products  we intend to rely primarily on contracting or collaborative arrangements with other companies that possess strong pharmaceutical marketing and distribution resources to perform these functions for us 
accordingly  we may not have the same control over marketing and distribution that we would have if we conducted these functions ourselves 
manufacturing in december  we completed our pilot manufacturing facility for generex oral lyn in toronto  canada in the same commercial complex in which our laboratories are located 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  we initiated a scale up commercial production run of several thousand canisters of generex oral lyn at this facility 
we will need to significantly increase our manufacturing capability or engage contract manufacturers in order to manufacture any product in significant commercial quantities 
in march  we successfully completed the delivery and installation of a turnkey generex oral lyn filling operation at the facilities of pharmabrand  in quito  ecuador for the purposes of commercial supply and sales in ecuador and other countries that can procure registrations and import licenses 
we anticipate that the capacity of this facility will be sufficient to support commercial sales in ecuador and other countries in latin america 
in anticipation of undertaking late stage clinical trials of generex oral lyn in canada  we entered into an agreement with cardinal health pts  llc  now known as catalent pharma solutions catalent  in june  pursuant to which catalent will manufacture clinical trial batches of generex oral lyn 
pursuant to pre extant supply arrangements  our third party suppliers have been manufacturing the quantities of the rapidmist brand metered dose inhaler components valves  canisters  actuators  and dust caps  the insulin  and the formulary excipients that will be required for the catalent production 
in addition  our regulatory affairs  quality control and r d personnel have been working with catalent to prepare and validate the catalent production processes 
we are currently negotiating terms with catalent for production of commercial quantities of generex oral lyn 
our subsidiary antigen leases office and laboratory space in worcester  massachusetts  which is sufficient for its present needs 
the laboratory has permission to store and use biohazardous including recombinant dna materials and flammable chemicals 
our over the counter glucose and energy products are manufactured in the united states by team tech inc in tennessee and in canada they are manufactured by pax all manufacturing  inc  a contract manufacturing company with an emphasis on over the counter and personal care products at pax all s manufacturing facility located in mississauga  canada 
raw material supplies the excipients used in our formulation are available from numerous sources in sufficient quantities for clinical purposes  and we believe that they will be available in sufficient quantities for commercial purposes when required  although we have not yet attempted to secure a guaranteed commercial supply of any such products 
components suitable for our rapidmist brand metered dose inhaler are available from a limited number of potential suppliers  as is the chemical propellant used in the device 
the components which now comprise the device will be utilized with the commercial version of our insulin product in ecuador  india  lebanon and algeria  as well as the components for the commercial version of our new glucose spray and energy products in the united states and canada 
we have secured supply arrangements with manufacturers for each of the components and the propellant that we presently use in our rapidmist brand metered dose inhaler for commercial quantities of such components 
all such suppliers are prominent  reputable and reliable suppliers to the pharmaceutical industry 
because we now have a single supplier for each of these components and the propellant  however  we are more vulnerable to supply interruptions than would be the case if we had multiple suppliers for each component 
we do not believe that the risk of supply for proprietary raw materials or device components is unusual in the pharmaceutical industry 
insulin is available worldwide from only a few sources 
however  alternative supplies of insulin are under development 
we currently procure recombinant human insulin crystals for clinical trials and commercial production in ecuador from time to time from a european supplier whose production facility is gmp certified by the fda and european health authorities 
we are working towards the establishment of a guaranteed long term supply arrangement while also exploring potential alternative sources of supply 
we also believe future development and marketing partners under licensing and development agreements  if any  will provide  or assist us to obtain  pharmaceutical compounds that are used in products covered under such agreements 
components used in the production of our over the counter glucose sprays products  including glucose and all excipients  are available from a number of potential suppliers 
we have not secured commercial supply agreements with any of them as they are readily available in the commercial quantities 
while morphine is a controlled substance  it is readily available for use in clinical trials 
we currently have the appropriate licenses and facilities for acquiring and storing morphine in canada 
various regulatory issues surround the import of morphine into the united states  and we will need to address these issues prior to commencing clinical trials in the united states 
raw materials for our pre clinical development stage immunomedicine products include amino acids for peptide therapeutics and oligonucleotides for genetic constructs 
these materials are readily available from commercial suppliers 
we utilize the services of several commercial laboratories for the manufacturing of our pre clinical development stage immunomedicine products 
intellectual property we hold a number of patents in the united states and foreign countries covering our buccal and other delivery technologies 
we also have developed brand names and trademarks for products in all areas 
we consider the overall protection of our patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement 
patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceutical products 
protection for individual products or technologies extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries 
the protection afforded  which may also vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent  its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country 
we currently have twenty one issued us patents and four pending us patent applications pertaining to various aspects of drug delivery technology  including oral administration of macromolecular formulations such as insulin as well as pain relief medications such as morphine and fentanyl 
we currently hold eight issued canadian patents and five pending canadian patent applications also relating to various aspects of drug delivery technology 
we also hold one hundred and twenty eight issued patents and ninety six pending patent applications covering our drug delivery technology  including our over the counter glucose and energy spray products and metformin gum  in jurisdictions other than the us and canada  including japan  mexico  australia and several european countries 
we plan to continue to expand our patent portfolio for additional products  formulations and device inventions 
we also plan to expand the territorial coverage of our existing patent portfolio and new additions to more markets around the world where we plan to do business 
furthermore  we have an indirect interest in eighteen drug delivery patents held by another company  centrum biotechnologies  inc in addition to patents  we hold intellectual property in the form of trademark applications or registrations for generex biotechnology design  generex oral lyn  oral lyn  oral lyn  oralin  glucose rapidspray  metcontrol  rapidmist  glucobreak  nicobreak and baboom in various jurisdictions in the world 
we are also using  either by ourselves or through a licensee  the trademarks cravenx and oral recosulin in some jurisdictions 
no applications to register cravenx and oral recosulin have been made as of the date of writing this statement 
trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product  but are considered to have marketing value 
trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used  in other countries  as long as registered 
registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely 
our subsidiary antigen express currently holds nine issued us patents  three australian patents  twelve other foreign patents  five pending us patent applications  three pending us provisional patents and sixteen foreign patent applications concerning technology for modulating the immune system via activation of antigen specific helper t lymphocytes 
some of these patents are held under exclusive licenses from the university of massachusetts 
dr 
robert humphreys  a retired officer of antigen  is the listed inventor or co inventor on most of these patents and patent applications  including those licensed from the university of massachusetts 
we possess the worldwide manufacturing and marketing rights to our oral insulin product 
our long term success will substantially depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology and our ability to protect our technology from infringement  misappropriation  discovery and duplication 
we cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted  or that any patents which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position 
our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general  are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues 
we believe that our existing technology and the patents which we hold or for which we have applied do not infringe anyone else s patent rights 
we believe our patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies 
we cannot be sure of this  however  because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues 
see part i item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain legal proceedings involving intellectual property issues 
we also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information 
we seek to protect this information  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
competition we expect that products based upon our buccal delivery technology and any other products that we may develop will compete directly with products developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  government agencies and public and private research organizations 
products developed by our competitors may use a different active pharmaceutical agent or treatment to treat the same medical condition or indication as our product or may provide for the delivery of substantially the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products using different methods of administration 
for example  a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in various stages of research  development and testing of alternatives to insulin therapy for the treatment of diabetes  as well as new methods of delivering insulin 
these methods  including nasal  transdermal  needle free high pressure injection and pulmonary  may ultimately successfully deliver insulin to diabetic patients 
some biotechnology companies also have developed different technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific research and product development capabilities  as well as financial  marketing and human resources  than we do 
where the same or substantially the same active ingredient is available using alternative delivery means or the same or substantially the same result is achievable with a different treatment or technology  we expect that competition among products will be based  among other things  on product safety  efficacy  ease of use  availability  price  marketing and distribution 
when different active pharmaceutical ingredients are involved  these same competitive factors will apply to both the active agent and the delivery method 
we consider other drug delivery and biotechnology companies to be direct competitors for the cooperation and support of major drug and biotechnology companies that own or market proprietary pharmaceutical compounds and technologies  as well as for the ultimate patient market 
of primary concern to us are the competitor companies that are known to be developing delivery systems for insulin and other pharmaceutical agents that we have identified as product candidates and technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens 
the following descriptions of our competitors and their products were obtained from their filings with the securities and exchange commission  information available on their web sites and industry research reports 
buccal insulin product mannkind corporation s product candidates include afresa  a mealtime insulin therapy being studied for use in adult patients with type and type diabetes 
it is a drug device combination product which administers insulin through inhalation to the lungs 
mannkind submitted an nda to the fda requesting approval to market afresa in may nektar therapeutics and pfizer terminated their collaborative development and licensing agreement for exubera and nektar s next generation inhaled insulin product in november exubera was the first inhaled insulin formulation to receive fda approval 
in april  nektar announced that it had ceased all negotiations with potential partners for exubera and the next general inhaled insulin product as a result of new data analysis from ongoing clinical trials conducted by pfizer which indicated an increased risk of lung cancer in certain patients 
we are not aware of any product candidates under development by nektar that compete directly with oral lyn  nor are we aware of any product currently in pfizer s pipeline that directly competes with oral lyn 
novo nordisk a s  one of the two leading manufacturers of insulin in the world  announced in may the termination of clinical testing of the pulmonary delivery system for inhaled insulin  the aerx insulin diabetes management system aerx idms  initially developed by aradigm corporation 
the product was in phase iii clinical trials at the time of novo nordisk s announcement

in may  alkermes  amylin pharmaceuticals  inc and eli lilly and company submitted a new drug application nda for exenatide once weekly  an extended release injectable formulation  to the us food and drug administration fda 
the nda was accepted for review by the fda in july if approved  exenatide once weekly would be the first once a week therapy for the treatment of type diabetes 
cpex pharmaceuticals  inc s proprietary permeation enhancer  cpe  provides skin  mouth  nose and eye membrane absorption of a variety of pharmaceuticals 
cpex has applied this technology to nasulin  through which insulin is absorbed via nasal mucosa 
nasulin is currently in phase ii clinical trials 
bentley pharmaceuticals spun off its drug delivery business as cpex prior to bentley s merger with teva pharmaceuticals industries  ltd 
there are several companies that are working on developing products which involve the oral delivery of analogs of insulin 
oramed pharmaceuticals is developing an orally ingestible insulin capsule which is currently in phase ii clinical trials 
emisphere technologies  inc has done some research on oral insulin and completed phase ii clinical trials in  however they have announced that they will not currently focus their development resources on oral insulin  but will instead focus their diabetes treatment research on developing glp analogs 
biocon limited has developed in  a tablet for the oral delivery of insulin  which is currently in phase ii trials 
there are also a number of companies developing alternative means of delivering insulin in the form of oral pills  transdermal patches  and intranasal methods  which are at early stages of development 
in addition to other delivery systems for insulin  there are numerous products which have been approved for use in the treatment of type diabetics in substitution of  or in addition to  insulin therapy 
these products may also be considered competitive with insulin products 
buccal morphine and fentanyl products cephalon  inc received fda approval in september for fentora and launched the product in the united states shortly thereafter 
fentora is a fentanyl buccal tablet that is placed between the patient s upper cheek and gum and is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer who are already receiving and are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain 
cephalon anticipates submitting a nda to the fda in late to expand the labeled indications for fentora to include non cancer breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant patients 
other competing products commonly prescribed to treat persistent pain are ortho mcneil s duragesic and purdue pharmaceuticals oxycontin and ms contin 
mdrna  inc formerly nastech pharmaceuticals was developing an intranasal formulation of morphine that was in phase ii clinical trials  but announced in that they were decreasing their focus on intranasal products including morphine 
immunomedicine technology and products novavax  inc is a clinical stage biotechnology company which is developing vaccines to address a broad range of infectious diseases  including hn  seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus rsv using proprietary virus like particle technology 
in september  novavax announced favorable results from a phase ii clinical trial of its seasonal flu vaccination product and in august they announced positive preclinical results for a hn influenza product 
advaxis  inc uses a proprietary technique to bioengineer listeria bacteria to create a specific antigen that can stimulate an immune response after recognition by the recipient s immune system 
advaxis most advanced product candidate is lovaxin c  which is used to treat head and neck cancer and human papillomavirus hpv derived cervical cancer 
advaxis is currently in the phase i clinical trial stage for lovaxin c in and has prostate and breast cancer vaccines in preclinical phases 
micromet  inc uses two platform technologies to treat cancers  autoimmune diseases and inflammation i the creation of single chain antibodies scas through the use of the antigen binding region of a full sized antibody  held together by a linker  and ii bite technology which utilizes the body s ctls to attack tumor cells 
micromet is currently in phase ii clinical trials for its most developed product candidate  adecatumumab mt  for treatment of metastatic breast cancer 
sanofi pasteur inc  the vaccine division of sanofi aventis and one of the largest vaccines companies in the world  has product candidates including inoculations against varieties of infectious diseases 
it received fda approval for an hn avian influenza vaccine in april and for an hn vaccine in september dendreon corporation s product portfolio includes therapeutic vaccines  monoclonal antibodies and small molecules 
its most advanced product candidate now in phase iii clinical trials is provenge sipuleucel t  an investigational autologous patient specific active cellular immunotherapy aci for the treatment of prostate cancer 
phase iii trial data released in april indicated this product prolonged survival in men with advanced prostate cancer 
dendreon has completed phase i clinical trials in of lapuleucel t in patients with breast  ovarian and colorectal tumors 
lapuleucel t targets her positive cancers 
cell genesys  inc was developing products for the treatment of prostate cancer 
the gvax cancer treatments are composed of tumor cells that are genetically modified to secrete an immune stimulating cytokine and are irradiated for safety 
cell genesys and takeda pharmaceutical co 
entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for gvax in march in late  cell genesys announced they were terminating their phase iii trials for the gvax prostate cancer products 
cell genesys  in partnership with novartis ag  is also developing cg  an oncolytic virus therapy for the treatment of bladder cancer which is currently in phase i clinical trials 
pharmexa epimmune  inc  the us subsidiary of pharmexa a s was sold to korean company  vaxonco  inc  a korean company specializing in peptide based vaccines  in april pharmexa epimmune has in its product pipeline a peptide vaccine  gv  which is in phase iii clinical trials for pancreatic cancer and phase ii clinical trials for liver and non small cell lung cancer and two vaccines against her positive breast cancer in phase i and phase ii clinical trials 
pharmexa epimmune has received significant nih funding for vaccines against malaria and hiv  some of which are currently in phase i testing 
cel sci corporation s main product is multikine an immunotherapeutic agent being developed as a first line standard of care cancer treatment 
multikine s goal is to harness the body s natural ability to fight tumors 
cel sci is currently preparing to initiate a global phase iii clinical trial of multikine in patients with advanced primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity 
cel sci has also developed the ligand epitope antigen presentation system leaps delivery technology 
in april  cel sci filed a provisional us patent application covering cel  the lead product developed from the leaps technology  for the prevention treatment of bird flu and or as an adjuvant to be included in a bird flu vaccine  however this product has not yet reached the clinical trial stage 
large pharmaceutical companies such as merck co  inc  glaxosmithkline plc  novartis  inc  sanofi pasteur  inc 
and medimmune inc a subsidiary of astra zeneca  inc 
and others  also compete in the vaccine market 
these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support research and development efforts  conducting testing and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals to market products  as well as manufacturing and marketing approved products 
as such  they are also considered significant competitors in the field of immunomedicines 
there are also many smaller companies not specifically mentioned in the sections above which are also pursuing similar technologies 
environmental compliance our manufacturing  research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
we believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with all applicable government regulations 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials 
if an accident occurred  we could be held liable for damages  and these damages could severely impact our financial condition 
we are also subject to many environmental  health and workplace safety laws and regulations  particularly those governing laboratory procedures  exposure to blood borne pathogens  and the handling of hazardous biological materials 
violations and the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us 
however  we do not believe that compliance with the united states  canadian or other environmental laws will have a material effect on us in the foreseeable future 
research and development expenditures a substantial portion of our activities to date have been in research and development 
in the period from inception to july   our expenditures on research and development were  this included  in the year ended july  and  in the year ended july  the decrease in our research and development activities in compared to is due primarily to the reduction of our expenses in connection to phase iii clinical trials of our oral insulin product in canada and around the world 
financial information about geographic areas the regions in which we had identifiable assets and revenues and the amounts of such identifiable assets and revenues for each of the last two fiscal years are presented note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 
financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
identifiable assets are those that can be directly associated with a geographic area 
employees at september   we had forty three full time employees  including our employees at antigen and the generex mena branch office  as well as executive officers and other individuals who work for us full time but are employed by management companies that provide their services 
thirteen of our employees are executive and administrative  twenty five are scientific and technical personnel who engage primarily in development activities and in preparing formulations for testing and clinical trials  and five are engaged in corporate and product promotion and product sales 
we believe our employee relations are good 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we will continue to need qualified scientific personnel and personnel with experience in clinical testing  government regulation and manufacturing 
we may have difficulty in obtaining qualified scientific and technical personnel as there is strong competition for such personnel from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as universities and research institutions 
our business could be materially harmed if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified scientific  administrative and executive personnel to support our expanding activities  or if one or more members of our limited scientific and management staff were unable or unwilling to continue their association with us 
we have fixed term agreements with only certain members of our key management and scientific staff  including anna gluskin  our chief executive officer and president  rose perri  our chief operating officer and chief financial officer  mark fletcher  our executive vice president and general counsel  dr 
gerald bernstein  our vice president medical affairs  dr 
jaime davidson  our medical director  eric von hofe  president of antigen  minzhen xu  vice president biology of antigen  and nikoletta kallinteris  senior research associate 
we use non employee consultants to assist us in formulating research and development strategy  in preparing regulatory submissions  in developing protocols for clinical trials  and in designing  equipping and staffing our manufacturing facilities 
we also use non employee consultants to assist us in business development 
these consultants and advisors usually have the right to terminate their relationship with us on short notice 
loss of some of these key advisors could interrupt or delay development of one or more of our products or otherwise adversely affect our business plans 
item a 
risk factors our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks  uncertainties and other factors that you should be aware of  some of which are described below 
the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks  uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
any of the risks  uncertainties and other factors could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline substantially 
risks related to our financial condition we have a history of losses and will incur additional losses 
we are a development stage company with a limited history of operations  and do not expect sufficient revenues to support our operation in the immediately foreseeable future 
in the fiscal year ended july   we received modest revenues from sales of our over the counter confectionary products 
we did not recognize any revenue from the sale of our oral insulin product in ecuador or india in fiscal  although we did recognize  in licensing fee revenue relating to the signing of a licensing and distribution agreement for the sale of generex oral lyn in korea 
we do not expect to receive any revenues in ecuador until we enter into a definitive manufacturing and distribution agreement with our business partner there 
while we have entered into a licensing and distribution agreement with a leading indian based pharmaceutical company and insulin distributor  we do not anticipate significant revenue from the initial commercial launch of generex oral lyn in india sometime this fiscal year 
we also have entered in subdistribution agreements in lebanon and algeria but do not expect any signification revenue from the launch of the product in those countries in calendar year to date  we have not been profitable and our accumulated net loss available to shareholders was  at july  our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development  including clinical trials  and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
while we seek to attain profitability  we cannot be sure that we will ever achieve product and other revenue sufficient for us to attain this objective 
with the exception of generex oral lyn which is currently available for sale in ecuador and has been approved for sale in india  lebanon and algeria and our over the counter glucose and energy spray products  glucose rapidspray  baboom energy spray and crave nx  our product candidates are in research or early stages of pre clinical and clinical development 
we will need to conduct substantial additional research  development and clinical trials 
we will also need to receive necessary regulatory clearances both in the united states and foreign countries and obtain meaningful patent protection for and establish freedom to commercialize each of our product candidates 
we must also complete further clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for generex oral lyn in countries outside of ecuador  india  lebanon and algeria 
we cannot be sure that we will obtain required regulatory approvals  or successfully research  develop  commercialize  manufacture and market any other product candidates 
we expect that these activities  together with future general and administrative activities  will result in significant expenses for the foreseeable future 
we will need additional capital 
to progress in product development or marketing  we will need additional capital which may not be available to us 
this may delay our progress in product development or market 
we will require funds in excess of our existing cash resources to proceed with the development of our buccal insulin product  to finance the research and development of new products based on our buccal delivery and immunomedicine technologies  including clinical testing relating to new products  to finance the research and development activities of our subsidiary antigen with respect to other potential technologies  to commercially launch and market developed products  to develop or acquire other technologies or other lines of business  to establish and expand our manufacturing capabilities  to finance general and administrative activities that are not related to specific products under development  and to otherwise carry on business 
in the past  we have funded most of our development and other costs through equity financing 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations through the next twelve months 
however  this expectation is based on our current operating plan  which could change as a result of many factors  and we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
because our operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds in the near future to continue the development and commercialization of our products 
unforeseen problems  including materially negative developments in our clinical trials or in general economic conditions  could interfere with our ability to raise additional equity capital or materially adversely affect the terms upon which such funding is available 
it is possible that we will be unable to obtain additional funding as and when we need it 
if we were unable to obtain additional funding as and when needed  we could be forced to delay the progress of certain development efforts 
such a scenario poses risks 
for example  our ability to bring a product to market and obtain revenues could be delayed  our competitors could develop products ahead of us  and or we could be forced to relinquish rights to technologies  products or potential products 
our research and development and marketing efforts may be highly dependent on corporate collaborators and other third parties who may not devote sufficient time  resources and attention to our programs  which may limit our efforts to successfully develop and market potential products 
because we have limited resources  we have sought to enter into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical companies that will assist us in developing  testing  obtaining governmental approval for and commercializing products using our buccal delivery and immunomedicine technologies 
any collaborator with whom we may enter into such collaboration agreements may not support fully our research and commercial interests since our program may compete for time  attention and resources with such collaborator s internal programs 
therefore  these collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to our program to move it forward effectively  or that the program will advance as rapidly as it might if we had retained complete control of all research  development  regulatory and commercialization decisions 
risks related to our technologies with the exception of generex oral lyn  glucose rapidspray  baboom energy spray and crave nx  our technologies and products are at an early stage of development and we cannot expect significant revenues in respect thereof in the foreseeable future 
we have no products approved for commercial sale at the present time with the exception of generex oral lyn in ecuador  lebanon  algeria and india and our glucose sprays which are available over the counter in certain retail outlets in the united states and canada and in the middle east 
to be profitable  we must not only successfully research  develop and obtain regulatory approval for our products under development  but also manufacture  introduce  market and distribute them once development is completed 
we have yet to manufacture  market and distribute these products on a large scale commercial basis  and we expect to receive only modest revenues from product sales in fiscal year we may not be successful in one or more of these stages of the development or commercialization of our products  and or any of the products we develop may not be commercially viable 
until we can establish that they are commercially viable products  we will not receive significant revenues from ongoing operations 
until we receive regulatory approval to sell our pharmaceutical products in additional countries  our ability to generate revenues from operations may be limited and those revenues may be insufficient to sustain operations 
many factors impact our ability to obtain approvals for commercially viable products 
our only pharmaceutical product that has been approved for commercial sale by drug regulatory authorities is our oral insulin spray formulation  and that approval was obtained in ecuador  lebanon  algeria and india 
we have begun the regulatory approval process for our oral insulin  buccal morphine and fentanyl products in other countries  and we have initiated late stage clinical trials of generex oral lyn at some of our clinical trial sites in north america according to the phase iii clinical plan 
our immunomedicine products are in the pre clinical stage of development  with the exception of a phase ii trial in human patients with stage ii her neu positive breast cancer us  a phase i trial in human patients with prostate cancer athens  greece  a phase i trial in human patients with breast or ovarian cancer us and a phase i trial in human volunteers of a peptide vaccine for use against the hn avian influenza virus beirut  lebanon 
pre clinical and clinical trials of our products  and the manufacturing and marketing of our technologies  are subject to extensive  costly and rigorous regulation by governmental authorities in the united states  canada and other countries 
the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities often takes many years  is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidates 
for these reasons  it is possible we will not receive regulatory approval for any prescription pharmaceutical product candidate in any countries other than ecuador  lebanon  algeria and india 
in addition  we cannot be sure when or if we will be permitted by regulatory agencies to undertake additional clinical trials or to commence any particular phase of clinical trials 
because of this  statements in this annual report regarding the expected timing of clinical trials cannot be regarded as actual predictions of when we will obtain regulatory approval for any phase of clinical trials 
delays in obtaining united states or other foreign approvals for our pharmaceutical products could result in substantial additional costs to us  and  therefore  could adversely affect our ability to compete with other companies 
if regulatory approval is ultimately granted in any countries other than ecuador  lebanon  algeria and india  the approval may place limitations on the intended use of the product we wish to commercialize  and may restrict the way in which we are permitted to market the product 
due to legal and factual uncertainties regarding the scope and protection afforded by patents and other proprietary rights  we may not have meaningful protection from competition 
our long term success will substantially depend upon our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from infringement  misappropriation  discovery and duplication and avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others 
our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general  are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues 
because of this  our pending patent applications may not be granted 
these uncertainties also mean that any patents that we own or will obtain in the future could be subject to challenge  and even if not challenged  may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition 
due to our financial uncertainties  we may not possess the financial resources necessary to enforce our patents 
patents already issued to us or our pending applications may become subject to dispute  and any dispute could be resolved against us 
because a substantial number of patents have been issued in the field of alternative drug delivery and because patent positions can be highly uncertain and frequently involve complex legal and factual questions  the breadth of claims obtained in any application or the enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted 
consequently  we do not know whether any of our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or  to the extent patents have been issued or will be issued  whether these patents will be subject to further proceedings limiting their scope  will provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantage  or will be circumvented or invalidated 
also because of these legal and factual uncertainties  and because pending patent applications are held in secrecy for varying periods in the united states and other countries  even after reasonable investigation we may not know with certainty whether any products that we or a licensee may develop will infringe upon any patent or other intellectual property right of a third party 
for example  we are aware of certain patents owned by third parties that such parties could attempt to use in the future in efforts to affect our freedom to practice some of the patents that we own or have applied for 
based upon the science and scope of these third party patents  we believe that the patents that we own or have applied for do not infringe any such third party patents  however  we cannot know for certain whether we could successfully defend our position  if challenged 
we may incur substantial costs if we are required to defend our intellectual property in patent suits brought by third parties 
these legal actions could seek damages and seek to enjoin testing  manufacturing and marketing of the accused product or process 
in addition to potential liability for significant damages  we could be required to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market the accused product or process 
risks related to marketing of our potential products we may not become  or stay  profitable even if our pharmaceutical products are approved for sale 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market our oral insulin product outside of ecuador  india  lebanon and algeria or to market any other prescription pharmaceutical product candidate  many factors may prevent the product from ever being sold in commercial quantities 
some of these factors are beyond our control  such as acceptance of the formulation or treatment by health care professionals and diabetic patients  the availability  effectiveness and relative cost of alternative diabetes or immunomedicine treatments that may be developed by competitors  and the availability of third party ie  insurer and governmental agency reimbursements 
we will not receive significant revenues from generex oral lyn or any of our other pharmaceuticals products that may receive regulatory approval until we can successfully manufacture  market and distribute them in the relevant markets 
similarly  the successful commercialization of our over the counter glucose spray products may be hindered by manufacturing  marketing and distribution limitations 
we have to depend upon others for marketing and distribution of our products  and we may be forced to enter into contracts limiting the benefits we may receive and the control we have over our products 
we intend to rely on collaborative arrangements with one or more other companies that possess strong marketing and distribution resources to perform these functions for us 
we may not be able to enter into beneficial contracts  and we may be forced to enter into contracts for the marketing and distribution of our products that substantially limit the potential benefits to us from commercializing these products 
in addition  we will not have the same control over marketing and distribution that we would have if we conducted these functions ourselves 
we may not be able to compete with treatments now being marketed and developed  or which may be developed and marketed in the future by other companies 
our products will compete with existing and new therapies and treatments 
we are aware of a number of companies currently seeking to develop alternative means of delivering insulin  as well as new drugs intended to replace insulin therapy at least in part 
we are also aware of a number of companies currently seeking to develop alternative means of enhancing and suppressing peptides 
in the longer term  we also face competition from companies that seek to develop cures for diabetes and other malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases through techniques for correcting the genetic deficiencies that underlie such diseases 
numerous pharmaceutical  biotechnology and drug delivery companies  hospitals  research organizations  individual scientists and nonprofit organizations are engaged in the development of alternatives to our technologies 
some of these companies have greater research and development capabilities  experience  manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
collaborations or mergers between large pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with competing drug delivery technologies could enhance our competitors financial  marketing and other resources 
developments by other drug delivery companies could make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in developing competing technologies  obtaining fda approval for products or gaining market acceptance more rapidly than we can 
some of our most significant competitors  pfizer  eli lilly  and novo nordisk  have announced that they will discontinue development and or sale of their inhalable forms of insulin 
unlike inhaled insulin formulations  generex oral lyn is a buccally absorbed formulation with no residual pulmonary deposition 
we believe that our buccal delivery technology offers several advantages over inhaled insulin  including the avoidance of pulmonary inhalation  which requires frequent physician monitoring  ease of use and portability 
if government programs and insurance companies do not agree to pay for or reimburse patients for our pharmaceutical products  our success will be impacted 
sales of our oral insulin formulation in ecuador  lebanon  algeria and india and our other potential pharmaceutical products in other markets will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement by third party payers such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other organizations 
third party payers often challenge the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
governmental approval of health care products does not guarantee that these third party payers will pay for the products 
even if third party payers do accept our product  the amounts they pay may not be adequate to enable us to realize a profit 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our products are approved for marketing and any such changes could further limit reimbursement 
risks related to potential liabilities we face significant product liability risks  which may have a negative effect on our financial condition 
the administration of drugs or treatments to humans  whether in clinical trials or commercially  can result in product liability claims whether or not the drugs or treatments are actually at fault for causing an injury 
furthermore  our pharmaceutical products may cause  or may appear to have caused  serious adverse side effects including death or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug or treatment has been administered to patients for some time 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments or settlements against us  which could have a severe negative effect on our financial condition 
we maintain product liability insurance in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable for our current level of activity and exposure  but claims could exceed our coverage limits 
furthermore  due to factors in the insurance market generally and our own experience  we may not always be able to purchase sufficient insurance at an affordable price 
even if a product liability claim is not successful  the adverse publicity and time and expense of defending such a claim may interfere with our business 
risks related to the market for our common stock our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
on july   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market that we were not compliance with marketplace rule c now known as listing rule a  which requires us to have a minimum bid price per share of at least for thirty consecutive business days 
in accordance with this rule  we had calendar days  or until january   subject to extension  to regain compliance with this rule 
on october   nasdaq temporarily suspended enforcement of the minimum bid price requirement until january  on december   nasdaq extended the temporary suspension of enforcement until april   and  on march   nasdaq further extended the temporary suspension until july  and  on july   nasdaq further extended the temporary suspension until july  with the extended suspension  we now have until november  to comply with the minimum bid price requirement 
therefore  if  at any time prior to november   the bid price of our common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum period of ten consecutive business days  we will regain compliance with the rule 
in the event that we cannot demonstrate compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by the specified deadline and are not eligible for an additional compliance period  the staff will notify us that our stock would be delisted  at which time we can appeal the staff s determination to a listing qualifications panel 
pending the decision of the listing qualification panel  our common stock will continue to trade on the nasdaq capital market 
if we are not successful in such an appeal  our stock would likely trade on nasdaq s over the counter bulletin board  assuming we meet the requisite criteria 
if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable nasdaq rules and our stock is delisted from the nasdaq capital market  it may become subject to penny stock regulations and there will be less interest for our stock in the market 
this may result in lower prices for our stock and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing 
if our stock is not listed on nasdaq and fails to maintain a price of or more per share  our stock would become subject to the securities and exchange commission s penny stock rules 
these rules require a broker to deliver  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its risks 
additionally  broker dealers who recommend penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination and receive the purchaser s written agreement to a transaction prior to the sale 
in the event our stock becomes subject to these rules  it will become more difficult for broker dealers to sell our common stock 
therefore  it may be more difficult for us to obtain financing 
the price of our common stock may be volatile 
there may be wide fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
these fluctuations may be caused by several factors including announcements of research activities and technology innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in market valuation of companies in our industry generally  variations in operating results  changes in governmental regulations  developments in patent and other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of drugs or treatments developed by us or others  results of clinical trials of our products or our competitors products  and regulatory action or inaction on our products or our competitors products 
from time to time  we may hire companies to assist us in pursuing investor relations strategies to generate increased volumes of investment in our common stock 
such activities may result  among other things  in causing the price of our common stock to increase on a short term basis 
furthermore  the stock market generally and the market for stocks of companies with lower market capitalizations and small biopharmaceutical companies  like us  have from time to time experienced  and likely will again experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company 
during the third calendar quarter of and continuing to date  we  like many other publicly traded companies  have experienced a sharp decline in the price of our stock attributable to concerns about the current global recession 
the widespread decline in stock prices led the nasdaq stock market to further extend its temporary suspension of enforcement of the minimum bid price requirement until july  provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation could delay or prevent the acquisition or sale of our business 
our restated certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to designate new series of preferred stock and issue those shares without any vote or action by our stockholders 
such newly authorized and issued shares of preferred stock could contain terms that grant special voting rights to the holders of such shares that make it more difficult to obtain stockholder approval for an acquisition of our business or increase the cost of any such acquisition 
our recent equity financing will dilute current stockholders and could prevent the acquisition or sale of our business 
the equity financing transactions into which we have recently entered have and will dilute current stockholders 
currently approximately  shares of common stock are issuable upon exercise of the warrants that we issued on march   may   june   august  and september  without regard to additional shares which may become issuable due to anti dilution adjustments or in connection with payments of interest  which represents approximately of the shares of common stock currently outstanding 
assuming the holders of the warrants convert and exercise all of the warrants into shares of common stock  the number of shares of issued and outstanding common stock will increase significantly  and current stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the outstanding common stock of generex 
the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the warrants will also have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
in addition  the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants sold in the offerings that closed on june   august  and september  and sold or re priced in our march  private placement could have an anti takeover effect because such issuance will make it more difficult for  or discourage an attempt by  a party to obtain control of the company by tender offer or other means 
the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of the warrants will increase the number of shares entitled to vote  increase the number of votes required to approve a change of control of the company  and dilute the interest of a party attempting to obtain control of the company 
if we raise funds through one or more additional equity financings in the future  it will have a further dilutive effect on existing holders of our shares by reducing their percentage ownership 
the shares may be sold at a time when the market price is low because we need the funds 
this will dilute existing holders more than if our stock price was higher 
in addition  equity financings normally involve shares sold at a discount to the current market price

our executive and principal administrative offices occupy approximately  square feet of office space in the business centre at harbour square in downtown toronto  ontario  canada 
we own the business centre  which comprises approximately  square feet of usable space 
the space in the business centre that is not used by us is leased to third parties 
we own a laboratory facility in toronto that we have used for limited production of our oral insulin formulation for clinical purposes  and have completed a pilot manufacturing facility for our insulin and glucose products in the same commercial complex 
our laboratory facility is approximately  square feet 
our pilot manufacturing facility  which also includes laboratory facilities  is approximately  square feet

these units are currently leased to third parties with the exception of two units being used by us for packaging and storage 
these units are reflected in assets held for investments on accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
all of these spaces could be used for manufacturing facilities if necessary 
we have obtained regulatory approval for the laboratory facility and the pilot manufacturing facility 
we have mortgages on our toronto properties totaling  at july  these mortgages require the payment of interest  with minimal principal reduction  prior to their due dates 
these mortgages currently require an aggregate approximately  in monthly debt service payments 
aggregate principal maturities for these mortgages will be  in fiscal we lease approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space in worcester  massachusetts that antigen uses for its research and development activities at an annual rent of approximately  this space is sufficient for antigen s present activities 
we do not expect to need additional manufacturing capabilities in canada related to our insulin product beyond our pilot facility before the end of the current fiscal year 
we own an  square foot building in brampton  ontario  which is approximately miles outside toronto  and a  square foot building in mississauga  ontario  which is about miles from downtown toronto 
both properties are currently leased to third parties 
these properties are reflected in assets held for investments on accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we could use our other properties to expand research  development or testing of our buccal and immunomedicine products if current facilities prove inadequate for our needs 
we also may consider other opportunities to expand our manufacturing capabilities as such opportunities arise 
item legal proceedings 
subash chandarana et al 
v 
generex biotechnology corporation 
in february  a former business associate of pankaj modi modi a former officer of the company and an entity called centrum technologies inc cti commenced an action in the ontario superior court of justice against us and modi seeking  among other things  damages for alleged breaches of contract and tortious acts related to a business relationship between this former associate and modi that ceased in july the plaintiffs statement of claim also seeks to enjoin the use  if any  by us of three patents allegedly owned by cti 
the three patents are entitled liquid formulations for proteinic pharmaceuticals  vaccine delivery system for immunization  using biodegradable polymer microspheres  and controlled releases of drugs or hormones in biodegradable polymer microspheres 
it is our position that the buccal drug delivery technologies which are the subject matter of our research  development  and commercialization efforts  including generex oral lyn and the rapidmist diabetes management system  do not make use of  are not derivative of  do not infringe upon  and are entirely different from the intellectual property identified in the plaintiffs statement of claim 
on july   we filed a preliminary motion to dismiss the action of cti as a nonexistent entity or  alternatively  to stay such action on the grounds of want of authority of such entity to commence the action 
the plaintiffs brought a cross motion to amend the statement of claim to substitute centrum biotechnologies  inc cbi for cti 
cbi is a corporation of which percent of the shares are owned by the former business associate and the remaining percent are owned by us 
consequently  the shareholders of cbi are in a deadlock 
the court granted our motion to dismiss the action of cti and denied the plaintiffs cross motion without prejudice to the former business associate to seek leave to bring a derivative action in the name of or on behalf of cbi 
the former business associate subsequently filed an application with the ontario superior court of justice for an order granting him leave to file an action in the name of and on behalf of cbi against modi and us 
we opposed the application 
in september  the ontario superior court of justice granted the request and issued an order giving the former business associate leave to file an action in the name of and on behalf of cbi against modi and us 
a statement of claim was served in july since that time  the plaintiffs have not taken any steps in furtherance of the proceeding 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding at the present time or to estimate an amount or range of potential loss  if any  from this legal proceeding 
michael powell 
in august   michael powell commenced an action against certain defendants  including us and certain of our officers  in the ontario superior court of justice  claiming compensatory damages  special and punitive damages and various forms of injunctive and declaratory relief for breach of contract and various business torts 
we believe the claims against us are frivolous and completely without merit 
we are not a party to any agreement with the plaintiff 
much of the requested relief relates to the plaintiff s position and ownership interest in and accounting for the expenses of an entity in which generex has no interest 
we have not used any intellectual property or information owned by the other entity 
all intellectual property  information and business claimed to be owned or conducted by the entity in which the plaintiff claims an interest are completely unrelated to any product or technology we are currently developing or intend to develop 
therefore  even if the court were to award some declaratory or injunctive relief  we would not be affected 
we are defending this action vigorously 
we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding at the present time or to estimate an amount or range of potential loss  if any  from this legal proceeding 
we are involved in certain other legal proceedings in addition to those specifically described herein 
subject to the uncertainty inherent in all litigation  we do not believe at the present time that the resolution of any of these legal proceedings is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  operations or cash flows 
with respect to all litigation matters  as additional information concerning the estimates used by us becomes known  we reassess each matter s position both with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures
