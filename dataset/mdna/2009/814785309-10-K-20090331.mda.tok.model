during the year ended december   securitynational mortgage experienced an increase in revenues and expenses due to the increase in mortgage loan revenue 
securitynational mortgage is a mortgage lender incorporated under the laws of the state of utah 
securitynational mortgage is approved and regulated by the federal housing administration fha  a department of the us department of housing and urban development hud  to originate mortgage loans that qualify for government insurance in the event of default by the borrower

for the twelve months ended december    and  securitynational mortgage originated and sold  loans  total volume   loans  total volume and  loans  total volume  respectively 
securitynational mortgage has loan purchase agreements with unaffiliated warehouse banks 
the total amount available under these loan purchase agreements at december  was  as of december   mortgage loans totaling approximately  have been sold and were outstanding 
the terms of the loan purchase agreements are typically for one year  with interest rates ranging from to over the days libor rate from to as of december  
securitynational mortgage renewed one of its loan purchase agreements that expired on september  for another one year term 
the other loan purchase agreement is a non committed purchase agreement with no expiration date  however  the company received notice from the warehouse bank that the agreement would be terminated in february the company is actively pursuing purchase agreements with other warehouse banks 
mortgage fee income consists of origination fees  processing fees and certain other income related to the origination and sale of mortgage loans 
for mortgage loans sold to third party investors  mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized pursuant to sfas at the time the sales of mortgage loans meet the sales criteria for the transfer of financial assets which are the transferred assets have been isolated from the company and its creditors  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the mortgage  and the company does not maintain effective control over the transferred mortgage 
the company has determined that all three criteria are met at the time the loan is funded 
all rights and title to the mortgage loans are assigned to unrelated financial institution investors  including any investor commitments for these loans prior to warehouse banks purchasing these loans under the purchase commitments 
the company sells all loans to third party investors without recourse 
however  the company may be required to repurchase loans or pay a fee instead of repurchase under certain events such as the following failure to deliver original documents specified by the investor 
the existence of fraud in the origination of the loan 
the loan becomes delinquent due to nonpayment during the first several months after it is sold 
early pay off of a loan  as defined by the agreements 
excessive time to settle a loan 
investor declines purchase 
discontinued product and expired commitment upon completion of a transfer that satisfies the conditions to be accounted for as a sale  the company initially measures at fair value liabilities incurred in a sale relating to any guarantee or recourse provisions 
the company accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors of basis points of total production 
this estimate is based on the company s historical experience 
the amount accrued for the twelve months ended december  was  and the charge to expense has been included in other general and administrative expenses 
the estimated liability for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and accrued expenses as of december  the balance was  purchase commitments generally specify a date to days after delivery upon which the underlying loans should be settled 
depending on market conditions  these commitment settlement dates can be extended at a cost to the company 
generally  a ten day extension will cost 
basis points of the loan amount 
the company s historical data shows that of all loans originated by the company are generally settled by the investors as agreed within days after delivery 
there are situations when the company determines that it is unable to enforce the settlement of loans rejected by the third party investors and that it is in the company s best interest to repurchase those loans from the warehouse banks 
it is the company s policy to cure any documentation problems with respect to such loans at a minimal cost for up to a six month time period and to pursue efforts to enforce purchase commitments from third party investors concerning mortgage loans and to cure any documentation problems with respect to such loans at a minimal cost for up to a six month time period 
the company believes that six months allows adequate time to remedy any documentation issues  to enforce purchase commitments  and to exhaust other alternatives 
remedy methods include  but are not limited to research reasons for rejection provide additional documents request investor exceptions appeal rejection decision to purchase committee commit to secondary investors once purchase commitments have expired and other alternatives to remedy are exhausted  which could be earlier than the six month time period  the loans are repurchased and transferred to the long term investment portfolio at the lower of cost or market value and previously recorded sales revenue is reversed 
any loan that subsequently becomes delinquent is evaluated by the company at that time and any allowances for impairment are adjusted accordingly 
determining lower of cost or market cost is equal to the amount paid to the warehouse bank and the amount originally funded by the company 
market value is often difficult to determine  but is based on the following for loans that have an active market we use the market price on the repurchased date 
for loans where there is no market but there is a similar product  we use the market value for the similar product on the repurchased date 
for loans where no active market exists on the repurchased date  we determine that the unpaid principal balance best approximates the market value on the repurchased date  after considering the fair value of the underlying real estate collateral and estimated future cash flows 
the appraised value of the real estate underlying the original loan adds significance to the company s determination of fair value since  if the loan becomes delinquent  the company has sufficient value to collect the unpaid principal balance or the carrying value of the loan 
in determining the market value on the date of repurchase the company looks at the total value of all of the loans since any sale of loans would be as a pool 
for mortgages originated and held for investment  mortgage fee income and related expenses are recognized when the loan is originated 
the mortgage industry is still experiencing substantial change due to higher than expected delinquencies from subprime loans 
the market for new subprime loans has been substantially reduced and several mortgage companies whose primary product was subprime mortgage originations have ceased operations 
the company funded  of the company s production in subprime loans during the twelve months ending december  and eliminated subprime loans from its product offerings in august the company believes that its potential losses from subprime loans are minimal 
the industry problem with subprime mortgages has created a volatile secondary market for other products  especially alternative documentation alt a loans 
alt a loans are typically offered to qualified borrowers who have relatively high credit scores but are not required to provide full documentation to support personal income and assets owned 
alt a loans can have a loan to value ratio as high as 
as a result of these changes  the company discontinued offering these loans in september as a result of the volatile secondary market for mortgage loans  the company sold mortgage loans to certain third party investors that experienced financial difficulties and were not able to settle the loans 
the total amount of these loans was  of which  were in loans where the secondary market no longer exists 
due to these changes in circumstances  the company regained control of the mortgages and  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounted for the loans retained in the same manner as a purchase of the assets from the former transferee s in exchange for liabilities assumed 
at the time of repurchase  the loans were determined to be held for investment  and the fair value of the loans was determined to approximate the unpaid principal balances adjusted for chargeoffs  the related allowance for loan losses  and net deferred fees or costs on originated loans 
the financial statements reflect the transfer of the mortgage loans from mortgage loans sold to investors to mortgage loans on real estate 
the loan sale revenue recorded on the sale of the mortgage loans was reversed on the date the loans were repurchased 
as a standard in the industry  the company received payments on the mortgage loans during the time period between the sale date and settlement or repurchase date 
the company will service these loans through security national life  its life insurance subsidiary 
as of december   the company s long term mortgage loan portfolio had  in unpaid principal with delinquencies more than days 
of this amount  was in foreclosure proceedings 
the company has not received any interest income on the  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
during the twelve months ended december   the company increased its allowance for mortgage losses by  which was charged to loan loss expense and included in other general and administrative expenses for the period 
the allowance for mortgage loan losses as of december  was  also at december   the company has foreclosed on  in long term mortgage loans 
the foreclosed property was shown in real estate 
the company will be able to carry the foreclosed property in security national life and securitynational mortgage  its life and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is feasible to sell

significant accounting policies the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
please also refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
insurance operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
the company has the ability to mitigate adverse experience through sound underwriting  asset liability duration matching  sound actuarial practices  adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends and cost of insurance charges 
cemetery and mortuary operations pre need sales of funeral services and caskets  including revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need funeral services and caskets  are deferred until the services are performed or the caskets are delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery interment rights are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate sfas no 

under sfas  recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenues related to the pre need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of sfas described above 
pre need sales of cemetery merchandise primarily markers and vaults revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise are deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery services primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery services are deferred until the services are performed

 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises fas no 

obtaining costs  which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business  are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed 
revenues and costs for at need sales are recorded when a valid contract exists  the services are performed  collection is reasonably assured and there are no significant obligations remaining 
mortgage operations mortgage fee income is generated through the origination and refinancing of mortgage loans and is realized in accordance with sfas no 
the majority of loans originated are sold to third party investors 
the amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as mortgage loans sold to investors  and include the fees due from the investors 
use of significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  and critical issues that impact them fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is included in stockholders equity after adjustment for deferred income taxes and deferred acquisition costs related to universal life products 
the company is required to exercise judgment to determine when a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following yield on investments supporting the liabilities  amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies  amount of policy fees and charges  amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  amount of death and surrender benefits  and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
value of business acquired value of business acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs 
the critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for value of business acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company accrues an estimate of potential losses for the collection of receivables 
the significant receivables are the result of receivables due on mortgage loans sold to investors  cemetery and mortuary operations  mortgage loan operations and other receivables 
the allowance is based upon the company s experience 
the critical issues that would impact recovery of the cemetery and mortuary receivables is the overall economy 
the critical issues that would impact recovery of mortgage loan operations would be interest rate risk and loan underwriting 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  expenses  investment yield  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
unearned revenue the universal life products the company sells have significant policy initiation fees front end load that are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
the same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue 
deferred pre need cemetery and funeral contracts revenues and estimated future cost of pre need sales the revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or the service is performed 
the company  through its mortuary and cemetery operations  provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices 
to accomplish this  the company  through its life insurance operations  sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries 
if  at the time of need  the policyholder potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the company s facilities  the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price 
the increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices 
risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy 
mortgage allowance for loan loss and loan loss reserve the company provides allowances for losses on its mortgage loans through an allowance for loan losses a contra asset account and through the mortgage loan loss reserve a liability account 
the allowance for loan losses and doubtful accounts is an allowance for losses on the company s mortgage loans held for investment 
when a mortgage loan is past due more than days  the company  where appropriate  sets up an allowance to approximate the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral 
once a loan is past due more than days the company does not accrue any interest income and proceeds to foreclose on the real estate 
all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as incurred 
once foreclosed the carrying value will approximate its fair value and the amount will be classified as real estate 
the company will be able to carry the foreclosed property in security national life and securitynational mortgage  its life and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is feasible to sell them 
the company is currently able to rent properties at a average return 
the mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
the company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or  in lieu of repurchase  to pay a negotiated fee to the investors 
the company s estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses and doubtful accounts and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
deferred compensation the company has deferred compensation agreements with several of its current and past executive officers 
the deferred compensation is payable upon retirement or death of these individuals either in annual installments ten years or lump sum settlement  if approved by the board of directors 
the company has accrued the present value of these benefits based upon their future retirement dates and other factors  on its consolidated financial statements 
depreciation depreciation is calculated principally on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful life or remaining lease terms 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain casualty insurance  workers compensation and liability programs 
self insurance reserves are maintained relative to these programs 
the level of exposure from catastrophic events is limited by the purchase of stop loss and aggregate liability reinsurance coverages 
when estimating the self insurance liabilities and related reserves  management considers a number of factors  which include historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and valuations provided independent third party actuaries 
management reviews its assumptions with its independent third party administrators and actuaries to evaluate whether the self insurance reserves are adequate 
if actual claims or adverse development of loss reserves occurs and exceed these estimates  additional reserves may be required 
the estimation process contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date

risks the following is a description of the most significant risks facing the company and how it mitigates those risks legal regulatory risk the risk that changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which the company operates will create additional expenses and or risks not anticipated by the company in developing and pricing its products 
that is  regulatory initiatives designed to reduce insurer profits  new legal theories or insurance company insolvencies through guaranty fund assessments may create costs for the insurer beyond those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  changes in tax law with respect to mortgage interest deductions or other public policy or legislative changes may affect the company s mortgage sales 
also  the company may be subject to further regulations in the cemetery mortuary business 
the company mitigates these risks by offering a wide range of products and by diversifying its operations  thus reducing its exposure to any single product or jurisdiction  and also by employing underwriting practices which identify and minimize the adverse impact of such risks 
the recent adverse developments in the mortgage industry and credit markets have adversely affected the company s ability to sell certain of its mortgage loans to investors  which has impacted the company s financial results by requiring it to assume the risk of holding and servicing many of these loans 
the mortgage industry is still experiencing substantial change due to higher than expected delinquencies from subprime loans 
the market for new subprime loans has been substantially reduced and several mortgage companies whose primary product was subprime mortgage originations have ceased operations 
the company funded million of the company s production in subprime loans during the twelve months ending december  and eliminated subprime loans from its product offerings in august the company believes that its potential losses from subprime loans are minimal 
the industry problem with subprime mortgages has created a volatile secondary market for other products  especially alternative documentation alt a loans 
alt a loans are typically offered to qualified borrowers who have relatively high credit scores but are not required to provide full documentation to support personal income and assets owned 
alt a loans can have a loan to value ratio as high as 
as a result of these changes  the company discontinued offering these loans in september as a result of the volatile secondary market  for mortgage loans  the company sold mortgage loans to certain third party investors that experienced financial difficulties and were not able to settle the loans 
the total amount of these loans was  of which  were in loans where the secondary market no longer exists 
due to these changes in circumstances  the company regained control of the mortgages and  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounted for the loans retained in the same manner as a purchase of the assets from the former transferee s in exchange for liabilities assumed 
at the time of repurchase  the loans were determined to be held for investment  and the fair value of the loans was determined to approximate the unpaid principal balances adjusted for chargeoffs  the related allowance for loan losses  and net deferred fees or costs on originated loans 
the financial statements reflect the transfer of the mortgage loans from mortgage loans sold to investors to mortgage loans on real estate 
the loan sale revenue recorded on the sale of the mortgage loans was reversed on the date the loans were repurchased 
as a standard in the industry  the company received payments on the mortgage loans during the time period between the sale date and settlement or repurchase date 
the company will service these loans through security national life  its life insurance subsidiary 
the company provides allowances for losses on its mortgage loans through an allowance for loan losses a contra asset account and through the mortgage loan loss reserve a liability account 
the allowance for loan losses and doubtful accounts is an allowance for losses on the company s mortgage loans held for investment 
when a mortgage loan is past due more than days  the company  where appropriate  sets up an allowance to approximate the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral 
once a loan is past due more than days the company does not accrue any interest income and proceeds to foreclose on the real estate 
all expenses for foreclosure are expensed as incurred 
once foreclosed  the carrying value will approximate its fair value and the amount will be classified as real estate 
the company will be able to carry the foreclosed property in security national life and securitynational mortgage  its life and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is feasible to sell 
the company is currently able to rent properties at a average return 
the mortgage loan loss reserve is an estimate of probable losses at the balance sheet date that the company will realize in the future on mortgage loans sold to third party investors 
the company may be required to reimburse third party investors for costs associated with early payoff of loans within the first six months of such loans and to repurchase loans where there is a default in any of the first four monthly payments to the investors or  in lieu of repurchase  to pay a negotiated fee to the investors 
the company s estimates are based upon historical loss experience and the best estimate of the probable loan loss liabilities 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses and doubtful accounts and the loan loss reserve represent probable loan losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
as of december   the company s long term mortgage loan portfolio had  in unpaid principal with delinquencies more than days 
of this amount  was in foreclosure proceedings 
the company has not received any interest income on the  in mortgage loans with delinquencies more than days 
during the year ended december   the company has increased its allowance for mortgage loan losses by  which allowance was charged to loan loss expense and is included in other general and administrative expenses for the period 
the allowance for mortgage loan losses as of december  was  also  at december   the company had foreclosed on  in long term mortgage loans 
the foreclosed property is shown in real estate 
the company will be able to carry the foreclosed property in security national life and securitynational mortgage  its life and mortgage subsidiaries  and will rent the properties until it is feasible to sell 
in addition to the allowance for mortgage loan losses  the company also accrues a monthly allowance for indemnification losses to investors of basis points of total production 
the amount accrued for the twelve months ended december  was  and included in other general and administrative expenses 
the reserve for indemnification losses is included in other liabilities and  as of december   the balance was  securitynational mortgage has entered into loan purchase agreements with unaffiliated warehouse banks 
the total amount available under these loan purchase agreements at december  was  as of december   mortgage loans totaling approximately  have been sold and were outstanding 
the terms of the loan purchase agreements are typically for one year  with interest rates ranging from to over the days libor rate from to as of december 
securitynational mortgage renewed one of its loan purchase agreements that expired on september  for another one year term 
the other loan purchase agreement is a non committed purchase agreement with no expiration date  however  the company received notice from the warehouse bank that the agreement would be terminated in february the company is actively pursuing purchase agreements with other warehouse bank 
interest rate risk the risk that interest rates will change which may cause a decrease in the value of the company s investments or impair the ability of the company to market its mortgage and cemetery mortuary products 
this change in rates may cause certain interest sensitive products to become uncompetitive or may cause disintermediation 
the company mitigates this risk by charging fees for non conformance with certain policy provisions  by offering products that transfer this risk to the purchaser  and or by attempting to match the maturity schedule of its assets with the expected payouts of its liabilities 
to the extent that liabilities come due more quickly than assets mature  the company might have to borrow funds or sell assets prior to maturity and potentially recognize a loss on the sale 
mortality morbidity risk the risk that the company s actuarial assumptions may differ from actual mortality morbidity experience may cause the company s products to be underpriced  may cause the company to liquidate insurance or other claims earlier than anticipated and other potentially adverse consequences to the business 
the company minimizes this risk through sound underwriting practices  asset liability duration matching  and sound actuarial practices 
estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the estimates susceptible to significant change are those used in determining the liability for future policy benefits and claims  those used in determining valuation allowances for mortgage loans on real estate  construction loans and other receivables  and those used in determining the estimated future costs for pre need sales 
although some variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are adequate 
liquidity and capital resources the company s life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums  contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business  from interest and dividends on invested assets  and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments 
the mortgage subsidiary realizes cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors 
the company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities  which generally are long term  and adequate to pay current policyholder claims  annuity payments  expenses on the issuance of new policies  the maintenance of existing policies  debt service  and to meet operating expenses 
during the twelve months ended december   the company s operations provided cash of  while cash totaling  was provided by operations during the twelve months ended december  this was due primarily to a decrease of  in and an increase of  in in the balance of mortgage loans sold to investors 
the company s liability for future life  annuity and other benefits is expected to be paid out over long term due to the company s market niche of selling funeral plans 
funeral plans are small face value life insurance that will pay the costs and expenses incurred at the time of a person s death 
a person generally will keep these policies in force and will not surrender them prior to a person s death 
because of the long term nature of these liabilities the company is able to hold to maturity its bonds and mortgage loans thus reducing the risk of liquidating these long term investments as a result of any sudden changes in market values 
the company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities 
the company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing  however  to date  that has not been necessary 
the company purchases short term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short term requirements of the company s products 
the company s investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return  which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements 
the company s investment policy is to invest predominantly in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  and warehousing of mortgage loans on a short term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries 
bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to  as of december  compared to  as of december  this represents and of the total investments as of december   and december   respectively 
generally  all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the national association of insurance commissioners 
under this rating system  there are six categories used for rating bonds 
at december   or  and at december   or  of the company s total bond investments were invested in bonds in rating categories three through six  which are considered non investment grade 
the company has classified certain of its fixed income securities  including high yield securities  in its portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder classified as held to maturity 
however  in accordance with company policy  any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity 
business conditions  however  may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio 
in that event the company believes it could sell short term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer term securities 
see footnote in the consolidated financial statement for the schedule of the maturity of fixed maturity securities 
the amortized cost and contractual payments on mortgage loans on real estate available for sale by category are shown below

 fair value measurements sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of january  for financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  and establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date  expands disclosures about financial instruments measured at fair value 
financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value are categorized based on the reliability of inputs to the valuation techniques as follows level financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that we can access 
level financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are based on the following a quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  b quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets  or c valuation models whose inputs are observable  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs may reflect our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the financial assets and financial liabilities 
we utilize a combination of third party valuation service providers  brokers  and internal valuation models to determine fair value

based on the analysis  a determination is made whether a security will likely recover from the loss position within a reasonable period of time 
if it is unlikely that the investment will recover from the loss position  the loss is considered to be other than temporary  the security is written down to the impaired value and an impairment loss is recognized

interest rate lock commitments 
during  the company s mortgage banking activities implemented new practices relating to mortgage loan commitments  including interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments to sell loans to third party investors 
the company also implemented a hedging strategy for these transactions

bank loan interest rate swaps 
management considers the interest rate swap instrument an effective cash flow hedge against the variable interest rate on bank borrowings since the interest rate swap mirrors the term of the note payable and expires on the maturity date of the bank loan it hedges 
the interest rate swap is a derivative financial instrument carried at its fair value
