quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and derivative financial instruments the company has certain financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates 
the company s financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest 
at present  the company has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments to fix the interest rate on any portion of its financing arrangements with floating rates 
accordingly  based on current debt levels at december   if market interest rates increase one percent  the company s interest expense would increase approximately  annually 
some of the company s subsidiaries operate in foreign countries and their financial results are subject to exchange rate movements 
the company has operations in canada with foreign currency exposure  primarily due to sales made from businesses in canada to customers in the united states 
these sales are denominated in us dollars 
in addition  the company s subsidiary in brazil has loans denominated in us dollars 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began a systematic program to limit its exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates related to certain assets and liabilities of its operations in canada and brazil that are denominated in us dollars 
the net exposure generally ranges from to million 
the foreign currency contracts and arrangements created under this program are not designated as hedged items under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and accordingly  the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency arrangements  which have been immaterial  are recorded in the income statement 
the company s foreign currency arrangements are generally three months or less and  as of december   the company had no foreign currency arrangements or contracts in place 
the company uses certain commodities  primarily plastic resins  in its manufacturing processes 
the cost of operations can be affected as the market for these commodities changes 
the company currently has no derivative contracts to hedge this risk  however  the company also has no significant purchase obligations to purchase fixed quantities of such commodities in future periods 
in  the cost of most plastic resins used in the company s business has increased more than percent compared to the prior year 
continuing increases in the cost of plastic resin or future adverse changes in the general economic environment could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in the summary of significant accounting policies included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  the amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported are affected by estimates and judgements that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
we believe the following matters may involve a high degree of judgement and complexity 
bad debts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial 
table of contents obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the company also reviews historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due the company could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for approximately percent of the company s inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill as a result of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  recorded goodwill is subjected to annual impairment testing  unless significant changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred sooner 
goodwill impairment testing requires  in part  that we estimate the fair value of our business units which  in turn  requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates for those businesses 
fair values are established using comparative market multiples market approach in the current market conditions and discounted cash flows income approach 
for purposes of applying the sfas test  we have historically relied primarily on the income approach  because it considers factors unique to each of our businesses and related long range plans that may not be comparable to other businesses 
the discount rates used are based on the weighted average cost of capital determined for each of the company s reporting units and ranged from to in in addition we make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in determining market multiples in valuing our business units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate values for each of our business units 
we also compare our book value and the estimates of fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of and at dates near the annual testing date 
management uses this comparison as additional evidence of the fair value of the company  as our market capitalization may be suppressed by other factors such as the control premium associated with a controlling shareholder  our leverage or general expectations regarding future operating results and cash flows 
in situations where the implied value of the company under the income or market approach are significantly different than our market capitalization we re evaluate and adjust  if necessary  the assumptions underlying our income and market approach models 
our estimate of the fair values of these business units and the related goodwill  could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the aggregate market value of the company s common stock  actual operating performance of the underlying businesses or the impact of future events on the cost of capital and the related discount rates used 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

sfas no 
requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency were settled for an amount greater than our estimates  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency were settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries as it is our intention to reinvest such earnings for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states and in jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than in the united states 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities and expense to be recognized 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on all available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all 
table of contents sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates 
also  significant judgment is required in determining the company s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties under fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available
