there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate 
all comments concerning our expectations for future revenues and operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions 
these forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control and assumptions 
they are subject to change based upon various factors including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described in item a of this annual report on form k

we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
introduction argan  inc the company  we  us  or our conducts operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries  gemma power systems  llc and affiliates gps that we acquired in december  vitarich laboratories  inc vli that we acquired in august  and southern maryland cable  inc smc that we acquired in july through gps  we provide a full range of development  consulting  engineering  procurement  construction  commissioning  operations and maintenance services to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including public utilities  independent power project owners  municipalities  public institutions and private industry 
through vli  we develop  manufacture and distribute premium nutritional products 
through smc  we provide telecommunications infrastructure services including project management  construction and maintenance to the federal government  telecommunications and broadband service providers as well as electric utilities 
each of the wholly owned subsidiaries represents a separate reportable segment power industry services  nutritional products and telecommunications infrastructure services  respectively 
overview and outlook for the fiscal year ended january   consolidated net revenues were million which represented an increase of million  or  over net revenues of million for the prior year 
net income for the fiscal year ended january  was million  or per diluted share 
we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share for the fiscal year ended january  we increased our balance of cash and cash equivalents during the current year by million to million at january  the increase in net revenues between years was due primarily to an increase in the net revenues of the power industry services business  which represented of consolidated net revenues for the current fiscal year  offset partially by decreases in the net revenues of the telecommunications infrastructure and nutritional products businesses 
primarily due to the addition during the current year of the two contracts to construct power generation facilities in california  the contract backlog of gps increased to million at january  from million at january  income from operations improved in the fiscal year ended january  to million  we incurred a loss from operations of million in the fiscal year ended january  several significant factors were reflected in this improvement including a favorable adjustment made to cost of revenues in the amount of million related to the settlement by gps of accrued amounts on a terminated construction contract  the reduction between years in amortization expense related to the purchased intangible assets in the amount of million  and a million decrease between years in impairment losses 
in addition  the prior year results included a million loss on a completed power plant contract 
however  both smc and vli incurred losses from operations in the current fiscal year due primarily to reductions in the annual net revenues of both companies and inventory losses of million recorded by vli in the current year 
corporate expenses increased between years due primarily to an increase in stock option compensation expense of  and an increase in legal expenses of  relating to the wfc and thomas matters discussed in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents during the current fiscal year  we raised approximately million in net cash proceeds from the private placement sale of shares of our common stock 
however  our operating activities used million cash in the current year  due primarily to a million decrease in the balance of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
we reduced our long term debt by million to a balance of million 
this long term debt amount represented only and of total stockholders equity and consolidated total assets as of january   respectively 
our business is not capital equipment intensive 
although our businesses made capital expenditures totaling  in the current year  the balance of net fixed assets represented less than of consolidated total assets at january  during the current fiscal year  we also used cash to make million in additional payments due to the former owners of gps and to make a million investment in grp 
including the performance of work included in the contract backlog of gps and grp at january   we expect to continue the growth of the company s consolidated net revenues in the next fiscal year and to report operating results that are profitable and that include net cash provided by operations 
however  current economic conditions in the us  including a deepening recession and severe disruptions in the credit markets  could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods  particularly if the economic recession is prolonged or if government efforts to stabilize financial institutions  to restore order to credit markets  to stimulate spending and to arrest rising unemployment are not effective 
the current instability in the financial markets may make it difficult for certain of our customers  particularly for projects funded by private investment  to access the credit markets to obtain financing for new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
although our construction project backlog has increased in the current fiscal year  we may encounter increased levels of deferrals and delays related to new construction projects in the future 
difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets may significantly increase the rate at which our customers defer  delay or cancel proposed new construction projects 
such deferrals  delays or cancellations could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
for example  the inability of a customer to obtain financing for the completion of an ethanol production facility resulted in the current year termination of our engineering  procurement and construction services contract and the reduction of approximately million in backlog 
we anticipate that the increased political focus on energy independence and the negative environmental impact of fossil fuels may spur the development of alternative and renewable power facilities which should result in new power facility opportunities for us in the future 
more than half of the states have adopted formal green energy goals and federal support for infrastructure spending remains strong 
an energy infrastructure renewal program is included in the us government economic stimulus package  making funds available for water and energy projects and including tax incentives to encourage capital investment in renewable energy sources 
in order to capitalize on emerging opportunities in a portion of this market  we formed a joint venture with a wind energy development firm in june for the purpose of constructing wind energy farms for project owners 
the venture has received an initial limited notice to proceed on a project to design and build the expansion of a wind farm in illinois 
we are nearing the completion of the construction of a biodiesel production plant in texas  the fourth such project that we will complete within a two year period  and are pursuing other alternative fuel production opportunities 
moreover  we continue to observe renewed interest in gas fired generation as electric utilities and independent power producers look to diversify their generation options 
we believe that the initiatives in many states to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  and utilities desire to fill demand for additional power prior to the completion of more sizeable or controversial projects  are also stimulating renewed demand for gas fired power plants 
as described above  both the colusa and sentinel power projects are gas fired electricity generation plants 
while it is unclear what the impact of current economic conditions might have on the timing or financing of such future projects  we expect that gas fired power plants will continue to be an important component of long term power generation development in the us and believe our capabilities and expertise will position us as a market leader for these projects 
in summary  it is uncertain what impacts the current recession and financial credit crisis in the us may have on our business 
we are continuously alert for effects of this crisis that may be impacting our business currently and any new developments that may affect us going forward 
moreover  the continuing global uncertainty and deteriorating economic conditions may impair our visibility to an unusual degree 
current or deteriorating future conditions could potentially lead to the delay  curtailment or cancellation of proposed and existing projects  thus decreasing the overall demand for our services  adversely impacting our results of operations and weakening our financial condition 
nevertheless  we remain cautiously optimistic about our long term growth opportunities 
we are focused on expanding our position in the growing power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of increasing electricity demand covering decades into the future 
we believe that our expectations are reasonable and that our future plans are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  such forward looking statements  by their nature  involve risks and uncertainties  and they should be considered conjunction with the risk factors included in item a of this annual report on form k 

table of contents comparison of the results of operations for the years ended january  and the following schedule compares the results of our operations for the years ended january  and except where noted  the percentage amounts represent the percentage of net revenues for the corresponding year 
as analyzed below the schedule  we reported net income of million for the fiscal year ended january   or per diluted share 
for the fiscal year ended january   we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share 
net revenues power industry services nutritional products telecommunications infrastructure services net revenues cost of revenues power industry services nutritional products telecommunications infrastructure services cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment losses income loss from operations interest expense investment income equity in net income of unconsolidated subsidiary income loss from operations before income taxes income tax expense net income loss less than 
the cost of revenues percentage amounts represent the percentage of net revenues of the applicable segment 
net revenues power industry services net revenues of power industry services were million for the year ended january   and represented of consolidated net revenues 
for the fiscal year ended january   the net revenues of the power industry services business were million  which represented of consolidated net revenues 
our energy plant construction contract backlog was million at january   not including the backlog of grp in the amount of million see the discussion of our investment in this unconsolidated subsidiary below 
the comparable construction contract backlog was million at january  
table of contents two significant customers of the power industry services business for the current year represented approximately and of the net revenues of this business segment for the current year  respectively  and represented approximately and of our consolidated net revenues for the current year  respectively 
in the aggregate  four significant customers of the power industry services business represented approximately of its net revenues for the year ended january  individually  the four customers represented approximately   and of the net revenues of this business segment for the prior year  respectively  and they represented approximately   and of our consolidated net revenues for the prior fiscal year  respectively 
the projects for three of these four customers have been completed  one project was terminated during the current year as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
projects completed by gps over the last two years included the construction of biodiesel production facilities in texas  a gas fired energy power plant in california  and a gas fired peaking power facility in connecticut 
in may  we announced that gps signed an engineering  procurement and construction agreement with pacific gas electric company pg e in the amount of million for the design and construction of a natural gas fired power plant in colusa  california 
this energy plant is planned to be a megawatt combined cycle facility and construction is expected to be completed in we announced the receipt from pg e of a full notice to proceed on this project in october gps commenced activity on this project in the fourth quarter ended january  under an interim notice to proceed that it received from pg e in december in october  we announced that gps signed an engineering  procurement and construction agreement and received a limited notice to proceed from competitive power ventures inc cpv to design and build the sentinel power project 
this project  valued at million  consists of eight simple cycle gas fired peaking plants with a total power rating of megawatts to be located in southern california 
the project is currently expected to be completed in cpv has a power supply agreement with southern california edison 
telecommunications infrastructure services net revenues of telecommunications infrastructure services were approximately million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january   representing a decrease in the net revenues of telecommunications infrastructure services between years of approximately million  or 
the net revenues of telecommunications services for the years ended january  and were and of consolidated net revenues for the corresponding years  respectively 
net revenues related to inside premises customers increased by approximately for the year ended january  compared with the prior year due to increases in revenues related to eds and other customers 
however  this strong performance was more than offset by a reduction between years in the net revenues related to outside plant customers 
although smc signed a new eighteen month contract with verizon during the current year and net revenues related to this customer recovered gradually during the current year  the level of business from this customer declined between years 
work performed for smc s other large outside plant customer also decreased between years 
nutritional products the net revenues from the sale of nutritional products by vli were million for the fiscal year ended january   and represented of consolidated net revenues 
the net revenues from the sale of nutritional products were million for the fiscal year ended january  this amount represented of consolidated net revenues for the prior year 
the decrease in the net revenues of nutritional products was million  or 
the decrease primarily was due to the loss of several large customers and lower than expected sales of products  in the aggregate  to vli s largest current customers during the current year  resulting in net sales declines between fiscal years of million and million  respectively 
vli is primarily a contract manufacturer of nutritional products 
the ability to quickly replace lost customers or to increase the product offerings sold to existing customers is hampered by the long sales cycle inherent in our type of business 
the length of time between the beginning of contract negotiation and the first sale to a new customer could exceed six months including extended periods of product testing and acceptance 
cost of revenues on a consolidated basis and expressed as a percentage of net revenues  our cost of revenues decreased to for the year ended january  compared with for the prior year 
our overall gross profit increased by million  or  to million for the current fiscal year from last year 
our gross profit percentage increased to for the current year from for the prior year 
the gross profit improvements were due to the current year performance of gps 
the cost of revenues for the power industry services business of gps increased in the fiscal year ended january  to million from million in the fiscal year ended january  the cost of revenues as a percentage of corresponding net revenues was for the current year compared with last year 
the gross profit of gps for the current year was favorably affected by the adjustment to cost of revenues in the net amount of million that is discussed below and the recognition in net revenues of earned incentive fees related to construction services that totaled approximately million 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended january   gps recorded favorable adjustments related to the settlement of accrued amounts on a terminated construction contract that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the adjustments reduced cost of revenues for the fiscal year ended january  by approximately million  net of related expenses 
cost of revenues for the telecommunication infrastructure services business of smc decreased by  or approximately  in the current year compared with the prior year  but increased slightly as a percentage of corresponding net revenues to in the current year from last year 
on an overall basis  direct labor and related costs were reduced between the years by million 
despite increased inside plant work causing increases of  and  between fiscal years in costs incurred for subcontractors and job supplies  respectively  the profitability of the inside plant work improved between the years 
on the other hand  the effects of reduced net revenues and competitive pricing pressures decreased the profit of the outside plant work between the years 
although the cost of revenues for the nutritional products business of vli decreased in the year ended january  by million to million from million in the year ended january   the cost of revenues expressed as a percentage of corresponding net revenues increased to in the current year from a percentage of last year 
the cost of revenues for the current year included a total provision for obsolete and overstocked inventory of million which represented of current year net revenues 
the comparable provision amount for the prior fiscal year was  in addition  the declining sales and competitive product pricing pressures continued to squeeze gross margins and increased the recurring cost of excess production capacity 
direct labor and related manufacturing overhead costs were reduced between years by  and  or and  respectively 
however  the reductions did not occur in proportion to the reduction in net revenues between fiscal years 
selling  general and administrative expenses these expenses decreased to million  or of consolidated net revenues  for the fiscal year ended january  from million  or of consolidated net revenues  for the fiscal year ended january   a reduction of million  or 
amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets decreased by approximately million in the current year period compared with last year as the amortization expense related to contractual and other customer relationships decreased between years by approximately million 
most of this decrease was scheduled and attributable to backlog for construction contracts completed by gps last year 
the impairment losses recorded by vli last year served to reduce its amortization expense related to customer relationships and the noncompete agreement prospectively  and the amortization of propriety formulas was completed last year 
partially offsetting the favorable effects of the amortization expense reductions in the current year and reductions in expenses at gps and vli were increases in certain corporate expenses 
stock option compensation expense increased between years by  and legal costs and fees  related primarily to the wfc and kevin thomas matters  increased by  between years 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets as discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded impairment losses in the current fiscal year related to purchased intangible and fixed assets of vli in the aggregate amount of million and related to purchased intangible assets of smc in the amount of million 
these amounts are included in the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended january  the statement of operations for the fiscal year ended january  included vli impairment losses related to goodwill and other purchased intangible assets in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
through scheduled depreciation and amortization for the long lived assets and the impairment losses recorded by vli during the current and prior years  the carrying values of the goodwill  other purchased intangible assets and fixed assets of vli have been substantially eliminated 
likewise  the carrying values goodwill and the contractual customer relationships of smc were eliminated by the impairment losses recorded in the current year 
other income and expense our investment income includes primarily amounts received monthly on excess cash balances invested in liquid collective funds offered by the bank 
we reported investment income of million for the fiscal year ended january  compared to investment income of million for the year ended january   reflecting the significant decline in short term investment returns over the last year 
interest expense  which relates primarily to two bank term loans  declined to  in the current year from  last year due to the overall reduction in the level of debt between years 
in june  we announced that gps has entered into a business partnership for the design and construction of wind energy farms located in the united states and canada 
the business partners each own of the new company  grp  which has begun a construction project to expand a wind farm in lasalle county  illinois with the addition of wind turbines 
our share of the net income of grp for the current fiscal year was approximately  
table of contents income tax expense for the fiscal year ended january   we incurred income tax expense of million representing an effective income tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for the current year differs from the expected federal income tax rate of due primarily to the effect of state income taxes and the unfavorable net effect of permanent differences  in particular the impairment losses of approximately million related to the goodwill of vli and smc that are not deductible for income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  we established a valuation allowance during the current year related to the deferred state taxes of vli in the amount of  the unfavorable effects of these factors were offset partially in the current year by the favorable effect of a credit to the deferred tax provision in the approximate amount of  reflecting the effect of the current year change in state income tax rates applied to our deferred tax items 
despite reporting a loss before income taxes of million for the year ended january   we incurred income tax expense of approximately million for the year 
the prior year goodwill impairment loss related to vli of approximately million was not deductible for income tax reporting purposes  and represented a permanent difference between financial and income tax reporting 
in addition  we were adversely impacted by our inability to utilize certain current operating losses for state income tax reporting purposes 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased during the current year by approximately million to approximately million as of january  compared to million as of january  due primarily to the addition of the net proceeds of the private placement sale of common stock completed in july at january   cash equivalents included investments in collective funds managed by the bank that invest primarily in debt securities issued or guaranteed by the federal government 
our consolidated working capital increased during the current year from approximately million as of january  to approximately million as of january  we also have an available balance of million under our revolving line of credit financing arrangement with the bank 
during the current year  we reached agreement with the bank extending the availability of the revolving line of credit to may although we reported net income of approximately million for the current fiscal year and our net non cash expenses were approximately million  we used net cash of million in operations 
we experienced unfavorable changes between years in the amounts of several operating asset and liability accounts 
during the current fiscal year  the decrease in the amount of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represented a million use of cash as we approached completion of the construction of two biodiesel plants in texas 
the million increase in the amount of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings during the current year was due to the ramp up in activity related to the construction of a gas fired power plant in california 
additionally  an increase in accounts receivable during the current fiscal year used million in cash with most of this amount provided by an increase in the amount of outstanding contract accounts receivable of gps 
cash was provided during the current year as million was released from escrow accounts as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  an increase in the combined amount of accounts payable and accrued expenses provided approximately million in cash 
the significant items included in our non cash expenses for the current year were impairment losses of million  amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets of million  stock option compensation expense of million and depreciation and other amortization of  as identified in note to the consolidated financial statements  a non cash transaction resulted in reductions to accounts receivable and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings in the amount of million 
for the fiscal year ended january   despite a net loss of million  net cash provided by operations was million 
the net amount of non cash expenses in the prior year  including impairment losses of million and the amortization of purchased intangible assets in the amount of million  was approximately million 
billings in excess of cost and earnings provided approximately million in cash flow due primarily to an increase in cash collections as a result of a growth in operating activity 
in addition  the company reduced the amount of unbilled receivables during the prior fiscal year by approximately million 
cash was used as accounts receivable rose by approximately million last year 
cash was also used to reduce the level of accounts payable and accrued expenses by approximately million during the prior year 
during the fiscal year ended january   investing activities consisted of the payment of million in contingent acquisition price to the former owners of gps see note to the consolidated financial statements and the capital contributions of million made to grp in connection with the formation and start up of this unconsolidated subsidiary 
we also purchased equipment with a net cost of  during the current year 
during the year ended january   net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million 
the sale of investments provided net cash of million 
we used approximately  in cash to purchase equipment and other fixed assets 

table of contents net cash of approximately million was provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended january  we completed the private placement sale of million shares of our common stock in july  providing net cash proceeds of approximately million  and issued approximately  shares of our common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and warrants  providing net cash proceeds of approximately  we used cash to make debt principal payments of million 
for the year ended january   net cash used in financing activities was approximately million  including primarily monthly debt installment payments 
we also received cash proceeds of  during the year from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common stock 
the bank financing arrangements provide for the measurement at our fiscal year end and at each of our fiscal quarter ends using a rolling month period of certain financial covenants including requirements that the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda  as defined therein  not exceed to  that the ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda  as defined  not exceed to  and that the fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than to at january  and  we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants 
the bank s consent is required for acquisitions and divestitures 
we continue to pledge the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements 
the bank financing arrangements contain an acceleration clause which allows the bank to declare amounts outstanding under the financing arrangements due and payable if it determines in good faith that a material adverse change has occurred in the financial condition of any of our companies 
we believe that we will continue to comply with the financial covenants under the financing arrangement 
if our performance results in non compliance with any of the financial covenants  or if the bank seeks to exercise its rights under the acceleration clause referred to above  we would seek to modify the financing arrangement  but there can be no assurance that the bank would not exercise their rights and remedies under the financing arrangement including accelerating payment of all outstanding senior debt due and payable 
during the current year  we demonstrated an ability to acquire growth capital despite soft capital markets as we raised approximately million in net cash proceeds from the private placement sale of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we will use these proceeds to maintain an increased level of working capital liquidity in support of the growth of gps  particularly to meet the increasing liquidity requirements of construction bond providers as the size of our construction contracts increases 
including the cash raised in the private placement transaction  excess cash at january  in the aggregate amount of million was invested in a government reserve money market fund sponsored by an investment division of the bank 
the fund invests in high quality  first tier  money market investments with at least of its net assets including us government and us treasury obligations 
operating bank accounts are maintained with bank of america 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash generated from our future operations and funds available under our line of credit will be adequate to meet our operating cash needs in the foreseeable future 
however  any future acquisitions  or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  significant dilution to the existing stockholders may result 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization non gaap measurement we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure  the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions 
further  we believe that ebitda is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance 

table of contents the following table presents the determinations of ebitda for the years ended january  and ebitda years ended january  net income loss  as reported interest expense income tax expense depreciation and other amortization amortization of purchased intangible assets ebitda as ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  the results of our operations presented in accordance with gaap that are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our ebitda does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as we believe that our net cash flow from operations is the most directly comparable performance measure determined in accordance with gaap  the following table reconciles the amounts of ebitda for the applicable periods  as presented above  to the corresponding amounts of net cash flows provided by used in operating activities that are presented in on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
reconciliations of ebitda years ended january  ebitda current income tax expense interest expense impairment losses related to goodwill and other purchased intangible assets non cash stock option compensation expense provision for inventory obsolescence equity in net income of unconsolidated subsidiary decrease in escrowed cash increase in accounts receivable  net change related to the timing of scheduled billings other  net net cash used in provided by operations off balance sheet arrangements as of january   the company s off balance sheet arrangements  as that term is described by the securities and exchange commission  included a million standby letter of credit issued to support our bonding capacity provided by an insurance company 
the letter of credit was issued by our bank and renews annually effective january seasonality the operations of our power industry and telecommunications infrastructure services segments are expected to have seasonally weaker results in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year  and may produce stronger results in the second and third quarters 
this seasonality is primarily due to the effect of winter weather on outside plant activities as well as reduced daylight hours 
the significance of seasonality on gps depends on the geographic regions in which gps contracts are located in any given year 

table of contents inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivables  and our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture  and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and benefits  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long term construction contracts  the valuation of goodwill and long lived assets  income tax reporting and the reporting of legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in making estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we recognize a significant portion of revenues in connection with performance under long term construction contracts pursuant to statement of position sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the types of contracts may vary and include agreements under which revenues are based on a fixed price basis or cost plus fee 
revenues from cost plus fee construction agreements are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned  measured using the cost to cost method 
revenues from fixed price construction agreements  including portions of estimated profit  are recognized as services are provided  based on costs incurred and estimated total contract costs using the percentage of completion method 
therefore  changes to the total estimated contract cost of a fixed price contract may affect the amount of profit or the extent of loss 
the effect of the change on profit or loss is recorded in the period when the change in estimated total contract cost is determined 
we review the estimates of total cost on each significant contract monthly 
in connection with the acquisitions of gps  vli and smc  we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships  proprietary formulas  non compete agreements and trade names 
other than goodwill  most of our purchased intangible assets are determined to have finite useful lives 
at february   the beginning of our most recent fiscal year  goodwill and other purchased intangible assets together represented approximately of consolidated total assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas no 
 the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually 
the company tests for the impairment of goodwill pursuant to the requirements of fas no 
and of the other purchased intangible assets pursuant to the requirements of fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset value might be impaired 
we utilize the assistance of professional appraisal firms in the initial determination of the fair value of these intangible assets using various techniques 
certain techniques require us to make estimates and assumptions about the future financial performance of the acquired businesses that may change in the future 
the declining sales and the operating losses experienced by vli during the last two years indicated that the carrying values of vli s goodwill and long lived assets was impaired 
accordingly  the company performed assessments of the carrying values and determined that the net unadjusted carrying values of these assets exceeded the current fair values 
accordingly  we recorded asset impairment losses related to vli in the total amounts of million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
as of january  and  our consolidated balance sheets included deferred tax assets in the total amounts of million and million  respectively  resulting from our future deductible temporary differences 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if such estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
at this time  based substantially on the strong earnings performance of our power industry services business segment  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several legal matters relating to vli where litigation has been initiated against us 
we deny the alleged wrongdoings and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in each case 
management does not believe that a material loss is reasonably possible related to the lawsuits in the kevin thomas litigation  individually or in the aggregate 
however  we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter 
should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change  losses or additional costs may be recorded 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory obsolescence 
a description of the company s significant accounting policies  including those discussed above  are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb announced the issuance of fasb staff position fsp fas and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities 
this fsp requires public entities to provide additional disclosures until proposed fasb statements  accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
and amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  become effective 
this fsp was effective for our consolidated financials statements for the fiscal year ending january  however  it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue  equity method investment accounting considerations 
this issue clarifies the accounting for some transactions and impairment considerations involving all investments accounted for under the equity method 
guidance is provided regarding how the initial carrying value of an equity investment should be determined  how an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinite lived intangible asset of an equity method investment should be performed  how an equity method investee s issuance of shares should be accounted for and  how to account for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method
