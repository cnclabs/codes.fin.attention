item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group  whose companies design  engineer  manufacture and sell a wide range of proprietary and build to print components  assemblies and systems for the global aerospace oem market  and ii triumph aftermarket services group  whose companies serve aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the maintenance  repair and overhaul of aircraft components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
financial highlights for the fiscal year ended march  include net sales for fiscal increased to billion 
operating income in fiscal increased to million 
net income for fiscal increased to million 
backlog increased over the prior year to billion 
for the fiscal year ended march   net sales totaled billion  a increase from fiscal year net sales of billion 
net income for fiscal year increased to million  or per diluted common share  versus million  or per diluted common share  for fiscal year as discussed in further detail below under results of operations  the increase in net income is attributable to the increased sales  including the contribution from recent acquisitions and reduced expenses  particularly for litigation and incentive compensation 
our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flows from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
we continue to remain focused on growing our core businesses as well as growing through strategic acquisitions 
our organic growth remained strong in fiscal through the addition of products and services  the expansion of our operating capacity and marketing our complete portfolio of capabilities  while benefiting from the continued strength in the aerospace markets generally 
our core revenue growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal  excluding the impact of acquisitions  was  which was negatively impacted by the boeing strike and major program delays particularly in boeing s and programs  partially offset by a favorable settlement of a retroactive pricing agreement 
our company has an aggressive but selective acquisition approach that adds capabilities and increases our capacity for strong and consistent internal growth 
in march  we acquired merritt tool company  inc now triumph structures east texas  saygrove defence aerospace group limited now triumph actuation motion control systems uk  the aviation segment of kongsberg automotive holdings asa now triumph controls u 
k and triumph controls germany and the mexmil company  llc now triumph insulation systems  collectively the fiscal acquisitions 
in february  we acquired the assets and business of b 
r 
machine tool corp 
b r through a newly organized  wholly owned subsidiary of the company  triumph structures long island  llc 
the results for the fiscal acquisitions and triumph structures long island  llc are included in the company s aerospace systems segment 

table of contents outlook based upon the assumptions about our market set forth below  and subject to the risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we expect net sales for the fiscal year ending march  to be in the range of billion to billion  and earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal of approximately per diluted share 
the fiscal outlook assumes  among other factors  a full year effective tax rate of 
the outlook for earnings per share is based on a fully diluted share count of million shares 
our fiscal outlook is based on the following market assumptions we expect the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry to remain extremely competitive 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share  and traditional airlines continue to improve their competitive position by lowering their cost structure through merger  bankruptcy and restructuring 
some of the airline restructurings have led to increased outsourcing opportunities  benefiting our aftermarket services segment 
the financial health of the commercial airline industry has a direct effect on our commercial aircraft programs 
while challenges include volatile fuel prices  customers rescheduling orders and continuing turmoil in global credit markets  airlines are responding by focusing on controlling non fuel related expenses and implementing operational efficiencies 
based upon currently available market forecasts  we expect aircraft seat miles  a key indicator of airline health  to decline to as airlines attempt to match capacity with air travel demand 
deliveries of boeing and airbus large commercial aircraft are expected to be higher in calendar compared to calendar  due to the effect of the boeing strike in calendar boeing and airbus reported actual deliveries for calendar of aircraft 
their deliveries for calendar are expected to increase by approximately  to about aircraft 
our outlook is based on boeing s and airbus current projected production rates 
military sales oem and aftermarket are expected to increase roughly in line with global military budgets  which are expected to grow in the single digit range for calendar compared to calendar the major trends that shape the current military defense environment include a growing us government defense budget 
although under pressure  the us defense budget remains strong and focused on transformation 
with this continued pressure on the budget  we believe the us department of defense will continue to focus on affordable strategies in particular  programs currently in production  which would include continued significant investment in rotocraft 
total regional and business aircraft production is expected to decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal  as deliveries of business jets are expected to significantly decrease  along with the increase in pre owned business jet inventory 
in the regional aircraft market we expect to see declines impacted by the drop in passenger traffic and the rescheduling of deliveries 
we expect a weakened air cargo market  which is a key market segment for our aftermarket services group given our product penetration with these carriers 
results of operations the following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations 
the company s diverse structure and customer base do not provide for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results 
however  we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods

machine tool corp 
now triumph structures long island together contributed million 
excluding the effects of this acquisition  organic sales growth was million  or  which was negatively impacted by the boeing strike and major program delays particularly in the and programs  partially offset by a favorable settlement of a retroactive pricing agreement 
the aerospace systems segment benefited primarily from increased sales to our oem customers driven by increased military aircraft build rates  while the increase in sales for our aftermarket services segment was the result of increased demand for our services due to growth in global air traffic 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase includes the acquisitions noted above  which contributed million 
excluding the effects of these acquisitions  gross margin was for the fiscal year ended march   compared with for the fiscal year ended march  despite having consistent consolidated gross margin  the gross margin for our aerospace systems segment was favorably impacted by contribution from the acquisition of b 
r 
machine tool company and the favorable settlement of a retroactive pricing agreement  whereas the gross margin for our aftermarket services segment was negatively impacted by charges due to contract terminations million and changes in estimate under power by the hour contracts million as well as losses at our phoenix apu facility due to cost overruns and excess overhead million and higher than expected warranty expenses million 
segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income growth was a direct result of margins attained on increased sales as described above  the contribution of million from the above mentioned acquisitions  and decreases in litigation costs million and incentive compensation million  partially offset by increases in payroll million and depreciation and amortization expenses million associated with our acquisitions 
corporate expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to increased healthcare million  stock compensation costs million and the write off of acquisition costs 
table of contents on a potential acquisition that was not consummated million  partially offset by decreases in litigation costs million 
interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million for the prior year 
during fiscal  the company entered into certain foreign currency derivative instruments that did not meet hedge accounting criteria and primarily were intended to protect against exposure related to fiscal acquisitions 
these instruments resulted in a gain of million in fiscal  which is included in interest expense and other 
in addition to this gain  the decrease in interest expense was impacted by declining interest rates 
also during fiscal  the company paid million to purchase million of principal on the convertible senior subordinated notes  resulting in a gain on early extinguishment of million 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the research and experimentation tax credit back to january  loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for the fiscal year ended march   compared with a loss from discontinued operations before income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended march   which included an impairment charge of million 
the income tax benefit for discontinued operations was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a benefit of million for the prior year

r 
machine tool corp 
now triumph structures long island together contributed million 
after considering the effects of these acquisitions  organic sales growth of million  or  accounted for the remaining increase 
organic sales growth was due to increased sales to our oem customers of million driven by increased aircraft build rates within our aerospace systems segment  while the increase in sales for our aftermarket services segment of million was the result of increased demand for our services  as a result of growth in global air traffic and market share gain 

table of contents cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase includes the acquisitions noted above  which contributed million  offset by an insurance reimbursement million related to product liability claims 
excluding the effects of these acquisitions and insurance reimbursement  gross margin was for the fiscal year ended march   compared with for the fiscal year ended march  segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income growth was a direct result of the margins attained on increased sales volume as described above approximating million  and the contribution of million from the above mentioned acquisitions  partially offset by incurred increases in litigation costs million due to developments discussed under legal proceedings  increases in payroll million  incentive compensation million  and healthcare million to match our operating needs due to increased sales levels  and increases in depreciation and amortization expenses million due to increased capital additions and intangibles acquired in business combinations 
corporate expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to increased litigation costs million due to developments addressed under legal proceedings and increased workers compensation million and incentive compensation costs million to match our operating needs due to increased sales levels  partially offset by an insurance reimbursement of million related to product liability claims 
interest expense and other increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million for the prior year period 
this increase was due to higher average borrowings outstanding and amortization of debt issuance costs  partially offset by lower interest on our convertible notes issued in september as compared to the previously outstanding class a senior notes and class b senior notes collectively  the senior notes 
during the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge for early extinguishment of debt totaling million related to the prepayment of the senior notes on october   which included a make whole premium of approximately million and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes of million 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to final return to provision adjustments 
additionally  both rates vary from the federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to benefits realized from the research and development tax credit and the domestic production activities deduction 
loss from discontinued operations before income taxes was million for the fiscal year ended march   which included an impairment charge of million  compared with a loss from discontinued operations before income taxes of million for the fiscal year ended march  the income tax benefit for discontinued operations was million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a benefit of million for the prior year 
business segment performance we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have two operating segments i triumph aerospace systems group and ii triumph aftermarket services group 
our aerospace systems segment includes operating locations  and the aftermarket services segment includes operating locations at march  the results of operations between our operating segments vary due to differences in competitors  customers  extent of proprietary deliverables and performance 
for example  
table of contents our aerospace systems segment generally includes proprietary products and or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers  where our unique manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin 
also  oems are increasingly focusing on assembly activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and repair to third parties  and as a result  are less of a competitive force than in previous years 
in contrast  our aftermarket services segment provides maintenance  repair and overhaul mro services on components and accessories manufactured by third parties  with more diverse competition  including airlines  oems and other third party service providers 
in addition  variability in the timing and extent of customer requests performed in the aftermarket services segment can provide for greater volatility in revenue and earnings than that experienced in the aerospace systems segment 
the aerospace systems segment consists of the company s operations which manufacture products primarily for the aerospace oem market 
the aerospace systems segment s operations design and engineer mechanical and electromechanical controls  such as hydraulic systems and components  main engine gearbox assemblies  accumulators and mechanical control cables 
the aerospace systems segment s revenues are also derived from stretch forming  die forming  milling  bonding  machining  welding and assembly and fabrication of various structural components used in aircraft wings  fuselages and other significant assemblies 
further  the segment s operations also design and manufacture composite assemblies for floor panels  environmental control system ducts and non structural cockpit components 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aftermarket services segment consists of the company s operations that provide maintenance  repair and overhaul services to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
maintenance  repair and overhaul revenues are derived from services on auxiliary power units  airframe and engine accessories  including constant speed drives  cabin compressors  starters and generators  and pneumatic drive units 
in addition  the aftermarket services segment s operations repair and overhaul thrust reversers  nacelle components and flight control surfaces 
the aftermarket services segment s operations also perform repair and overhaul services and supply spare parts for various types of cockpit instruments and gauges for a broad range of commercial airlines on a worldwide basis 
we currently generate a majority of our revenue from clients in the commercial aerospace industry  the military  and the regional airline industry 
our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services from clients in these industries 
if any of these industries experiences a downturn  our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us 
the following table summarizes our net sales by end market by business segment

aftermarket services segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income increased primarily due to margins attained on increased sales volume and the contribution from the acquisition of triumph accessory services grand prairie  inc partially offset by increases in incentive compensation  write offs of bad debt and depreciation and amortization expenses 
aftermarket services segment operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with for the fiscal year ended march   due to the full year contributions from the acquisition of triumph accessory services grand prairie  inc and the expansion of our operations in our thailand repair and maintenance facility 
in addition  we experienced improved operating margins on our apu and nacelle components businesses due to increased efficiencies as a result of higher sales volumes 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
during the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flow from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and generated approximately million in financing activities 
during the fiscal year ended march   our increased cash flow from operations was attributable to higher net income and an improved performance on working capital due to increased cash collections efforts  offset by timing of cash disbursements and utilization of inventory 

table of contents on july   we amended the existing amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility with our lenders primarily to allow for a receivable securitization facility of up to million and amend certain other terms and covenants

amounts repaid under the credit facility may be reborrowed 
in august  we entered into a receivable securitization facility the securitization facility 
under the securitization facility  the company sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to triumph receivables  llc  a wholly owned special purpose entity  which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions 
the company is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the securitization facility 
as of march   the maximum amount available under the securitization facility was million 
the securitization facility is due to expire in august and is subject to annual renewal through august interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short term commercial paper plus a program fee and a commitment fee 
the program fee is basis points on the amount outstanding under the securitization facility 
additionally  the commitment fee is basis points on of the maximum amount available under the securitization facility 
at march   there was million outstanding under the securitization facility included in the current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
we use this facility because it offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 
the company securitizes its accounts receivable  which are generally non interest bearing  in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the agreement governing the securitization facility contains restrictions and covenants which include limitations on the making of certain restricted payments  creation of certain liens  and certain corporate acts such as mergers  consolidations and the sale of substantially all assets 
in march  we acquired merritt tool company  inc now triumph structures east texas  saygrove defence aerospace group limited now triumph actuation motion control systems uk  the aviation segment of kongsberg automotive holdings asa now triumph controls uk and triumph controls germany and the mexmil company  llc now triumph insulation systems  collectively the fiscal acquisitions 
no in process research and development was attributed to the fiscal acquisitions 
the total cash paid at closing for the fiscal acquisitions of million was funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
the fiscal acquisitions further provide for deferred payments of million  of which million and million are payable in march and september  respectively 
the fiscal acquisitions also provide for contingent payments of million  certain of which are contingent upon the achievement of specified earnings levels during the earnout period and another million that is contingent upon entering into a specific customer contract 
the maximum earnout amounts payable in respect of fiscal   and are million  million  million and million  respectively 
the contingent amounts have not been recorded as the contingencies have not been resolved and the consideration has not been paid 
also in march  we entered into a year master lease agreement the leasing facility creating a capital lease of certain existing property and equipment  resulting in net proceeds of  after deducting debt issuance costs of approximately the net proceeds from the leasing facility were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
the debt issuance costs have been recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized over the term of the leasing facility 
the leasing facility bears interest at a weighted average fixed rate of per annum 

table of contents cash provided by operations for the fiscal year ended march  was million  compared to cash provided by operations of million for the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   our increased cash flow from operations was attributable to higher net income offset by a decline in performance on working capital  due to timing of cash collections and utilization of inventory offset by timing of cash disbursements

as a result  as of may   we remain able to purchase an additional  shares 
repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions  block purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prevailing prices 
no time limit has been set for completion of the program 
on september   we issued million in convertible senior subordinated notes the notes 
the notes are direct  unsecured  senior subordinated obligations of the company  and rank i junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  ii equal in right of payment with any other future senior subordinated indebtedness  and iii senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness 
the company received net proceeds from the sale of the notes of approximately million after deducting offering expenses of approximately million 
the use of the net proceeds from the sale was for prepayment of our outstanding senior notes  including a make whole premium  fees and expenses in connection with the prepayment  and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility

the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable in cash semi annually in arrears on each april and october beginning april  during the period commencing on october  and ending on  but excluding  april  and each six month period from october to march or from april to september thereafter  the company will pay contingent interest during the applicable interest period if the average trading price of a note for the five consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant six month period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes 
the contingent interest 
table of contents payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal per annum calculated on the average trading price of a note for the relevant five trading day period 
this contingent interest feature represents an embedded derivative 
since it is in the control of the company to call the notes at any time after october   the value of the derivative was determined to be de minimis 
accordingly  no value has been assigned at issuance or at march  the notes mature on october  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the company may redeem the notes for cash  either in whole or in part  anytime on or after october  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to but not including the date of redemption

the notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a rate equal to shares per  principal amount of the notes equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment as described in the indenture 
upon conversion  the company will deliver to the holder surrendering the notes for conversion  for each  principal amount of notes  an amount consisting of cash equal to the lesser of  and the company s total conversion obligation and  to the extent that the company s total conversion obligation exceeds  at the company s election  cash or shares of the company s common stock in respect of the remainder 
the notes are eligible for conversion upon meeting certain conditions as provided in the indenture agreement 
for the periods from october  through december  and january  through march   the notes were eligible for conversion  however  during this period  none of the notes were converted 
to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  the average price of the company s common stock for the fiscal year must exceed the conversion price per share of 
the average price of the company s stock for the fiscal year ended march  was  therefore  no additional shares were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation 
the average price of the company s stock for the fiscal year ended march  was 
accordingly   additional shares were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation 
no additional shares were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the fiscal year ended march  since the average price of the company s stock did not exceed the conversion price

we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of to million for our fiscal year ending march  the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity or replace old equipment at several facilities 
during the same period  we 
table of contents anticipate approximately million of start up costs related to the mexican facility which is in addition to our investment in capital and infrastructure 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands debt principal debt interest operating leases contingent payments purchase obligations total included in the company s balance sheet at march  includes fixed rate interest only 
includes contingent payments in connection with the fiscal acquisitions 
the above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits of million as of march  since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 
the table also excludes our pension benefit obligations 
we made pension contributions of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
these contributions include payments related to a supplemental executive retirement plan of zero and million in fiscal and  respectively  and payments to our union pension plans of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect to make pension contributions of million to our pension plans during fiscal as of march   our defined benefit pension plans are frozen 
see note  employee benefit plans of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our pension and other employee benefit plans 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisitions and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions is successfully consummated  the availability under the credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with the contract terms when products are shipped  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the aftermarket services segment provides repair and overhaul services  certain of which services are provided under long term power by the hour contracts 
the company applies the proportional performance method to recognize revenue under these contracts 
revenue is recognized over the contract period as units are delivered based on the relative fair value in proportion to the total estimated contract consideration 
in estimating the total contract consideration  we evaluate the projected utilization of our customer s fleet over the term of the contract  in connection with the related estimated repair and overhaul servicing requirements to the fleet based on such utilization 
changes in utilization of the fleet by our customers  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require adjustments to our estimates of revenue to be realized 
reserves for contract losses are accrued when estimated costs to complete exceed expected future revenues 
the company s policy with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances  except at the company s option 
accruals for sales returns  other allowances  and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time of shipment based upon past experience 
goodwill and intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the company s operating segments of aerospace systems and aftermarket services are also the reporting units under sfas no 
each operating segment has a president who is responsible for managing the segment and reporting to the president and ceo of the company  the company s chief operating decision maker codm  as defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
each of the operating segments is comprised of a number of operating units which are considered to be components under sfas no 
the operating units  for which discrete financial information exists  are aggregated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the company s acquisition strategy is to acquire companies that complement and enhance the 
table of contents capabilities of the operating segments of the company 
each acquisition is assigned to either the aerospace systems reporting unit or the aftermarket services reporting unit 
the goodwill that results from each acquisition is also assigned to the reporting unit to which the acquisition is allocated  because it is that reporting unit which is intended to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
sfas no 
requires a two step impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
for our impairment test  we use market multiples from an external source for an average of stock price to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for certain companies in the aerospace and defense markets in computing the fair value of each reporting unit 
in the event that market multiples for stock price to ebitda in the aerospace and defense markets decrease  or the expected ebitda for our reporting units decreases  a goodwill impairment charge may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
no impairment charges have been incurred since the adoption of sfas no 
intangible assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets is used to measure recoverability 
some of the more important factors we consider include our financial performance relative to our expected and historical performance  significant changes in the way we manage our operations  negative events that have occurred  and negative industry and economic trends 
if any impairment is indicated  measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset  generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  there were no reductions to the remaining useful lives and no write downs of long lived assets were required

forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and management s beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management s current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses

for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors affecting us  see the risk factors described in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including the credit facility 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
as of march   approximately of our debt is fixed rate debt 
our financing policy states that we generally maintain between and of our debt as fixed rate debt 
we anticipate that our fixed rate debt may exceed of our total debt during fiscal in march  the company entered into a thirty nine month interest rate swap to exchange floating rate for fixed rate interest payments to hedge against interest rate changes on million of the company s variable rate debt 
the company utilizes the swap to provide protection to meet actual exposures and does not speculate in derivatives 
the net effect of the spread between the floating rate day libor and the fixed rate will be reflected as an adjustment to interest expense in the period incurred 
for the fiscal year ended march   of losses were reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company estimates that million of losses presently in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings during fiscal year the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates 
fixed interest rates disclosed represent the weighted average rate as of march  variable interest rates disclosed fluctuate with the libor  federal funds rates and other weekly rates and represent the weighted average rate at march  expected years of maturity next months months months months months thereafter total fixed rate cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rate variable rate cash flows in thousands weighted average interest rate includes million of variable rate debt which has effectively been converted to fixed rate through an interest rate swap agreement 
there are no other significant market risk exposures
