item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company now operates via two principal segments  biospherics and health sciences 
biospherics seeks to develop one proprietary product for commercial application 
health sciences provides technical and regulatory consulting services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as providing technical support for the company s own r d activities 
the health sciences segment was created in july  when claire l 
kruger  ceo and coo  joined the company 
the company organized health sciences to better facilitate its biospherics efforts and to provide a modest amount of revenue during the biospherics development efforts 
biospherics is focused on only one potential product  naturlose as an effective treatment for type diabetes 
in april  the company commenced a phase clinical trial under a food and drug administration fda investigational new drug ind application process for this purpose 
as a result  the company has incurred substantial development costs and expects to continue to incur substantial development costs until completed  without any substantial corresponding revenue 
infospherix provided contact center information and reservations services for government and industry 
on august   the company sold infospherix to focus substantially all of its efforts on biospherics 
the operations of infospherix are reported in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations 
results of operations compared with revenue and direct costs revenue and direct contract costs are primarily related to the company s health sciences business  which started in july and has seen a steady growth in revenue each quarter 
the consulting business generally provides services on either a fixed price basis or on a time and expenses basis  charging hourly rates for each staff member involved in a project  based on his or her skills and experience 
engagement agreements typically provide for monthly billing and payment within thirty days of receipt  and permit clients to terminate engagements at any time 
no substantial revenue is expected from the biospherics segment until the company is successful in selling or licensing its technology 
research and development research and development expenditures relate solely to the biospherics segment and consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  and other expenses related to our efforts to commercialize naturlose 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
the company s ongoing phase and dose range trials in the use of naturlose for the treatment of type diabetes are the primary focus of the biospherics division 
the r d expenditures for included start up costs for the phase clinical trial  including approximately million for drug packaging  warehousing and shipping  and those of the same periods in consisted of costs related to both the phase clinical trial and a phase dose range trial 
patient recruitment for the us clinical trial was slower than the company originally expected 
to enhance enrollment and retention  the company successfully petitioned the fda to eliminate the need for pre mixed liquid solutions for the delivery of study medicine 
the solutions were replaced with powder sachets  which are more convenient for the trial participants  and therefore improved patient retention 
in addition  beginning october  the company started conducting a portion of the phase and dose range trials in india where patient retention is greater than in the us in july  the company signed an agreement with a contract research organization cro to oversee the work of two india cros hired to execute the trials in india 
these changes have been successful in enhancing recruitment and compliance in the trial 
the company expects that the dose range trial will likely be completed in and the phase trial will likely be completed in mid  based on the current enrollment and retention numbers 
the company currently expects to obtain interim analysis results from the phase trial during mid  which may allow the company some preliminary insight as to the efficacy of naturlose as a treatment for type diabetes 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including facilities related expenses 
the decrease between years is primarily the result of the relocation of the company s headquarters to a smaller facility in bethesda  maryland  effective april   which decreased the company s overhead costs 
interest interest revenue in and was primarily derived from interest earned on the proceeds of the sale of the infospherix subsidiary in august during  the funds available for investing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased from to million 
in addition  the average yield on investments also decreased during the course of income tax the income tax benefit expense is related to the sale of infospherix in the third quarter of and the related release of the million escrow balance in november discontinued operations on august   the company completed the sale of infospherix for million million at closing and million following a month escrow period  pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated june  the million sale proceeds were included in the gain on sale of the discontinued segment at the time of closing in august the million escrow balance was recorded as a gain on sale of the discontinued segment when it was realized in november the infospherix segment comprised the majority of the company s operations prior to the sale 
the sale was conducted to allow spherix to focus substantially all of its efforts on biospherics 
the results of operations of the discontinued infospherix segment  including the costs to sell the segment  are as follows revenue direct cost and operating expense selling  general and administrative expense interest revenue interest expense other income gain on sale of segment income from discontinued operations before taxes sales backlog the company s backlog as of december  and  from the health sciences business was approximately million and  respectively 
the company bills for its consulting services primarily on a time and material basis and these amounts represent estimated contract values 
further  the company s consulting contracts are generally terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by clients 
as a result  backlog at any particular time is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported 
estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
spherix s critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results  and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such policies are discussed below 
accounting for taxes and valuation allowances we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carry forwards 
these deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the company s losses and its accumulated deficit  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable

sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources working capital as of december   was million  which represents a million decrease from working capital at december  a million loss from operations before taxes was partly offset by the million that was realized in november upon the receipt of the escrow balance from the sale of infospherix 
expenditures for the year included approximately million for r d activity and related market research costs 
cash flow for the year ended december   consisted of million used in operating activities including approximately million in r d activity and related market research and  provided by investing activities consisting primarily of million used to purchase short term investments and million provided from the release of the escrow balance and the interest revenue related to the sale of the infospherix subsidiary 
on june   as part of the sale of infospherix  the company closed its bank line of credit 
accordingly  we are operating our biospherics and health sciences efforts solely from the net proceeds we received from the sale of infospherix 
the newly launched health sciences business is not expected to generate any substantial excess cash flow in the next twelve months 
spherix expects to expend approximately million over the next year including million in costs related to the phase and dose range trials and other r d and marketing activity related to the commercialization of naturlose 
the phase clinical trial is expected to be completed in mid and the dose range trial in the company intends to finance the biospherics activities principally through proceeds received from the sale of infospherix and is considering raising additional funds through the sale of common stock and or other means 
while the company completes its phase trial  it is taking other steps to prepare for commercialization of naturlose as a treatment for type diabetes on the assumption that the trials will be successful 
these steps include the dose range trial  exploring manufacturing alternatives and seeking marketing assistance 
the company s goal is to attract a pharmaceutical company to purchase or license the technology at the earliest practicable stage 
our preliminary marketing analysis suggests that we may increase our chances of success by engaging in some directed marketing efforts as we proceed with the phase trial 
continued progress on the clinical trial of naturlose as a treatment of type diabetes and on the other initiatives described above is dependent upon many factors including  but not limited to  the company having sufficient funds and resources 
to date  the company has not had  and does not expect to have  any meaningful offers until the efficacy of naturlose has been further established 
the company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to complete the phase trial provided the trial is completed as expected by mid  but does not believe its resources will be sufficient to then prepare  submit and pursue the fda new drug application nda or take other steps necessary to bring naturlose to market as a type diabetes drug 
additional funds may be required if the phase trial is further delayed 
the total cost of completing the phase trial is difficult to determine and can be affected by any number of factors including  but not limited to  the time to complete the trial 
no guarantee can be given that the company will be successful in its efforts to raise additional funds and  as many of our costs are fixed  any additional delays in the phase trial could cause us to expend all of our funds before the trial is complete
