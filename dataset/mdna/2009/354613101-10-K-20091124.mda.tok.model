cash management consists of us registered money market funds and non us registered funds non us funds with similar investment objectives 
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management 
as noted in the risk factors section set forth above in item a of this annual report on form k  the amount and mix of our assets under management are subject to significant fluctuations and can negatively impact our revenues and income 
to a lesser degree  the level of our revenues also depends on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts

these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business is banking finance

during the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year  the global financial crisis that began in continued and the economy remained in a recession 
the turmoil in the global financial markets during the first half of the fiscal year  evidenced by decreases in both the msci world and s p indexes  negatively impacted the entire asset management industry 
the unprecedented downturn in the markets significantly affected our assets under management  fee revenues and non operating income  all of which decreased sharply during the fiscal year 
governments and central banks around the world focused on increasing liquidity in the capital markets and easing the financial crisis 
credit conditions began to improve during the second half of the fiscal year  as credit availability increased and credit spreads tightened 
improvement in market conditions was also indicated by increases of and in the msci world and s p indexes during the second half 
our results of operations improved during our third and fourth fiscal quarters consistent with the positive market performance 
our total assets under management at september  were billion  higher than they were at september  however  simple monthly average assets under management for the twelve months ended september  decreased from the prior fiscal year due to significantly lower levels of assets under management during the first half of the fiscal year 
total assets under management were negatively impacted by market depreciation of billion during the first half of the fiscal year and then benefited from market appreciation of billion during the second half 
net new flows were a negative billion during the first half of the fiscal year as investor demand shifted to lower risk 
table of contents investments  and swung to a positive billion in the second half as long term sales increased  most notably in our fixed income funds 
overall  we had negative net new flows of billion for the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we took steps to manage our business and our cost structure to respond to the market conditions and resulting decrease in revenue  including reducing expenditures in areas such as travel and entertainment  advertising  and contractor and professional fees  and deferring non business critical initiatives and hiring 
we also announced reductions to our global workforce of approximately 
the severance costs related to these workforce reductions amounted to million for the fiscal year 
we continue to assess cost reduction measures as we adapt to the unprecedented changes affecting our industry 
despite the ongoing financial crisis  the relative performance of our sponsored investment products remained strong  with to of our us registered long term mutual funds in the top half of the lipper performance rankings as both equity and fixed income funds showed significant improvement in fiscal year challenging and volatile market conditions might continue to be present in the foreseeable future 
as we confront the challenges of this economic environment  we expect to continue to focus on the investment performance of our sponsored investment products and on providing high quality customer service to our clients 
while we are focused on reducing costs  we will also seek to attract  retain and develop employees and invest strategically in systems and technology that will provide secure  stable environments and economies of scale 
we will also seek to continue to protect and further our brand recognition while developing and maintaining broker dealer and client relationships 
the success of these and other strategies may be influenced by the factors discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report  and other factors as discussed herein

operating income net income earnings per share basic diluted operating margin defined as operating income divided by total operating revenues 
net income decreased in fiscal year primarily due to an million decline in operating income 
adverse market conditions led to a decrease in our simple monthly average assets under management  which resulted in a decrease in our operating revenues 
as described above  we have taken actions to reduce our operating expenses in response to the market conditions and resulting revenue decreases  which contributed to a decrease in operating expenses for the fiscal year 
operating income increased in the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year  consistent with a decrease in operating revenues and a decrease in operating expenses 
operating revenues remained stable despite the sustained volatility experienced in the financial markets as we began the year with a high level of assets under management 
we also benefited from the diversification of our products and customer base and successful marketing campaigns 
during fiscal year we initiated steps to manage our business and our cost structure in response to the deteriorating market conditions 

table of contents net income decreased in fiscal year primarily due to a decline in other income  net 
the decrease in other income  net reflects a decrease in investment and other income  net primarily due to lower realized gains on sale of investment securities  a decline in income from our investments in equity method investees  and lower interest and dividend income 
also contributing to the decrease in other income  net were net losses recognized by our consolidated sponsored investment products in fiscal year  as compared to net gains in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in other income  net was partially offset by a increase in investment management fees 
diluted earnings per share decreased in fiscal years and  consistent with the decreases in net income  partially offset by and decreases in diluted average common shares outstanding primarily resulting from the repurchase of shares of our common stock

investment management fees from approximately of our assets under management at september  were calculated using daily average assets under management 
our assets under management at september  were higher than they were at september  primarily due to market appreciation of billion during fiscal year  as compared to market depreciation of billion during fiscal year the appreciation during fiscal year related primarily to fixed income products  while the depreciation in fiscal year occurred predominantly in equity products as market volatility led to significant valuation decreases and a shift in investor demand to lower risk investments 
the depreciation and net outflows persisted throughout the first half of fiscal year before the market recovery began in the second half  resulting in a decrease in simple monthly average assets under management during the year 
the simple monthly average is generally more indicative of trends in revenue for providing investment management and fund administration services than the year over year change in ending assets under management

our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year and for fiscal year the decreases in each of the past two years were primarily due to shifts in the mix of assets under management from equity products towards fixed income products during both years 
the shifts mainly resulted from depreciation and net new outflows of equity products  partially offset by net new inflows of fixed income products

investment management fees increased in fiscal year resulting from a increase in simple monthly average assets under management  partially offset by a lower effective investment management fee rate resulting from a higher mix of fixed income assets 
underwriting and distribution fees we earn underwriting fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor 
therefore  underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales  the size of individual transactions  and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors 
globally  our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
specifically  the majority of us registered mutual funds  with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds  have adopted distribution plans the plans under rule b promulgated under the investment company act 
the plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares  such as expenses for marketing  advertising  printing and sales promotion  subject to the plans limitations on amounts 
the individual plans set a percentage limit for rule b expenses based on average daily net assets under management of the mutual fund 
similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non us funds and where  generally  the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions 
we pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
overall  underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal year underwriting fees decreased primarily due to a shift in sales from equity products to fixed income products  which typically generate lower underwriting fees  combined with a decrease in gross commissionable sales 
distribution fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in simple monthly average assets under management and a higher mix of fixed income assets 
distribution fees are generally higher for equity products  as compared to fixed income products 
total underwriting and distribution fees decreased in fiscal year underwriting fees decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross sales of class a shares  mainly in the united states  and a shift in sales of equity products to fixed income products 
distribution fees increased primarily due to a increase in simple monthly average assets under management  partially offset by a higher mix of assets fixed income assets 
shareholder servicing fees we receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service  and tax reporting 
these fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some instances  we charge sponsored investment products these fees based on the level of assets under management 
in the united states  transfer agency service agreements provide that 
table of contents accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
approximately million accounts closed in the us during calendar year were no longer billable effective july   as compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective july  approximately million accounts closed in canada during calendar year were no longer billable effective may   as compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective may  shareholder servicing fees decreased in fiscal year primarily due to an unfavorable currency impact and a decrease in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts during the year 
the unfavorable currency impact mainly resulted from a decrease in value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
the account decrease was predominantly related to shareholder accounts originated in canada and the united states 
shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal year primarily due to a increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts  partially offset by an increase in shareholder accounts originated in asia 
consolidated sponsored investment products income  net consolidated sponsored investment products income  net reflects the net investment income  including dividend and interest income  of sponsored investment products that we consolidate in our financial statements 
consolidated sponsored investment products income  net decreased in fiscal year and increased in fiscal year  reflecting the investment performance and the net asset balances of the specific sponsored investment products that we consolidated during each period 
other  net other  net revenue primarily consists of revenues from the banking finance segment as well as income from custody services 
banking finance revenues include interest income on loans  servicing income  and realized and unrealized gains losses on residual interests from securitization transactions  and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
other  net revenue decreased in fiscal year primarily due to a million higher loss from declines in the fair value of residual interests from securitization transactions and a million decrease in interest income from automobile loans  partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense on swap contracts and a million decrease in provision for loan losses 
we have consistently followed our methodology in determining our allowance for loan losses  which incorporates current economic factors 
other  net revenue decreased in fiscal year primarily due to a million increase in net realized and unrealized losses on investments and a million increase in provision for loan losses  partially offset by a million increase in interest income from automobile loans

the decreases in underwriting and distribution expenses in fiscal years and were consistent with the and decreases in underwriting and distribution revenues during both periods 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefit expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to declines in salaries  wages and benefits and variable compensation 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased million  mainly resulting from lower staffing levels and a favorable currency impact 
the decrease was partially offset by severance costs of million related to reductions to our global workforce of approximately announced during the first half of fiscal year variable compensation decreased million 
the decreased expenses during fiscal year reflect in part some of the actions we have taken to contain costs  including reducing variable compensation and not providing annual merit salary increases 
as of september   we had approximately  employees  a decrease from approximately  at september  compensation and benefit expenses increased in fiscal year primarily due to annual merit salary adjustments that were effective december  and higher staffing levels 
another contributing factor was an increase in variable compensation  primarily resulting from the impact of adopting a new accounting pronouncement in october requiring us to recognize an additional compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by a one time pre tax charge of million recorded in fiscal year and a decrease in costs related to matching contributions under our amended and restated employee stock investment plan 
we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy 
as such  any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefits going forward 
however  in order to attract and retain talented individuals  our level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue 

table of contents information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs decreased in fiscal year primarily due to lower costs incurred for external data services  technology consulting  technology supplies  and occupancy 
the lower costs resulted in part from our cost reduction efforts to defer non business critical initiatives and to reduce expenditures for contractors and professional fees 
information systems  technology and occupancy costs increased slightly in fiscal year primarily due to higher occupancy costs related to our existing offices as well as global expansion 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in external data services costs and technology consulting costs 
details of capitalized information systems and technology costs  which exclude occupancy costs  are shown below 
in millions for the fiscal years ended september  net carrying value at beginning of period additions during period  net of disposals amortization during period net carrying value at end of period advertising and promotion advertising and promotion expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to a million decrease in marketing support payments to intermediaries resulting from lower product sales and assets under management 
also contributing to the decrease were lower advertising  sales promotions and travel expenses primarily as a result of our global cost reduction initiatives 
advertising and promotion expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to a million decrease in printing costs 
also contributing to the decrease were lower global media advertising and promotion expenses 
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions  and to advance our products where we see continued or potential new growth opportunities 
as a result of potential changes in our strategic marketing campaigns  the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly  or decrease more slowly  than our revenues 
amortization of deferred sales commissions certain fund share classes sold globally  including class c and class r shares marketed in the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales 
in addition  certain share classes  such as class a shares sold in the united states  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met  although our distribution subsidiaries pay an up front commission to financial intermediaries on these sales 
we defer all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries and amortize them over the periods in which commissions are generally recovered from distribution and service fee revenues and contingent sales charges received from shareholders of the funds upon redemption of their shares 
we evaluate deferred commission assets dca for recoverability on a periodic basis using undiscounted expected cash flows from the shares of mutual funds sold without a front end sales charge 

table of contents amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased in fiscal year mainly due to lower product sales with up front commissions  primarily related to us funds 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal year mainly due to higher product sales with up front commissions  primarily related to us and canadian funds 
other operating expenses other operating expenses primarily consist of professional fees  fund administration services and shareholder servicing fees payable to external parties  corporate travel and entertainment  and other miscellaneous expenses

other income expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to lower investment valuations during the first half of the year 
the significant decline in interest rates and the global market downturn resulted in a million decrease in interest income  a million increase in other than temporary impairments on available for sale investment securities  a million decline in net realized gains on sale of available for sale investment securities  and a million decline in income from equity method investees 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in net gains from securities held by our consolidated sponsored investment products  resulting from improved market conditions during the second half of the fiscal year 
other income expenses decreased in fiscal year primarily due to million in net losses recognized by our consolidated sponsored investment products  driven mainly by market value declines in equity products  as compared to net gains in the prior fiscal year 
net realized gains on sale of investment securities  available for sale declined million  income from equity method investees declined million  interest income declined million and dividend income declined million primarily due to unfavorable market conditions 

table of contents our investments in sponsored investment products primarily consist of the initial cash investments made in the course of launching mutual fund and other investment product offerings  however we may also invest in our products for other business reasons 
the market conditions that impact our assets under management similarly affect the investment income earned or losses incurred on our sponsored investment product investments 
taxes on income as a multi national corporation  we provide investment management and related services to a wide range of international sponsored investment products  often managed from locations outside the united states 
some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the united states 
the mix of pre tax income primarily from our investment management and related services business subject to these lower rates  when aggregated with income originating in the united states  produces a lower overall effective income tax rate than existing us federal and state income tax rates 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  as compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to a shift in the mix of pre tax income from lower tax jurisdictions to higher tax jurisdictions 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to an income tax charge related to repatriated earnings of our non us subsidiaries and our mix of foreign earnings 
the effective income tax rate for future reporting periods will continue to reflect the relative contributions of non us earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income 
during september  we amended our repatriation plan for undistributed foreign earnings to include repatriation to the us of the excess net earnings after debt service payments and regulatory capital requirements of our uk consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result of the amendment  we recognized a provision for us income taxes of million and a net deferred income tax liability of million in relation to million of accumulated and current earnings from the united kingdom  of which million was repatriated as of september  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity  capital resources and uses of capital in millions as of and for the fiscal years ended september  balance sheet data assets liquid assets cash and cash equivalents liabilities debt commercial paper medium term notes variable funding notes federal home loan bank advances long term debt total debt cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows

cash and cash equivalents at september  increased primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities 
at september   the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by our us and us operations were approximately and  as compared to approximately and at september  the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by our non us operations increased primarily due to liquidation of investments  mainly time deposits with original maturities greater than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of purchase  partially offset by dividends paid to our us operations 
the decrease in total debt outstanding during fiscal year primarily relates to amortization and reduction of long term debt  a reduction in federal home loan bank fhlb advances  and repayment of variable funding notes  partially offset by an increase in commercial paper outstanding 
we experienced a decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year  primarily due to decreases in net income and proceeds from the securitization of loans held for sale  partially offset by a lower increase in trading securities 
net cash provided by investing activities increased mainly due to an increase in liquidation of investments and a decrease in loans receivable 
net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to a decrease in common stock repurchases and a decrease in payments on debt  partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt and a decrease in minority interest cash receipts in our consolidated sponsored investment products 
capital resources during fiscal year  we experienced a significant reduction in operating revenues primarily resulting from lower assets under management due to decreased market valuations and customer redemptions 
despite this reduction and decrease in liquidity and credit availability in the market  we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under current credit facilities and the ability to issue debt or equity securities 
at september   our current debt consisted of commercial paper with a total face value of million that was issued at a weighted average annualized interest rate of and matures during the quarter ending december  the banking finance segment has financed its automobile lending business primarily through fhlb advances  securitizations and the issuance of variable funding notes under one year revolving variable funding note warehouse credit facilities

the revolving credit facility is subject to various financial covenants  including  but not limited to  minimum requirements related to our interest coverage ratio and maintenance of working capital as well as limitations on our capitalization ratio  indebtedness  investments and liens 
interest rates on loans under the revolving credit facility are determined at the time of issuance and depend on the type of loan issued 
as of september   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with the financial covenants related to this facility 
in addition  at september   the banking finance segment had million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the federal reserve system  million available in secured federal reserve bank short term discount window and million available in secured fhlb short term borrowing capacity

using the shelf registration statement  we may sell  at any time and from time to time  in one or more offerings  our shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock  debt securities  convertible securities  warrants or units 
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner  our business could be adversely impacted 
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to expand our core business  make strategic acquisitions  acquire shares of our common stock  fund property and equipment purchases  pay operating expenses of the business  enhance technology infrastructure and business processes  pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt 
on september   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share payable on october  to stockholders of record on october  we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value 
our stock repurchase program is affected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
the common stock repurchases made as of september  reduced our capital in excess of par value to nil and the excess amount was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings 
at september   approximately million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program 
our stock repurchase program is not subject to an expiration date 
the funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions  including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in kind redemptions  and lines of credit 
while we have no contractual obligation to do so  we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives

capital contribution commitments relate to our agreements to fund certain of our sponsored investment products 
the table excludes future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits 
as of september   our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  and approximately million of accrued interest see note taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
however  because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of september   cannot be made 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are million and million 
contingent obligations we are obligated to cover shortfalls for automobile loan securitization trusts that are structured as qualified special entities in amounts due to holders of asset backed securities up to certain levels 
at september   the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees was million and the fair value of the guarantees recognized as banking finance liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was not significant 
during fiscal year  we increased the amount of cash on deposit by million to replace the letters of credit for the securitization trusts 
as a result  the maximum potential amounts of future payments related to the guarantees were reduced by the same amount 
at september   the banking finance segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers  primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers

we repurchased the remaining dca from lafl in september and have reflected this transaction as a repayment of the remaining financing obligation 
we are in the process of selling our ownership interests in lfl and lafl to the holder of the ownership interest and expect to complete this divestiture in fiscal year our banking finance segment periodically enters into automobile loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors see note securitization of loans held for sale in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
our main objective in entering into these securitization transactions is to obtain financing for automobile loan activities 
securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled million and million at september  and in our role as agent or trustee  we facilitate the settlement of investor share purchase  redemption  and other transactions with affiliated mutual funds 
we are appointed by the affiliated mutual funds as agent or trustee to manage  on behalf of the affiliated mutual funds  bank deposit accounts that contain only i cash remitted by investors to the affiliated mutual funds for the direct purchase of fund shares  or ii cash remitted by the affiliated mutual funds for direct delivery to the investors for either the proceeds of fund shares liquidated at the investors direction  or dividends and capital gains earned on fund shares 
as of september  and  we held cash of approximately million and million off balance sheet in agency or trust for investors and the affiliated mutual funds 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
for additional information about our accounting policies  please refer to note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
fair value measurements we record substantially all of our investments in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit 
table of contents price 
we use a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below 
our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level quoted prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data 
level quoted prices are obtained from independent third party brokers or dealers  including prices derived from model based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
these inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level valuations are derived primarily from model based valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the market 
trading securities  securities available for sale  and derivatives are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
we may also measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these fair value measurements generally result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting for loans held for sale or write downs of individual assets 
at september   level assets represented approximately of total assets measured at fair value  and level liabilities measured at fair value were insignificant 
there were immaterial transfers into and out of level during fiscal year the following is a description of the significant assets measured at fair value  the fair value methodologies used  and the fair value hierarchy level 
investment securities  trading consist primarily of securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products  non consolidated sponsored investment products held for trading purposes  and retained subordinated securities and residual interests from securitization transactions 
changes in the fair value of these securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings 
the fair value of securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products is primarily determined using quoted market prices  or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes 
these securities are primarily classified as level or level consolidated sponsored investment products may also hold securities that are classified as level because their fair value is determined using unobservable inputs 
the fair value of these securities is determined using valuation methods as appropriate for each security type such as model based valuations or prices of similar securities adjusted for illiquidity and credit risk factors 
the fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products held for trading purposes is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products  and they are classified as level 
table of contents the fair value of retained subordinated securities from securitization transactions is determined using independent third party broker or dealer price quotes  and these securities are classified as level the broker or dealer price quotes are evaluated for reasonableness based upon the performance of the underlying loans and comparable transaction pricing in the securitization market 
the fair value of residual interests currently is determined using unobservable inputs and classified as level the residual interests consist of interest only strips receivable and cash on deposit  and are backed by prime  non prime and sub prime automobile loans issued from march to april the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses 
key inputs to the analysis include the excess cash flow discount rate  the cumulative life loss rate  expected weighted average life and prepayment speed assumption 
we develop our key inputs using our actual portfolio experience and recent market activity for similar transactions 
at least one of the significant inputs used in the fair valuation is not observable because recent economic events have significantly reduced the number of comparable securitization transactions 
during fiscal year  we recognized million of write downs to the residual interests primarily due to an increase in the cumulative life loss rate  partially offset by a decrease in the excess cash flow discount rate 
we increased the cumulative life loss rate assumption from a range of to at september  to a range of to at september  to reflect increases in experienced and expected losses 
this resulted in an increase in the weighted average assumption for the cumulative life loss rate from at september  to at september  the excess cash flow discount rate decreased from at september  to at september  as a result of the changing liquidity premium in the securitization market 
the key assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of the residual interests to an immediate adverse change in those assumptions are shown in note securitization of loans held for sale in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
investment securities  available for sale consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products and debt securities including us government sponsored enterprise obligations  securities of us states and political subdivisions  securities of the us treasury and federal agencies  and corporate debt securities 
realized gains and losses are included in investment income using either the average cost method or specific identification method 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized 
the fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products  and they are classified as level the fair value of the debt securities is determined using quoted market prices or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes  which are evaluated for reasonableness  and they are generally classified as level  except for certain us treasury securities which are classified as level loans held for sale consist of retail installment loan sale contracts held for sale in securitization transactions 
the contracts are secured by new and used automobiles purchased from motor vehicle dealers 
the fair value of loans held for sale generally is estimated based on the whole loan market price that would be received if the loans were sold in their current condition  which may include adjustments based on the composition of the loan portfolio and liquidity factors 
as a result of recent economic conditions  observable whole loan prices for comparable portfolios of automobile loans sold have not been readily available 
therefore  the fair value currently is determined by using discounted cash flow analyses with estimated discount rates for loans with similar terms and collateral 
accordingly  loans held for sale currently are classified as level while we believe the valuation methodologies described above are appropriate  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value 
for available for sale equity securities  we consider many factors  including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost  our intent and ability to hold 
table of contents the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value  and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer 
when an impairment of an available for sale equity security is determined to be other than temporary  we recognize the impairment in earnings 
for available for sale debt securities  if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost  we record the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of its amortized cost  we separate the impairment into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
the credit loss component is the difference between the security s amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and the losses related to all other factors are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary impairment in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
intangible assets consist primarily of mutual fund management contracts and customer base assets resulting from business acquisitions 
we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which range from seven to years  using the straight line method  unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily represent contracts to manage mutual fund assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period 
we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
historically  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october of each fiscal year 
during fiscal year  we changed our annual impairment test date from october to august of each year 
we believe the august date better aligns our annual goodwill impairment test with the budget data developed in connection with the budgeting process that takes place in july and august 
in addition  the annual impairment test will be completed during our fourth fiscal quarter using the most recent financial information such that the results will better reflect the fiscal year being reported 
this change to the date of our annual goodwill impairment test constitutes a change in the method of applying an accounting principle 
we believe that this change in accounting principle is preferable and we filed a letter of preferability from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding this change in accounting principle as an exhibit to our form q for the quarter ended march  our goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step requires the identification of the reporting units  and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we have two reporting units  investment management and related services and banking finance  which are the same as our operating segments 
all goodwill has been assigned to the investment management and related services reporting unit 

table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired 
impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible assets  we use valuation techniques based on an income approach where future cash flows are discounted 
our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about revenue and assets under management growth rates  pre tax profit margin  the average effective fee rate  the effective tax rate  and the discount rate  which is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the assets under management growth rate and the discount rate 
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of august  we estimated the discounted future cash flows using a compounded annual growth rate of assets under management and a discount rate of 
the fair value of the investment management and related services reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 
the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 
the assumptions used in our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were developed taking into account the ongoing market conditions with an expectation that the recovery in the level of assets under management may take longer than has been historically experienced in years following a severe market downturn 
therefore  the growth rate assumption used as of august  was lower than the historical compounded growth rates 
we did not recognize any impairment because our estimates of the fair values of our reporting unit and our indefinite lived assets exceeded their respective carrying values 
a hypothetical basis point decline in the assets under management growth rate or a basis point increase in the discount rate would not cause either the investment management and related services reporting unit or the management contracts to fail step one of the impairment tests for goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
we subsequently monitor the market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value  or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
we consider  among other things  changes in our assets under management and pre tax profit margin amounts  which affect our revenue growth rate assumptions  by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment test as of august  we also monitor fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole 
subsequent to august   there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as we determined no events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value  or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
we test definite lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly 
impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from these assets 
our future undiscounted cash flow projections include assumptions about revenue and assets under management growth rates  effective fee rates  investor redemptions  pre tax profit margin  and expected useful lives 
the most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the change in the amount of assets under management 
the assumptions used in our impairment tests are developed taking into consideration the ongoing market conditions 
if the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows  we measure the impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value of the asset is determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type 

table of contents as of september   approximately of our definite lived intangible assets related to investment management contracts of fiduciary trust company international ftci high net worth accounts 
we estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for the contracts using assets under management growth rates ranging from to and the future discounted cash flows using a discount rate of 
we did not recognize an impairment loss because the fair value of the contracts exceeded their carrying value 
as of september   a decline in our assets under management of approximately could cause our ftci high net worth management contracts to be impaired 
the undiscounted future cash flow projections for the remaining of our definite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 
we estimated the undiscounted future cash flows using assets under management growth rates ranging from to  depending on the type of management contracts 
as of september   a decline in our assets under management of approximately could cause us to evaluate whether the fair value of our other definite lived intangible assets is below the asset carrying value 
while we believe that our impairment tests and the assumptions used to estimate fair value are reasonable and appropriate  if the assumptions used in our estimates of fair value change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise accelerate amortization expense 
revenues we recognize investment management fees  shareholder servicing fees and distribution fees as earned over the period in which services are rendered  except for performance based investment management fees  which are recognized when earned 
we recognize underwriting commissions related to the sale of shares of our sponsored investment products on the trade date 
investment management fees are generally determined based on a percentage of assets under management  except for performance based investment management fees  which are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts 
generally  shareholder servicing fees are calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced  while distribution fees are generally based on a percentage of assets under management 
assets under management is calculated for our sponsored investment products using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices  unadjusted independent third party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets  or adjusted market prices or price quotes 
the fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies as appropriate for each security type 
securities for which market prices are not readily available generally represent a de minimus amount of our total assets under management 
the pricing of the securities held by our sponsored investment products is governed by a global valuation and pricing policy  which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type  including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events 
while recent economic conditions and financial market declines have increased market price volatility  the fair value of the majority of the securities held by the sponsored investment products continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  we determine whether it is more likely than not that 
table of contents the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses 
as a multinational corporation  we operate in various locations outside the united states and generate earnings from our non us subsidiaries 
we indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries  except for subpart f income taxed in the us  subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or contractual repatriation requirements  and the excess net earnings after debt service payments and regulatory capital requirements of our canadian and uk consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result  we have not recognized a provision for us income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on billion of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at september  changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non us earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount 
see also note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
consolidation of variable interest entities we consolidate any variable interest entity vie for which we are considered the primary beneficiary 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment 
the entity that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary  is required to consolidate the vie 
we invest in various entities in the normal course of business and evaluate whether each entity is a vie 
for the entities determined to be vies  we assess whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of the vies 
our vies primarily include certain sponsored investment products and certain other investment products in which we hold an equity ownership interest 
other vies include limited liability partnerships  limited liability companies  and joint ventures 
the form of variable interests that we have in vies generally includes our equity ownership interest and investment management and related service fees earned from sponsored investment products 
our evaluation of whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of vies is highly complex and involves significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
we generally utilize expected cash flow scenarios to determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of vies from our investment management and related service fees or equity ownership interests held 
the key estimates and assumptions used in our analyses include the amount of assets under management  investment management and related service fee rates  the life of the investment product  and the discount rate 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability 
for example  assets under management are impacted by market volatility and the level of sales  redemptions  contributions  withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily 
also  investment management fees may be fixed or tiered based on the amount of assets under management  the life of a 
table of contents sponsored investment product may be finite or indefinite  and the discount rate could be affected by credit  liquidity or other risks factors 
in addition  third party purchases and redemptions  which are outside of our control  need to be evaluated to determine whether they cause a reconsideration event 
based on our evaluation  we believe we were not the primary beneficiary of vies and  as a result  did not consolidate these entities as of and for fiscal year while we believe that our evaluation was appropriate  future changes in estimates  judgments  and assumptions may affect whether certain related entities require consolidation in our financial statements

our enterprise risk management committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify  assess and manage market and other risks 
global markets have continued to experience unprecedented volatility  and challenging and volatile market conditions might continue to be present in the foreseeable future 
market conditions have resulted in a significant reduction in our assets under management  which directly impacts our revenues and net income 
a continued economic downturn and volatility in the global financial markets could also significantly affect the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used in the valuation of our financial instruments 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily through our loans  investment in debt securities  deposit liabilities and other outstanding debt 
we minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities  and through diversification 
we minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates 
in addition  our banking finance segment monitors the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources and  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure arising from the loans receivable portfolio 
at september   we have considered the potential impact of a movement in market interest rates on interest earning assets  net of interest bearing liabilities of our banking finance segment  total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities 
based on our analysis  we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in the next twelve months  for each of these categories or in the aggregate 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations 
while we operate primarily in the united states  we also provide services and earn revenues in the bahamas  asia pacific  canada  europe  latin america and africa 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is minimized in relation to our results of operations since a significant portion of these revenues are denominated in us dollars 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states and expenses incurred denominated in foreign currencies increase 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk in relation to our consolidated balance sheet mostly relates to cash and cash equivalents and investments that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily in euro  pound sterling  indian rupee  canadian dollar  korean won  and brazilian real 
these assets accounted for approximately of the total cash and cash equivalents and investments at september  we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange risk exposure 
as a result  both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income 
we are exposed to market valuation risks related to securities we hold that are carried at fair value and securities held by sponsored investment products that we consolidate  which are also carried at fair value
