item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for information regarding subscriber fees 
for the years ended december   and revenue derived from subscriber fees for the channels were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
advertising revenue television advertising is sold in a variety of formats 
most advertising supported cable networks rely largely upon the spot advertisement format 
spot advertisements are normally seconds long and air during or between programs 
they are often sold in packages of a certain number of spots with a commitment to deliver a certain number of viewers 
an alternative to spot advertising is sponsorship  
table of contents by which a company sponsors a program or selection of programs on a channel and receives enhanced exposure for its brand and products in these programs 
an additional form of television advertising is direct response advertising  which is designed to elicit a specific and quantifiable response from the viewer 
unlike spot advertising  fees payable for this form of advertising are measured by viewer response to advertising  such as product purchases  rather than the viewer ratings which measures success in programming 
a majority of the hallmark channel advertising revenue is comprised of spot advertising 
the hallmark movie channel s revenue has been comprised primarily of direct response revenue 
the ability of a television channel to generate advertising revenue largely depends on estimated or actual viewing levels  primarily based on ratings  and on advertising rates 
in the united states  independent ratings systems on which advertising sales can be based are well established and widely accepted within the industry 
in addition  pay television channel providers and distributors may also provide estimated or actual subscriber information 
our channel typically sells approximately of its advertising in the up front season  generally in june and july  for the last quarter of the same year and the first three quarters of the following year 
we hold back a small percentage of our inventory for audience deficiency units adus and sell the remainder in the spot or scatter market 
adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as fulfillment for advertising purchased in programs which did not deliver the ratings which the advertisers had been guaranteed 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for information on ratings based on viewing of commercial content as well as programming content 
as pay television channels draw audience share  audience demographics ie viewers categorized by characteristics such as age  sex and income become fragmented 
as a result  advertisers are able to target the specific groups of viewers who are most likely to purchase their products by buying advertising on channels which attract the desired viewer demographic 
we have advertising sales offices in new york  los angeles  chicago  and atlanta 
in addition  we have made significant investments in programming  research  marketing and promotions  all specifically designed to support the sale of advertising time on our channels 
for the years ended december   and revenue from the sale of advertising time on our channels were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in december  we entered into an agreement with google inc under which advertisers may place ads on the hallmark movie channel through the google platform  starting april and on the hallmark channel later in among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market in  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day viewership with an average household rating for the year and th for prime time with an average household rating for the year  according to nielsen media research 
in  among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market  the hallmark channel ranked th in total day viewership with an average household rating and th for prime time with an average household rating  according to nielsen media research 
total day means the time period measured from the time each day the broadcast of commercially sponsored programming commences to the time such commercially sponsored programming ends 
we believe that the key demographics for the hallmark channel are the viewers in the groups adults aged to and women aged to the average median age of a viewer of the hallmark channel was in and in licensing revenue until we sold our domestic library to rhi entertainment llc on december   we licensed our film assets to broadcasters and video distributors pay television channel providers who paid a license fee for the right to exhibit or distribute the programming over a certain period of time

further  the sites provide platforms for viewer participation in the channels sweepstakes promotions and community areas 
the sites have advertiser imaging including banner messages and video content 
channel operations the programming department has been responsible for ensuring the consistent quality of the programming we offer 
the programming  scheduling and acquisitions departments work in conjunction with the marketing and creative services departments to create the distinctive appearance of our channels 
some of these functions are outsourced on an as needed basis 
the creation of our channels begins with the acquisition of programming 
our staff or third parties review and summarize all potential programming to ensure compliance with our quality and content standards 
the creation of on air promotional segments interstitials  which are broadcast between the feature movies  miniseries and series  are typically created by the company s employees  but are occasionally outsourced to external vendors 
these interstitials are intended to invite viewership  guide 
table of contents viewers to specific programming  and promote brand awareness for the channels 
occasionally  these interstitials are sponsored by advertisers  resulting in additional advertising revenue 
the scheduling department creates the play list  which contains a list of daily programming 
the scheduling department works with advertising sales and research personnel to continuously monitor the effectiveness of programming content and sequence 
the play list is then forwarded to the traffic department 
the traffic department inserts promotional segments and advertising into the play list and creates the daily log  which contains a detailed schedule of the stream of programming  commercials and promotional materials that will ultimately be distributed to the subscribers of the channels 
channel delivery we deliver the daily log and digital tapes of the hallmark channel s programming  commercials and promotional messages to a third party network operations center in denver  colorado  where the programming  advertising and promotional elements are combined  compressed  and transported to an uplink facility in littleton  colorado 
the daily log and digital tapes of the hallmark movie channel s commercials and promotional messages are delivered to a third party network operations center in los angeles  california for hd and denver  colorado for sd  where the respective programming  advertising and promotional elements are similarly combined  compressed  and transported to an uplink facility in littleton  colorado

competition the pay television industry is highly competitive 
our channels compete for distribution  viewers and advertisers with other pay television channels  broadcast television channels and with other general forms of entertainment 
there are several sources of competition within our industry  each of which affects our business strategy 
the hallmark channel competes with other general entertainment programming from tnt  usa network  a e  the discovery channel  lifetime  oxygen  abc family and other similarly targeted channels 
we compete with these channels for viewers and advertising dollars based upon quality of programming  number of subscribers  ratings and subscriber demographics 
we compete with all channels for carriage on cable  satellite and telephone systems that may have limited capacity 
competition continues to intensify as the industry shifts from analog distribution to digital distribution 
many pay television distributors have upgraded their physical infrastructures to accommodate digital delivery  which provides significantly more channel capacity 
in an effort to accelerate the conversion  pay television distributors are attempting to place new channels on their digital tier as opposed to their limited  yet more widely distributed  analog tiers 
although competition for the remaining analog channel space is still intense  as more and more subscribers are converted  the digital tier is expected to become the dominant platform 
competitive strengths we believe that our primary competitive strengths include the following programming we have established a track record of providing high quality family programming 
pay television channels branded with the well known hallmark name our channels are branded with the hallmark name 
we believe that viewers and distributors associate the hallmark brand with family values and high quality content 
our association with this brand facilitates our efforts to achieve increased distribution and to attract additional viewers  which in turn leads to higher ratings and advertising revenue 
experienced management members of our senior management team have experience promoting and operating channels 
they have held senior positions at such companies as court tv  abc  cbs sports  fox family  discovery channel  amc and usa networks 
competitive risks one primary channel distributed domestically we operate only two channels 
many of our competitors have more than two channels and are also diversified entertainment companies  giving them an advantage in dealing with distributors and advertisers 
these companies are also able to leverage costs across multiple channels 
until the hallmark movie channel is more widely distributed  it will not provide significant leverage in negotiations with distributors and advertisers 

table of contents entertainment programming our programming is entertainment designed for adults and families and is intended to meet quality standards that are associated with the hallmark trademark 
our competitors may have more flexibility in programming 
ratings which affect advertising our ratings are a significant positive factor 
nevertheless  our competitors include channels with more subscribers and higher ratings  which affect rates that we can charge for advertising 
research the research department at the company provides strategic and tactical guidance to decision makers within the company  as well as supplying information about the channels to our potential advertisers and affiliates 
this department provides data on the size and demographics of our audience and information about our audiences  competitors  markets and industry 
currently  our channel s research department translates our overall business strategy into a cohesive research program 
this information assists our executives to more effectively target  brand  promote  program  and better understand where opportunities lie  in order to increase our channel s market share 
the research department has sophisticated research tools and competitive tracking database hardware and software 
trends and changes from these ratings systems are reported to top management for short and long term strategic planning 
our channel s performance is tracked through an internal tracking study established in july  which is a monthly telephone survey conducted among a national probability sample of approximately  adults 
the research department also subscribes to a number of other services  which are useful in obtaining information about viewers of our channel

if any of management s assumptions prove incorrect or should unanticipated circumstances arise  crown media holdings actual results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements could materially differ from those anticipated by such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are those discussed below in this form k 
crown media holdings will not update any forward looking statements contained in this form k to reflect future events or developments 
if we do not successfully address the risks described below  our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the trading price of our class a common stock could decline because of any of these risks 
risks relating to our business our business has incurred net losses since inception and may continue to incur losses 
our channels have a history of net losses and we expect to continue to report net losses for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  total stockholders deficit of approximately million  and goodwill of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve an operating profit or sustain a positive cash flow 
if we are not able to do so  the trading price of our class a common stock may fall significantly 
to diminish our losses  to continue to be profitable before interest expense and to continue to generate a positive cash flow  we will need to increase our advertising and subscriber revenue 
this will require  among other things  maintaining the distribution of our channels  attracting more and younger viewers to our channels  attracting more advertisers  and maintaining or increasing our subscriber and advertising rates 
risks associated with these areas of our business are described below 
in addition  in order to accomplish these goals  the management of crown media holdings continues to believe that it is necessary to maintain subscriber levels and enhance our programming  which may result in increased costs for programming 
over the last five years  these actions have contributed to net losses for crown media holdings 
to achieve positive net income  we would also need to decrease our interest expense by reducing our outstanding indebtedness 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health  and the restrictions imposed by the terms of our debt instruments may severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
to the extent interest is deferred and added to principal  the indebtedness increases 
as of december   our total debt was billion  and we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our bank credit facility to support our operations 
subject to restrictions under our debt agreements  we may also seek to restructure our debt or to engage in an equity or debt financing to cover any operating losses  to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as a result of our level of debt and the terms of our debt instruments our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions is heightened  
table of contents we will be required to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt  limiting the availability of cash for other purposes  we are  and will continue to be  limited by financial and other restrictive covenants in our ability to borrow additional funds  consummate asset sales  enter into transactions with affiliates or conduct mergers and acquisitions  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry will be limited  we are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired  and offers to purchase the company or its assets at prices that may be attractive to stockholders may be limited 
our ability to meet our debt and other obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performances and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our leverage and such restrictions will not materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities 
information concerning our liquidity may be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
we have significant interest expense  which may impact our future operations 
high levels of interest expense could have negative effects on our future operations 
interest expense  which includes amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense on borrowings under our senior and demand notes and bank credit facility  was significant over the past year 
although interest expense was lower in the past twelve months than in the previous twelve months  we continue to have significant outstanding indebtedness and related interest expense 
a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to pay our interest expense and will not be available for other business purposes 
in addition  we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet our obligations or to service our total debt 
our liquidity is dependent on external funds 
although in the past twelve months we generated positive cash flow from operations  unanticipated significant expense or any developments that hamper our growth in revenue or decreases any of our revenue  may result in the need for additional external funds in order to continue operations 
we have no arrangements for any such additional external financings  whether debt or equity  and are not certain whether any new external financing would be available on acceptable terms 
any new debt financing would require the cooperation and agreement of existing lenders 
further  as discussed in this report under liquidity and capital resources below  we need to extend  refinance or replace our credit facility on or prior to march   or to extend or replace borrowings from hallmark cards by march   that would result from hallmark cards purchasing the loans under that facility see note to our consolidated financial statements  and extend or refinance outstanding notes payables to hallmark cards and its subsidiaries on or prior to march   for three obligations and august in the case of the note  as described later in this report 

table of contents upon maturity of the credit facility on march   if not paid in full  jp morgan chase bank can elect to initiate a process to foreclose on the company s assets 
such foreclosure proceedings would affect our ability to continue our operations 
prior to any such possible foreclosure proceedings  however  the company would consider various alternatives 
the company could also cause hallmark cards  pursuant to the terms of the waiver and standby purchase agreement  to exercise its option to purchase the bank s interest in the credit facility and the bank credit facility would then be payable to hallmark cards upon demand after march  because of our possible inability to meet obligations when they become due on and after march   we anticipate that prior to march   it will be necessary to either extend or refinance the notes payable to affiliates of hallmark cards 
as part of the combination of actions and in order to obtain additional funding  the company may consider various alternatives including restructuring of the debt if possible  raising additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities or other strategic alternatives 
there is no assurance that hallmark cards and its affiliates will extend dates for the deferral of payments on indebtedness owed by us or participate in any extension  refinancing or restructuring of the indebtedness 
we have substantial outstanding obligations owed to hallmark cards and its affiliates 
these obligations include promissory notes and amounts owed under a service agreement 
hallmark cards  its affiliates and we are parties to a waiver and standby purchase agreement  as amended  under which principal payments and certain interest payments on the promissory notes are deferred until march   subject to earlier termination as provided in that agreement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources bank credit facility and hallmark notes and item certain relationships and related transactions and director independence 
these obligations and the waiver agreement have been negotiated by us with hallmark cards and its affiliates 
hallmark cards and its affiliates have no obligation and have not stated any intent  made any commitment or implied that any of them will extend until any later date the deferral of payments on the promissory notes or any service agreement amounts 
in addition  hallmark cards and its affiliates have no obligation and have not stated any intent  made any commitment or implied that hallmark cards or its affiliates would renew  refinance or participate in any restructuring of these obligations 
any decision by hallmark cards and its affiliates on these matters is at their discretion 
the bankruptcy of charter communications could affect our revenues adversely 
charter communications  which accounts for approximately of our subscribers  stated in early that it contemplated entering into a chapter bankruptcy proceeding by april  in order to implement a financial restructuring 
such a bankruptcy could result in a rejection in essence  a cancellation of our distribution agreement with charter communications  thereby potentially decreasing our subscriber revenue 
these effects depend on whether we would be able to renegotiate a new distribution agreement with charter communications or any purchaser of charter communications after the bankruptcy and whether there are any different terms in any renegotiated agreement 
if charter communications would be acquired by another distributor in the bankruptcy proceeding  the distribution agreement of the acquiring party may become applicable 
most favored nations provisions may require modification of existing distribution agreements which could adversely affect subscriber revenue 
a number of our existing distribution agreements contain most favored nations or mfn clauses 
these clauses typically provide that  in the event we enter into an agreement with another distributor on more favorable terms  these terms must be offered to the distributor holding the mfn right  subject to certain exceptions and conditions 
these clauses cover matters such as subscriber fees  
table of contents launch support  local advertising time and other financial and operating provisions 
in the past  after entering into new distribution agreements  we have been asked by some of the distributors holding mfn rights to modify their distribution agreements to incorporate financial terms similar to those in the new agreements 
any claims of this type in the future could result in lower overall subscriber revenue or increased cash outlays  however  if our subscription base is increased as a result of such modifications  it could result in higher advertising revenue 
if we are unable to obtain programming from third parties  we may be unable to increase our subscriber base 
we compete with other pay television channel providers to acquire programming 
if we fail to continue to obtain programming on reasonable terms for any reason  including as a result of competition  we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming  which may hinder the growth of our subscriber base 
if our programming declines in popularity  our subscriber fees and advertising revenue could fall 
our success depends partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
we may not be able to anticipate and react effectively to shifts in tastes and interests in our markets 
our competitors may have greater numbers of original productions  better distribution  and greater capital resources  and may be able to react more quickly to shifts in tastes and interests 
as a result  we may be unable to maintain the commercial success of any of our current programming  or to generate sufficient demand and market acceptance for our new programming 
a shift in viewer preferences in programming or alternative entertainment activities could also cause a decline in both advertising and subscriber fees revenue 
the decline in revenue could hinder or prevent us from achieving profitability or maintaining a positive cash flow and could adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
if we are unable to increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve improved results 
although it is expected over time that our advertising revenue will increase  if we fail to significantly increase our advertising revenue  we may be unable to achieve or sustain improved results or to expand our business 
a failure to increase advertising revenue may be a result of any or all of the following i the current economic environment presents uncertainty regarding the condition of the advertising marketplace and the financial health of many industry segments and individual companies  including those which advertise on our channels  ii we may be unable to reduce our average viewer age to be within our target audience of viewers between the ages of and  iii we may be unable to identify  attract and retain experienced sales and marketing personnel with relevant experience  iv our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against the significantly more extensive and well funded sales and marketing operations of our current or potential competitors  v the advancement of technologies such as digital video recording may cause advertisers to shift their expenditures to media in which their commercial messages are not circumvented by the technology  and or vi we will not be able to increase our advertising sales rate card or may be required to run additional advertising spots to fulfill guaranteed delivery numbers which affect the availability of advertising inventory for future sales 
success in increasing our advertising revenue also depends upon the number and coverage of the distributors who carry our channels  our number of subscribers  and the viewership ratings for our programming 
current economic conditions have resulted in softness of advertising rates and may materially adversely impact our business 
in the second half of  we experienced some softening of our general advertising rate prices and a more dramatic decrease in the rates of our direct response advertising because of economic 
table of contents conditions 
we expect the softness in advertising rates to continue during the volume of advertising has not been impacted 
see results of operations in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december   in this report for additional information on this subject 
in addition  the turmoil in the investment market  the tightening of credit and relatively high  increasing levels of unemployment in the united states have lead to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and possibly a reduction in business activity generally 
a continuation of these conditions could have the following negative effects  among others a reduction in spending by advertisers and consumers in general  which in turn could reduce our number of subscribers and or advertising rates  resulting in reduced revenue  an increase in bad debts or the reserve for bad debts  making more difficult or unlikely a refinancing or restructuring of our outstanding indebtedness  and exposure to any increased interest expense to the extent that any refinanced or restructured debt could be at a higher cost 
hallmark entertainment investments controls us and this control could create conflicts of interest or inhibit potential changes of control 
hallmark entertainment investments owns all of our outstanding shares of class b common stock and owns approximately of the outstanding shares of our class a common stock  representing in the aggregate approximately of the outstanding voting power on all matters submitted to our stockholders 
hallmark entertainment holdings  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  controls the voting of all our shares held by hallmark entertainment investments 
additionally  a significant portion of our overall indebtedness is held by hallmark cards or its wholly owned affiliates 
this control could discourage others from initiating potential merger  takeover or other change of control transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or holders of class a common stock 
as a result  the market price of our class a common stock could suffer  and our business could suffer 
in addition  the control that hallmark cards and or these specific wholly owned affiliates may exert over us  either directly or indirectly  could give rise to conflicts of interest in certain situations 
we could lose the right to use the name hallmark because we have limited duration license agreements  which could harm our business 
we license the name hallmark from hallmark licensing  inc  a subsidiary of hallmark cards  for use in the names of our channels 
this license will expire on september  if hallmark cards determines not to renew the trademark license agreements for any reason  including failure to comply with hallmark cards programming standards  we would be forced to significantly revise our business plan and operations  and could experience a significant erosion of our subscriber base and advertising revenue 
if our third party suppliers fail to provide us with network infrastructure services on a timely basis  our costs could increase and our growth could be hindered 
we currently rely on third parties to supply key network infrastructure services  including uplink  playback  transmission and satellite services to our market  which are available only from limited sources 
we have occasionally experienced delays and other problems in receiving communications equipment  services and facilities and may  in the future  be unable to obtain such services  equipment or facilities on the scale and within the time frames required by us on terms we find acceptable  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain  or if we experience a delay in the delivery of  such services  we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated expenses to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations  which could hinder our growth and reduce our revenue and potential profitability 

table of contents if we are unable to retain key executives and other personnel  our growth could be inhibited and our business harmed 
our success depends on the expertise and continued service of our executive officers and key employees of our subsidiaries 
if we fail to attract  hire or retain the necessary personnel  or if we lose the services of our key executives  we may be unable to implement our business plan or keep pace with developing trends in our industry 
the amount of our goodwill may hinder our ability to achieve profitability 
as a result of our acquisitions of all the common interests in crown media united states  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill 
we are required to periodically review whether the value of our goodwill has been impaired 
if we are required to write down our goodwill  our results of operations  stockholders equity deficit could be materially adversely affected 
our stock price may be volatile and could decline substantially 
the stock market has  from time to time  experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
many factors may cause the market price for our class a common stock to decline  including the following failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of investors in any quarter  economic conditions that adversely affect our advertising rates or our number of subscribers  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  technological innovations by competitors or competing technologies  perceptions by the investing community or our customers with respect to the prospects of our company or our industry  changes in general market conditions or economic trends  and failure by us to renew major distribution agreements 
additionally  of the approximately million shares of the company s outstanding class a common stock  only million shares approximately are held by non affiliates of the company 
this stock ownership structure may also be a cause of volatility in the market price of the company s class a common stock 
prior to entering into a new agreement on january   certain programming and other commitments in then existing agreements with the national interfaith cable coalition nicc would have terminated upon the sale of or more of the shares of class a common stock owned by nicc 
on january   we and nicc entered into a new agreement superseding prior agreements and terminating most programming relationships with nicc 
additionally  nicc owns approximately million shares of the company s class a common stock 
as a result of the agreement mentioned above  nicc has sold some of its class a common stock and may continue to do so  which could have an adverse impact on the share price of our class a common stock 

table of contents risks relating to our industry the recent change in the television rating system in the united states could reduce our channel revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
our domestic advertising revenue is partially dependent on television ratings provided by nielsen media research 
in  nielsen modified its ratings system by increasing its household sample size 
in the fourth quarter of  nielsen began measuring and providing performance data based on viewing of commercial content as well as programming content 
as the impact of the changes continue to take effect  our ratings could either be positively or negatively affected by these changes  depending on the demographic characteristics of the households added to the nielsen sample and the nature of the changes in the measurement systems 
from the beginning of the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of  we experienced a decrease in viewers of approximately under the new ratings measurement system compared to the system previously in use 
we have factored the new rating information into our advertising rates 
nielsen is continually in the process of modifying its ratings system to accommodate emerging technologies 
competition could reduce our channels revenue and our ability to achieve profitability 
we operate in the pay television business  which is highly competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with large diversified entertainment companies that have substantially greater resources than we have  our operating margins and market share could be reduced  and the growth of our business inhibited 
in particular  we compete for distribution with other pay television channels and  when distribution is obtained  for viewers and advertisers with pay television channels  broadcast television networks  radio  the internet and other media 
we also compete  to varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  electronic games and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
future technological developments may affect competition within this business 
a continuing trend towards business combinations and alliances in the communications industry may create significant new competitors for us or intensify existing competition 
many of these combined entities have more than one channel and resources far greater than ours 
these combined entities may provide bundled packages of programming  delivery and other services that compete directly with the products we offer 
we may need to reduce our prices or license additional programming to remain competitive  and we may be unable to sustain future pricing levels as competition increases 
our failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our programming at desired pricing levels could impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow  which would harm our business 
distributors in the united states may attempt to pressure pay tv channels having lower viewership  such as our channels  to accept decreasing amounts for subscriber fees  to pay higher subscriber acquisition fees or to allow carriage of the channels without the payment of subscriber fees 
factors that may lead to this pressure include the number of competing pay tv channels  the limited space available on services of distributors in the united states and the desire of distributors to maintain or reduce costs 
any reduction in subscriber fees revenue now or in the future could have a material impact on our operating results and cash flow 

table of contents new distribution technologies may fundamentally change the way we distribute our channels and could significantly decrease our revenue or require us to incur significant capital expenditures 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and to offer  on a timely basis  services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards 
the pay television industry has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to rapid and significant technological change  including continuing developments in technology which do not presently have widely accepted standards  and frequent introductions of new services and alternative technologies  including new technologies for providing video services 
for example  the advent of digital technology is likely to accelerate the convergence of broadcast  telecommunications  internet and other media and could result in material changes in the economics  regulations  intellectual property usage and technical platforms on which our business relies  including lower retail rates for video services 
these changes could fundamentally affect the scale  source  and volatility of our revenue streams  cost structures  and operating results  and may require us to significantly change our operations 
we also rely in part on third parties for the development of  and access to  communications and network technology 
as a result  we may be unable to obtain access to new technology on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms  which could harm our business and prospects 
moreover  the increased capacity of digital distribution platforms  including the introduction of digital terrestrial television  may reduce the competition for the right to carry channels and allow development of extra services at low incremental cost 
these lower incremental costs could lower barriers to entry for competing channels  and place pressure on our operating margins and market position 
changes in laws or regulations could adversely affect our distribution and thus our revenue 
the federal communications commission or congress may enact requirements that cable program services be offered to subscribers on an a la carte basis  ie be made available for purchase separately and not as part of a package of services or that the services be offered in specific packages such as a so called family tier 
such requirements could result in a reduction in the total number of subscribers to our program services and adversely affect advertising revenue

overview current business we own and operate the channels 
with million subscribers as provided by nielsen research in the united states at december   the hallmark channel is the th most widely distributed advertising supported cable channel in the united states 
for the fourth quarter of  the hallmark channel finished the quarter as the th highest rated advertising supported cable channel for total day ratings and the th highest rated advertising supported cable channel in prime time as measured by nielsen research 
we launched our second hour linear channel  the hallmark movie channel  during the first quarter of programming on the hallmark movie channel consists of movies and mini series 
the hallmark movie channel generated advertising revenue in and has generated subscriber fees and advertising revenue in as distribution continues to expand  the financial contribution of the hallmark movie channel may grow  including increases in advertising and subscription revenue 
the hallmark movie channel is operated through crown media holdings existing infrastructure at a small incremental cost 
in april  we began distributing the hallmark movie channel hd in high definition format  resulting in additional costs  however  we expect this additional format to contribute to subscriber growth for the hallmark movie channel 
for information regarding the sale of the domestic film library  through the sale of the company s membership interest in crown media distribution  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
current challenges and developments the company faces numerous operating challenges 
among them are maintaining and increasing advertising sales revenue  maintaining and expanding the distribution of the channels  broadening viewership demographics to meet our target audience  and increasing viewership ratings 
we have completed the upfront sales process during which we entered agreements with major advertising firms representing approximately of our advertising inventory for the last quarter of and first three quarters of this inventory was sold at cpms approximately higher than the inventory sold in the upfront 
the balance of the inventory will be sold in the scatter market 
continued weakness in the economy could result in lower demand and pricing for our inventory  and limit our ability to continue to grow advertising revenue at historical rates 
see results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue for additional information on advertising revenue 
distribution agreements are important because they affect our number of subscribers  which in turn has a major impact on our subscriber fees  the number of persons viewing our programming  and the rates charged for advertising 
the long term distribution challenges are renewing our distribution arrangements with the multiple system operators as they expire on favorable terms 
our major distribution agreements have terms which expire at various times from september   through  with options to renew  december in the first quarter of  we renewed distribution agreements with time warner cable and directv for multi year distribution of the hallmark channel 
in april  we renewed our 
table of contents distribution agreement with cablevision systems  which was the final major distribution agreement which originally expired in the renewal agreement covers the hallmark channel as well as the standard definition and high definition versions of the hallmark movie channel  resulting in an increase in distribution of the hallmark movie channel of more than million subscribers 
in september  we renewed our distribution agreement with charter communications inc under the agreement  charter continues to deliver the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel to approximately million subscribers 
domestic telephone companies have entered the business of distributing television channels to households through their wire lines 
we have agreements with several telephone companies and cooperatives of telephone companies  which permit the carriage of the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel and hallmark movie channel hd  and are negotiating with others 
the universe of cable tv subscribers in the united states is approximately million homes 
the top cable tv networks in the united states  measured by the number of subscribers  have million or more subscribers 
our goal is for the hallmark channel to reach million subscribers in the next one to two years 
three factors have contributed to the ratings of the hallmark channel acquired series and movies  original productions and marketing and promotional efforts 
certain acquired series have consistently delivered strong ratings across all day parts 
original productions are our most high profile programs and generate the hallmark channel s highest ratings 
their ratings success is of significant help to our distribution and advertising sales teams in selling the hallmark channel 
the company typically incurs additional marketing and promotional expenses surrounding original productions and certain acquired movies 
historically  nielsen cable television ratings were based on viewing of networks programming content 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  nielsen began measuring and providing performance data based on viewing of commercial content as well as programming content 
the new ratings information also includes data on viewing of program content through digital recording devices ie  dvr s  if that viewing occurs within three days of the program s air date 
from the beginning of the fourth quarter of through the second quarter of  we experienced a decrease in viewers of approximately under the new ratings measurement system as compared to the old ratings system 
we have factored the new rating information into our advertising rates  and at this time we do not expect a significant impact from the new rating information on our net advertising rates 
at december   the hallmark movie channel was distributed to over million subscribers  an increase of nearly million subscribers from september  this increase in distribution has and will continue to improve the company s ability to generate advertising revenue from the hallmark movie channel in sale of membership interests in crown media distribution please see note in our consolidated financial statements sale of membership interests in crown media distribution of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
impairment of assets please see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report for information on impairment charges for 
table of contents revenue from continuing operations our revenue consists primarily of subscriber fees and advertising fees  and until december  included film asset license fees 
subscriber fees subscriber fees are generally payable to us on a per subscriber basis by pay television distributors for the right to carry our channels 
in the past  for the most part  we have paid certain television distributors up front subscriber acquisition fees to carry our channel 
subscriber acquisition fees that we pay are capitalized and amortized over the contractual term of the applicable distribution agreement as a reduction in subscriber fee revenue 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
at the time we sign a distribution agreement  we evaluate the recoverability of the costs we incur against the incremental revenue directly and indirectly associated with each agreement 
rates we receive per subscriber vary with changes in the following factors  among others the degree of competition in the market  the relative position in the market of the distributor and the popularity of the channel  the packaging arrangements for the channel  and other commercial terms and length of the contract term 
we are in continuous negotiations with our existing distributors to increase our subscriber base in order to enhance our advertising revenue 
we have been subject in the past to requests by major distributors to pay subscriber acquisition fees for additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees our channels are usually offered as one of a number of channels on either a basic tier or part of other program packages and are not generally offered on a stand alone basis 
thus  while a cable or satellite customer may subscribe and unsubscribe to the tiers and program packages in which one of our channels is placed  these customers do not subscribe and unsubscribe to our channels alone 
we are not provided with information from the distributors on their overall subscriber churn and in what manner their churn rates affect our subscriber counts  instead  we are provided information on the total number of subscribers who receive the channels 
our subscriber count depends on the number of distributors carrying one of our channels and the size of such distributors as well as the program tiers on which our channel is carried by these distributors 
from time to time  we experience decreases in the number of subscribers as promotional periods end  or as a distributor arrangement is amended or terminated by us or the distributor 
the level of subscribers could also be affected by a distributor repositioning our channels from one tier to another tier 
management analyzes the estimated effect each new or amended distribution agreement will have on revenue and costs 
based upon these analyses  if subscriber acquisition fees are needed  management endeavors to achieve a fair combination of subscriber commitments and subscriber acquisition fees 
advertising our advertising rates are generally calculated on the basis of an agreed upon price per unit of audience measurement in return for a guaranteed commitment by the advertiser 
we commit to provide advertisers certain rating levels in connection with their advertising 
advertising rates also vary by time 
table of contents of year due to seasonal changes in television viewership 
revenue is recorded net of estimated delivery shortfalls  which are usually settled by providing the advertiser additional advertising time 
the remainder of the revenue is recognized as the make good advertising time is delivered 
film asset license fees crown media distribution generated revenue from the film assets by granting licenses to third parties to exhibit the films in the united states 
we also used the films as programming for the hallmark channel and the hallmark movie channel 
customers for our film assets consisted of other television channels  home video distributors and brokers who resold rights to our film assets 
license fees for our film assets were generally negotiated based upon  among other things  the size of the potential audience who were to be viewing the programming and the term of the license 
the market for our film library was typically seasonal  with over half of the annual sales occurring in the fourth quarter in past years 
this seasonality was generally due to the timing of our customers program scheduling activities 
in  film licensing activities and revenue were negatively affected by the sale process of the company s film library  which sale closed in december due to the sale of the company s film library  we no longer have film licensing activities 
cost of services our cost of services consists primarily of the amortization of program license fees  subscriber acquisition fee expense  the cost of signal distribution  administration  distribution and  until we sold our film assets  amortization of and other exploitation of our film assets  and the cost of promotional segments that are aired between programs 
we expect cost of services in to increase slightly or remain at the level 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires crown media holdings to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for further information regarding our critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates  please see the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following discussion concerns certain accounting estimates and assumptions that are considered to be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters and the susceptibility of such matters to changes 
program license fees program license fees are paid in connection with the acquisition of the rights to air programs acquired from others 
the cost of program rights are deferred and then amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their contractual license periods or anticipated usage 
on a yearly basis  the company evaluates the realizability of these deferred license fees in relation to the estimated future revenue 
estimates of net realizable value for program license fees are determined using future estimated advertising revenue and anticipated patterns of programming usage on a day part basis blocks of time during the day as it pertains to programming licensed to a channel 
these estimates of expected annual future estimated revenue are compared to net book value of the program license fee assets to determine if the programming assets are expected to be recovered 
where the analysis indicates the costs are in excess of the estimated net realizable value  additional programming costs are immediately recognized in the amount of the excess 

table of contents long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets  other than goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair values by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually on november or whenever an event occurs or there is a change in circumstances that indicates fair value might be below carrying value 
goodwill is carried at historical cost if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amounts 
however  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  goodwill is reduced to estimated fair value through an impairment charge to the company s consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition subscriber revenue from pay television distributors is recognized as revenue when an agreement is executed  programming is provided  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
subscriber fees from pay television distributors are recorded net of amortization of subscriber acquisition costs in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
if the amortization expense exceeds the revenue recognized on a per distributor basis  the excess amortization is included as a component of cost of services 
advertising revenue  net of agency commissions  is recognized in the period in which related commercial spots or long form programming are aired and as ratings guarantees to advertisers are achieved 
agency commissions are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue for the company s broadcasting operations 
customers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings less their commission to the company 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue or audience deficiency units 
audience deficiency unit liability audience deficiency units adus are units of inventory that are made available to advertisers as fulfillment for the inventory the advertiser purchased that ran in programs that under delivered on the guaranteed ratings 
an audience deficiency liability results when impressions delivered on guaranteed ratings are less than the impressions guaranteed to advertisers 
such liability arises as a matter of industry practice rather than as a matter of written contract 
the liability is reduced when the company airs the advertisement during another program to make good on the under delivery of impressions 
the company typically does not remit cash to advertisers in satisfaction of such deficiencies 
effects of transactions with related and certain other parties hallmark transactions in to date and in prior years  we entered into a number of significant transactions with hallmark cards and its subsidiaries

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue from continuing operations  comprised primarily of subscriber fees and advertising  increased million or in over our subscriber fee revenue increased million or as a result of an increase in the number of paying subscribers  significantly improved subscriber fee rates following renewal of all of our major distribution agreements in and  and a significant reduction in the amount of subscriber acquisition fees netted against gross subscriber revenue 
the renewed distribution agreements also sharply reduced the subscriber acquisition fees we must pay our distributors for carriage of our channels 
the amount of subscriber acquisition fees that was recorded as a reduction of subscriber fee revenue decline from million in to million in  reflecting the system by system effect of increased subscriber fee rates and reduced subscriber acquisition fees 
subscriber revenue growth in compared to will be limited to the effects of contractual increases in subscriber fee rates and increases  if any  in our distribution 
we understand that one of our distributors may file for bankruptcy in there is a risk that a sale of some of the systems under bankruptcy to other distributors may result in a decline of subscriber revenue 
see the risk factor concerning charter communications in item a  above 
the million or increase in advertising revenue reflects an increase in advertising rates along with improved delivery of committed viewership ratings and increase in the number of available general rate ad spots  offset in part by a decrease in the effectiveness of direct response advertising 
the hallmark movie channel contributed million of the increase 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of we experienced a softening of advertising rates in the scatter and direct response markets 
we believe this reflects deteriorating national economic conditions 
we expect this softening to continue throughout the relative decrease in advertising revenue in the third quarter of compared to the second quarter of was greater than the seasonal decrease we would typically have expected 
advertising revenue for the fourth quarter of was million compared to million in the fourth quarter of we have not been significantly affected by cancellations under advertising contracts 
in response to the lower advertising rates  starting in the third quarter of  we have reduced the amount of time allotted to on air self promotion and increased the time available for paid advertising 
the volume of advertising has not decreased 
for  nielsen ranked the hallmark channel th in total day viewership with a household rating and th in primetime with a household rating among the ad supported cable channels in the united states market 
although we had an increase in distribution to the nielsen universe of approximately in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of  our household ratings were down for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of we believe that the reasons for this circumstance include significant sample adjustments to viewers in determining ratings  a shift of viewers to cable news channels during the unprecedented media coverage of the national elections and the economic crisis 
our year to date household ratings were also down slightly due to the summer olympics 
cost of services 
cost of services as a percent of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decrease results from the combined effects of the increase in revenue  discussed above  and the decrease in subscriber amortization fee amortization expense discussed below 
programming costs decreased million or from largely as a result of the december   expiration of our programming agreement with nicc and our efforts to manage costs 
this was offset in part by our licensing of hallmark hall of fame movies under a new 
table of contents agreement with hallmark cards that provides year exhibition windows for all licensed films 
during the third quarter of  we entered into amendments to significant programming agreements which added programming and deferred certain payments of for program content to periods beyond subscriber acquisition fee amortization expense results from subscriber acquisition costs incurred previously by us and amortized over the remaining life of the relevant distribution agreement 
subscriber acquisition fee amortization expense decreased as all of the expense was netted against revenue in the company s three largest affiliation agreements became fully amortized during the fourth quarter of as they expired and renewal agreements were executed 
negative film amortization of million and  in and  respectively  resulted principally from the company s periodic reassessment and eventual payment of its liabilities for residuals and participations associated with the company s third party licensing and self use of it film library prior to the sale of its international film rights in april and its domestic film rights in december in  such favorable adjustments amounted to  in the second quarter and million in the third quarter 
in  such adjustment amounted to million in the third quarter 
operating costs in increased million over primarily due to a  increase in expenses associated with the distribution of the hallmark movie channel hd in high definition format and the  increase in salaries and benefits expense related to cost of living adjustments 
selling  general and administrative expense 
our selling  general and administrative expense decreased million or 
contributing to this favorable change were decreases of million in rsu expense and million in sar expense 
also contributing was a million decrease in legal expense  following our january settlement with nicc which was reflected in the year

cash flows overview operational cash flows for are expected to differ from actual results 
we anticipate that we will pay interest on our  and hallmark notes of approximately million to million during additionally  we expect to pay higher interest rates on our credit facility due to interest rate increases included in amendment no 
to our bank credit facility 
we also expect to pay more program license fee and original production amounts in primarily due to certain amendments to program license fee agreements made in due to potential fluctuations in advertising revenue from the current economic crisis  cash receipts in may be less than in the combination of these factors will decrease the amount of principal repayment under our bank credit facility as compared to to march  as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand and million of current borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility 
day to day cash disbursement requirements have typically been satisfied with cash on hand and operating cash receipts supplemented with the borrowing capacity available under the bank credit facility and forbearance by hallmark cards and its affiliates 
the company s management anticipates that the principal uses of cash up to march  will include the payment of operating expenses  accounts payable and accrued expenses  programming costs  interest and repayment of principal under the bank credit facility and interest due under certain notes to the hallmark cards affiliates 
operating activities for the years ended december  and  yielded positive cash flow 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s operating activities will continue to generate positive cash flow 
the company s principal sources of funds are cash on hand  cash generated by operations and amounts available under the company s revolving bank credit facility through march  another significant aspect of the company s liquidity is the deferral of payments on obligations owed to hallmark cards and its subsidiaries 
in march  the company and hallmark cards entered into an amended and restated waiver agreement called as amended the waiver agreement which changed the maturity date of three obligations to december   and deferred payments under these and certain other obligations 
under an amendment in march  the deferred payments under such obligations are extended to march   and additionally  payments  which may become due in the future from crown to hallmark cards under the tax sharing agreement  are added to payments deferred until march  on january   pursuant to the waiver agreement  the company paid million for interest on the  and notes that accrued from november   through december  thereafter and until maturity  interest on these notes is payable five days after each quarterly period

the waiver agreement requires that excess cash flow for a year  as defined in the waiver agreement  be used to make payments due under the bank credit facility or to pay obligations subject to the waiver agreement 
excess cash flow for is determined under the waiver agreement after deducting amounts used for these purposes during the year 
during  the company made the 
table of contents following payments totaling million net reductions in the principal of the bank credit facility of million  payments of the tax note of  and payments of interest of million on the obligations 
after these payments  there was no excess cash flow for see note the company believes that cash on hand  cash generated by operations  and borrowing availability under its bank credit facility through march   when combined with the deferral of any required payments on related party debt  any tax sharing payments  and related interest on the senior secured note described under the waiver agreement  will be sufficient to fund the company s operations and enable the company to meet its liquidity needs through march  the sufficiency of the existing sources of liquidity to fund the company s operations is dependent upon maintaining subscriber revenue at or above the amount of such revenue for the year ended december   and maintaining or increasing advertising revenue 
a significant decline in the popularity of the hallmark channel  a further economic decline in the advertising market  an increase in program acquisition costs  an increase in competition or other adverse changes in operating conditions could negatively impact the company s liquidity and its ability to fund the current level of operations 
during the last three quarters of  the company experienced a softening of advertising rates in the direct response and scatter market 
the company expects this softening to continue throughout and has identified a number of contingency cost cutting measures that could be implemented in depending on market conditions  such as decreases in the number of marketing promotions and original movies produced 
should there be a sustained recession in the united states  rising unemployment or continued declines in discretionary income  the company s revenue and margins could be significantly affected in and future years 
the company cannot predict whether  when or the manner in which the economic conditions described above will change 
bank credit facility in march  effective  april   the bank credit facility s maturity date was extended to march   and the bank s lending commitment was set at million 
based on the company s forecasts for and  which assume no principal payments on notes payable to hallmark cards and its affiliates  the company would have sufficient cash to repay all or most of the bank credit facility on the maturity date  if necessary 
however  the company s ability to pay amounts outstanding on the maturity date is highly dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient  timely cash flow from operations between january  and march  there is uncertainty in the us economy and the advertising market so it is possible that the cash flow may be less than the expectations of the company s management 
see note credit facility 
the company will endeavor to extend or refinance the bank credit facility prior to or upon its maturity 
any such extension or refinancing could require the continuing guaranty or other support from hallmark cards in regard to the bank credit facility or other steps by the company and  thus  is not assured 
upon maturity of the credit facility on march   to the extent the facility has not been paid in full  renewed or replaced  the company could require under the waiver agreement that hallmark cards purchase the interest of the lending bank in the facility 
in that case  hallmark cards would have all the obligations and rights of the lending bank under the bank credit facility and could demand payment of outstanding amounts at any time after march  under the terms of the waiver agreement 
on or after march  the company s long term obligations include notes payable to hallmark cards or affiliates of hallmark cards which are the subject of the waiver agreement 
these obligations include notes issued in  and  and tax sharing obligations which are deferred until march

because of the company s possible inability to meet its obligations when they come due on and after march  and through december   the company anticipates that prior to march   it will be necessary to either extend or refinance i the bank credit facility and ii the promissory notes payable to affiliates of hallmark cards 
as part of a combination of actions and in order to obtain additional funding  the company may consider various alternatives  including restructuring of the debt if possible  refinancing the bank credit facility  raising additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities  or other strategic alternatives 
if the current credit market conditions continue  a restructuring or refinancing could be difficult 
upon maturity of the bank credit facility on march   if not renewed or refinanced  the company will not have a comparable credit facility 
in that case  the company would be solely dependent upon day to day operating cash receipts to meets its cash requirements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only invest in instruments that meet high credit and quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these instruments  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk 
the fixed income portfolio will decline in value if there is an increase in interest rates

as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had a fair value of million  which was invested in cash and short term commercial paper 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to fund operations or can be used to reduce borrowings under our credit facility based on the maturity schedule of loans under that agreement 
consequently  the size of this portfolio is nominal and fluctuates as cash is provided by and used in our business 
the value of certain investments in this portfolio can be impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities and economic markets and interest rate fluctuations 
for the year ended december   the impact of interest rate fluctuations  changed business prospects and all other factors did not have a material impact on the fair value of this portfolio  or on our income derived from this portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes
