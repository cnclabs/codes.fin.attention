current economic environment since  the effects of the subprime mortgage and broader credit crisis have been negatively impacting the us 
concerns about the subprime mortgage market led to a liquidity crunch  which hampered businesses and contributed to investment depreciation and depressed earnings 
some of the most affected companies were investment banks  as fixed income operations were harmed due to the value decline of structured finance products  necessitating large write downs 
hedge funds  private equity firms  investment management firms and commercial banks were also affected greatly by the liquidity crunch and depressed values 

table of contents although global markets found temporary respite in the summer of  us home prices continued to fall  foreclosures and defaults began to climb  precipitating the global economic crisis 
going forward  the effects of the subprime mortgage and broader credit crisis  coupled with a decline in global gross domestic product gdp  will continue to weigh on operating results for investment services firms throughout at least fears of an uncertain timeframe for economic recovery weigh on investors 
the equity markets are still experiencing intense volatility and the credit markets remain tight amid uncertainty 
we believe that fiscal will continue to be a difficult period for the investment management industry in the united states and worldwide 
we believe that some hedge funds will go out of business and we expect that most investment managers will see their revenues decrease as a result of decreases in their assets under management 
the current turmoil in the credit markets and volatility in financial markets may also create pressure on our clients to decrease their information technology budgets  which could negatively impact our business 
while we are not immune to downturns in technology spending  should our customers reduce their spending  we believe we are well positioned to maintain our competitive position in the longer term for the following reasons our solutions are mission critical to our customers  our technology can be utilized to increase operational efficiency  as a market leader in investment management technology  we expect the customers who spend money will attempt to minimize risk and  therefore  look to our stability  reliability and scalability  we expect an increased need for systems in the face of a more regulated  compliance oriented industry  and our recurring revenue model and large customer base will continue to provide longer term stability 
longer term  we also believe that there will be additional regulation in the industry and that investment managers will be increasingly focused on servicing their customers 
these factors have traditionally been demand drivers for our products 
as the current economic situation evolves  we will continue to evaluate the impact of this environment on our business and we will remain focused on delivering solutions for our customers 
additionally  we intend to carefully manage our expenses and headcount growth 
operating overview in  we achieved a variety of operating accomplishments  including the following expanded customer relationships and acceptance of our product offerings 
in fiscal  we experienced continued strong demand for both our newest and largest portfolio management and accounting platforms advent portfolio exchange apx and geneva  respectively 
we sold new apx licenses during fiscal compared to new licenses during and new licenses in  bringing the total number of licenses sold globally to we also added new geneva clients during fiscal compared to new customers during and new customers in  bringing the total number of geneva licenses sold to as of december  selected by tiaa cref to build a service to address new regulatory challenges faced by b retirement plan administrators 
the service will use advent s custodial data acd infrastructure to aggregate data from multiple vendors to help prevent non compliant transactions before they 
table of contents occur and enable plan providers to verify compliance 
launch of the service is subject to milestones and acceptance  so we do not expect revenue to be recognized until the fourth quarter of or early  and we expect this contract to substantially increase our other recurring revenues beginning in since we will bill and collect fees as milestones are achieved  we expect deferred revenues and operating cash flows related to this contract to grow starting from the third quarter of until we begin to recognize revenues 
achieved strong bookings 
the term license contracts signed in will contribute approximately million of annual revenue annual term license contract value or acv once they are fully implemented  compared to acv of million in the tiaa cref contract  noted above  is for data services rather than a term license  and as such is not included in acv for the annual revenue from this contract  when combined with the hosted services contract previously announced with fidelity investments  are expected to contribute at least an additional million to million per year in recurring revenue beginning in the year acquired tamale software tamale 
tamale provides software solutions designed specifically to help portfolio managers and analysts easily capture  manage and share their investment ideas more effectively and access all of the firm s research more easily 
we currently have a robust portfolio of middle and back office software solutions and the acquisition of tamale represents a significant step in expanding our footprint into the front office 
repurchased our common stock 
during  we repurchased million shares under our board authorized share repurchase programs for a total cash outlay of million and an average price of per share 
financial overview we recognized revenues of million during  compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our existing term licenses  maintenance and other recurring revenues provide consistent  recurring revenue during the term of those agreements 
we have grown net revenue year over year for several reasons  including the following our product innovation helped drive acquisition of new customers and created new revenue opportunities with existing clients  resulting in incremental acv and professional services billings 
our completion of term license implementations resulted in incremental term license and professional services revenues 
we have a large installed base of customers who have upgraded and expanded their usage of our products and services  such as subscription data management and outsourcing  resulting in higher maintenance and other recurring revenues 
total recurring revenues  which we define as term license  perpetual maintenance  and other recurring revenues  increased to of total net revenues during  as compared to and during and  respectively 
we believe that our high proportion of recurring revenues allows us to take a long term view in how we conduct and invest in our business 
total expenses  including cost of revenues  were million in fiscal  compared with million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our expenses increased in over largely as a result of increased payroll  variable compensation and benefit expenses resulting from an increase in headcount as we invested in client support  product development  professional services and sales and marketing to solidify our position as a market leader 

table of contents our income from operations was million or of revenue in  compared to million or of revenue in we earned net income of million  resulting in diluted earnings per share of  compared to million or  respectively  for we generated million in cash from operations in compared to million and million  in and  respectively 
this year over year increase of in operating cash flows was primarily due to an increase in our deferred revenues which primarily reflected our continued transition to the term license model and new term license bookings 
under the term license model  we generally bill and collect for a term agreement in equal installments in advance of each annual period 
these amounts are deferred at billing and recognized over the annual term period  which has the effect of increasing deferred revenue when compared to a perpetual license model where no license revenue is deferred 
term license and term license deferral we are continuing the process of converting the company s license revenues from a perpetual model to a predominantly term model 
under a perpetual pricing model  customers purchase a license to use our software indefinitely and generally we recognize all license revenue at the time of sale  maintenance is purchased under an annual renewable contract  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
under a term pricing model  customers purchase a license to use our software and receive maintenance for a limited period of time and we recognize all of the revenue ratably over the length of the contract 
this has the effect of lowering revenues in the early stages of the transition  but increasing the total potential value of the customer relationship 
moving new customer sales in the advent investment management aim segment from a perpetual to a term licensing model has had the effect of lowering our reported revenue growth rates over the past three years and may  depending on our new term license bookings  continue to have an impact through however  because our products are used by customers for an average of approximately ten years  we believe this change to our business model is significant for the long term growth and value of the business as we expect total revenues from a customer to increase over time 
for example  over a ten year period  a customer may enter into two or more contracts for the same software product and services under a term license model 
when a customer purchases a term license together with implementation services  we do not recognize any revenue under the contract until the implementation services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete 
if the implementation services are still in progress as of quarter end  we will defer all of the contract revenues to a subsequent quarter 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years and the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
during  we deferred net revenues of million and directly related expenses of million associated with our term licensing model 
the impact of these deferrals on our operating income was approximately million 
the million net deferral of revenue is composed of a net deferral of million of professional services revenue and a net deferral of million of term license revenue 
we expect that the term license component of the deferred revenue balance will increase or decrease in the future depending on the amount of new bookings relative to the number of implementations that reach substantial completion in a particular quarter 
we currently expect that the professional services component of the deferred revenue balance will continue to increase through at least 
table of contents amounts of revenues and directly related expenses deferred as of december  and associated with our term licensing deferral were as follows in millions december  december  deferred revenues short term long term total directly related expenses short term long term total deferred net revenues and directly related expenses are classified as deferred revenues short term and long term  and prepaid expenses and other  and other assets  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
the transition to a term model also has the effect of decreasing operating cash flows in the early stages of the transition 
under perpetual pricing  the entire license fee and the first year of maintenance is generally billed and collected at the commencement of the arrangement 
under term pricing  a typical contract term is three years 
we generally bill and collect term license fee installments in advance of each annual period 
the amount of the annual term billing is less than the perpetual billing  resulting in lower cash flows in the initial annual term license period 
annual term billing results in an increase in deferred revenues and an increase in operating cash flows at the commencement of each annual billing period

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the process we use to develop estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other information that we believe is reasonable for making judgments at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from our estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenues  income taxes  stock based compensation  restructuring charges and related accruals  business combinations  goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  legal contingencies  and sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies contain our most significant judgments and estimates 
our revenue policy is further described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from term license  maintenance and other recurring  perpetual license fees  and professional services and other 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our lower priced license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our application of generally accepted accounting principles 
software licenses 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we generally use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor s customers 
revenue is recognized once shipment to the distributor s customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs when a product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point  or upon confirmation that product delivered fob shipping destination has been received  or upon notification that software is available for electronic download 
table of contents through our fulfillment vendor 
some of our arrangements include acceptance provisions  and if such acceptance provisions are present  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess whether the collectability of the resulting receivable is probable based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports  our transaction history with the customer  other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the united states 
our standard payment terms are due at days or less  but payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
software licenses are sold with maintenance and  frequently  professional services 
we typically license our products on a per server  per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed  the assets under administration  the number of site installations and the number of authorized users 
we have continued our transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of term and perpetual licenses  and we expect term license revenue to increase as a proportion of total recurring revenues which we define as term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues in the future 
term license revenue comprised approximately  and of total recurring revenues in  and  respectively 
revenue recognition for software licensed under term and perpetual license models differs depending on which type of contract a customer signs term licenses term license contracts include both the software license and maintenance services 
we offer multi year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment that typically spans three years 
for multi year term licenses  we have not established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for the software license and maintenance components and  as a result  in situations where we are also performing related professional services  we defer all revenue and directly related expenses under the arrangement until the implementation services are complete and the remaining services are substantially complete 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
we determine whether services are substantially complete by consulting with the professional services group and applying management judgment 
term license revenue for the remaining contract years and the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
when multi year term licenses are sold and do not include related professional services  we recognize the entire term license revenue ratably over the period of the contract term from the effective date of the license agreement assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenues from term licenses are included in term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues on the consolidated statement of operations 
perpetual licenses we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual method  based on vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services components  which is specific to us 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the company s stand alone sales of these elements to third parties and or renewal rates 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that element has occurred unless the only undelivered element is maintenance 
revenues from perpetual licenses are included in perpetual license fees revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents certain of our perpetual and term license contracts include asset based fee structures that provide additional revenues based on the assets that the client manages using our software assets under administration or aua 
contracts containing an aua fee structure have a defined measurement period which requires the client to self report actual aua in arrears of the specified period 
aua fees above the stated minimum fee for the same period are considered incremental fees 
because incremental fees are not determinable until the conclusion of the measurement period  they are both earned and recognized upon completion of the measurement period  on a quarterly or annual basis 
incremental fees from perpetual aua contracts are included in perpetual license fees on the consolidated statement of operations 
incremental fees from term aua contracts are included in term license  maintenance and other recurring revenue on the consolidated statement of operations 
for contracts signed prior to  the company recognizes both the minimum and incremental value of the aua fees upon receipt of the customer s aua report 
in  the company concluded that it gained sufficient experience in working with these types of arrangements to conclude that the minimum fees are fixed and determinable at inception of the contract instead of upon conclusion of the measurement period 
therefore  for contracts signed since  the company recognizes aua contract minimum fees over the period of service and continues to recognize incremental fees in arrears once clients contractually report the aua to the company  because the incremental fees are not determinable until reported 
if a customer purchased our software and chose to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through the company s in house broker dealer subsidiary  second street securities  the soft dollar arrangement did not change or modify the original fixed or determinable fee in the written contract 
the customer is required to pay the original fee for the company s software within one year 
if insufficient trading volume is generated to pay the entire original fee within one year  the customer is still required to render payment within one year 
in  advent completed the wind down of its soft dollar business 
however  customers may continue to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through a third party broker dealer to purchase advent s software 
the original payment terms apply  regardless of the arrangement with the third party broker dealer 
the option to soft dollar a transaction does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction  all the revenue recognition criteria listed in the software licenses section above must be assessed in determining how the revenue will be recognized 
maintenance and other recurring revenues 
we offer annual maintenance programs on perpetual licenses that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are bundled with perpetual license fees in the initial licensing year and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
fair value for maintenance is based upon either renewal rates stated in the contracts or separate sales of renewals to customers 
generally  we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term 
we offer other recurring revenue services that are either subscription based or transaction based  and primarily include the provision of software interfaces to  and the capability to download securities information from  third party data providers 
we recognize revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur based on the terms of the arrangement 
professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
we base fair value for professional services upon separate sales of these services to customers 
our professional services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
we recognize revenue as professional services are performed  except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria and in these cases  revenue and 
table of contents related expenses are recognized upon acceptance 
professional services and other revenues also include revenue from our user conferences 
directly related expenses 
when we defer service revenues  we also defer the direct costs incurred in the delivery of those services to the extent those costs are recoverable through the future revenues on non cancelable contracts as prepaid contract expense 
we recognize those deferred costs as costs of professional services revenues proportionally and over the same period that the deferred revenue is recognized as service revenue 
when we defer license revenue  we defer the direct incremental costs incurred as a result of selling the contract ie sales commissions earned by the sales force as a part of their overall compensation because those costs would not have been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract 
we recognize those costs as sales and marketing expense proportionally and over the same period as the license revenues 
income taxes 
we account for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities to be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
many of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that have differing or preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to the appropriate taxing jurisdictions to reasonably allocate earnings 
additionally  the projections of pre tax income for the year by legal entity can vary significantly from quarter to quarter which can have a significant impact on our projected effective tax rate 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable  the final outcome could be different from that which is reflected in our income tax provision and accruals 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable future income in the jurisdiction where the tax asset is located 
we consider forecasted earnings  future taxable income and prudent and reasonable tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the return is filed and the tax implication is known 
we are subject to audits by state  federal and foreign tax authorities 
our estimates for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax matter are judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options  stock appreciation rights sar and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee exercise behavior  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on an equally weighted average of historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock 
we determined that a blend of historical and implied volatility is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility 
table of contents than using purely historical volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options and sars granted based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we base the risk free interest rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option and sar 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
these variables are sensitive and change on a daily basis 
as a result  the financial result from issuing the same number of options or sars can vary significantly over time 
the following table reflects the change in the fair value of a hypothetical option or sar as a result of a hypothetical change in one of the underlying assumptions assumption base case assumption change value change assumption change value change grant and stock price risk free interest rate volatility expected life years year year expected dividend yield base option value our sar and stock option awards granted to employees cliff vest after one year and monthly thereafter over the next months 
our restricted stock unit rsu awards cliff vest after two years and after four years 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on our annual forfeiture rate 
the annual forfeiture rate is based on our historical forfeiture experience over the last ten years 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
a decrease in our annual forfeiture rate assumption would increase stock based compensation expense 
the estimated impact of a hypothetical basis point decrease in the annual forfeiture rate on stock based compensation expense would have been an increase of approximately million 
restructuring charges and related accruals 
we have developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
business combinations 
when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are 
table of contents inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
goodwill 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as of november and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we had three reporting units as of november  the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including the development of future revenue and expense forecasts used to calculate future cash flows  the selection of risk adjusted discount rates  and determination of market comparable entities 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment for any of our reporting units 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
determining whether an impairment trigger has occurred is subjective and requires judgment 
our recoverability test compares the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
we estimate future revenue and expense amounts to calculate future cash flows 
we believe our forecast revenue and expense amounts are reasonable but forecast amounts are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
legal contingencies 
from time to time  advent is involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we use our judgment to assess both the likelihood and potential amount of a contingency 
we periodically review our assessment whenever there is a change in the facts and circumstances of these proceedings 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future 
were an unfavorable outcome to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs  and potentially in future periods 
sales returns and accounts receivable allowances 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  allowed customers to return software on a limited case by case basis and have recorded sales returns provisions as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable 
we use our judgment in estimating our sales returns 
we analyze customer demand  acceptance of products and historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which are not generally provided to customers 
beginning in  we implemented a methodology to supplement our judgment for calculating the value of reserves that considered the last months of experience into account 
beginning in the second quarter of  we changed our methodology to include the last months of return experience 
our ability to estimate returns is based on our long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon changes in historical rates of returns and other related factors 
we 
table of contents have recorded a sales returns provision benefit to decrease increase revenue for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we use our judgment in estimating our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze specific accounts receivables  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we have recorded a provision for bad debt expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation to better reflect our view of the current business 
these reclassifications do not affect total net revenues  net income  cash flows  or stockholders equity 
please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a complete description of the reclassifications 

table of contents results of operations for fiscal years  and the following table summarizes  for the periods indicated  certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues 
the financial information and the ensuing discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
fiscal years net revenues term license  maintenance and other recurring perpetual license fees professional services and other total net revenues cost of revenues term license  maintenance and other recurring perpetual license fees professional services and other amortization and impairment of developed technology total cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of other intangibles acquired in process research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense interest income and other  net gain on sale of equity investments income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income less than 
table of contents net revenues in thousands  except percentages total net revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year our net revenues are made up of three components term license  maintenance and other recurring revenue  perpetual license fees  and professional services and other revenue 
the revenues from a term license  which includes both software license and maintenance  are recorded under a time based contract 
maintenance revenues are derived from maintenance fees charged for perpetual license arrangements and recurring revenues are derived from our subscription based or transaction based services 
perpetual license fee revenues are derived from the licensing of software products under a perpetual arrangement 
professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting  training services and our client conferences 
sales returns  which we generally do not provide to customers  are accounted for as deductions to these three revenue categories based on our historical experience 
prior to fiscal  each of the major revenue categories varied significantly as a percentage of net revenues 
since fiscal  revenues from recurring sources have grown from in  to in and to in as we continue to sign term license agreements for new customers  grow our subscription  data management and outsourced services revenues  and our customers renew their perpetual maintenance  we expect our revenue from recurring sources to continue to increase as a percentage of net revenues and therefore we expect less variability between our major categories of revenues 
net revenues increased in and due to continued customer adoption for many of our products and services  which principally includes increases in sales of our apx and geneva products 
during  we sold apx licenses and added new geneva clients 
the year over year growth in total net revenues for was due principally to substantially higher term license  maintenance and other recurring revenues  which reflected and growth in term license revenues during and  respectively

the net effect  assuming most customers renew their contracts upon expiration of the initial term  is to build a long term license and maintenance stream and also enhance predictability of our revenues

the and increases in aim s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  reflected the continued market acceptance of our axys  apx  moxy  partner and geneva products as well as increased international sales 
the key driver behind the increase in aim revenue was the continued growth in term revenues as described in the term  maintenance and other recurring revenue section above 
term revenues increased million in  and accounted for of the growth in aim revenue 
the and increases in microedge revenues in fiscal and  respectively  primarily reflected an increase in perpetual license sales in microedge s core product  gifts  and to a lesser extent an increase in maintenance revenues due to price increases and continued strong customer retention 
the technology spending patterns of organizations in microedge s primary markets independent foundations  community foundations and corporations are directly affected by economic fluctuations as foundation budgets are largely driven by endowment income 
given that endowments often contain market exposed components  they are significantly affected by the economy and foundation spending typically decreases in an economic downturn 
community foundations are subject to similar influences  compounded by the fact that in many cases much of their ongoing funding and endowment comes from active donors who may increase or reduce their giving depending on the economic climate and the related effect on their income and wealth 
corporations typically fund charitable activities from operating budgets  and the allocation to charitable donations and supporting company charitable operations is often closely tied to a company s performance 
thus  corporate philanthropy and spending on related technology are correlated with company and overall economic performance

table of contents our cost of revenues is made up of four components cost of term license  maintenance and other revenues  cost of perpetual license fees  cost of professional services and other  and amortization and impairment of developed technology 
the increase in total cost of revenues in absolute dollars was due principally to headcount additions in our client support and services groups to support our increased new term license bookings and associated increase in client implementation projects as well as heads added through our tamale acquisition 
to a lesser extent  increased amortization and impairment charges associated with our developed technology also contributed to the overall increase 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in resulted principally from our shift in revenue mix and the increase in amortization and impairment of developed technology 
professional services and other revenue comprised a greater percentage of total revenues in and due to growth of and  respectively 
we are currently experiencing negative gross margins on professional services revenues as we defer revenues and direct costs associated with services performed on term license implementations

cost of maintenance and other recurring revenues is primarily comprised of the direct costs of providing technical support services under maintenance agreements and other services for recurring revenues  and royalties paid to third party subscription based and transaction based vendors 
cost of term license  maintenance and other recurring fluctuated due to the following in thousands change from to change from to increased payroll and related increased allocation of infrastructure expenses increased decreased royalties increased depreciation increased outside services increased travel and entertainment increased computers and telecom various other items total change the increases in and were due primarily to an increase in compensation and related costs resulting from increases in salary costs and headcount which enables us to deliver the services we provide to our growing number of clients in their day to day use of our software 
headcount has grown to employees heads from tamale acquisition at december  from employees at december  and employees at december   respectively  which has also contributed to increased allocation of corporate facility and it costs

we expect these fees to decrease slightly in as a result of our continuing transition away from perpetual licensing 
cost of professional services and other in thousands  except percentages cost of professional services and other percent of total professional services revenues change over prior year percent change over prior year cost of professional services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel related costs associated with the client services organization in providing consulting  custom report writing and conversions of data from clients previous systems

cost of professional services and other fluctuated due to the following in thousands change from to change from to increased payroll and related increased outside services increased travel and entertainment increased decreased service cost deferral related to term implementations increased decreased recruiting increased decreased marketing various other items total change the increases in and primarily reflects the higher costs from payroll and related expenses and higher utilization of outside services  such as third parties to assist in our professional services projects 
travel and entertainment expenses increased in and due to a general increase in demand for consulting and training services resulting from higher term license contract sales 
payroll and related costs increased during the year due to an increase in headcount and the increased use of external consultants 
during the latter half of  we hired a significant number of 
table of contents consultants resulting in the increased payroll costs in and headcount in our consulting group increased to at december   from at december  and at december   respectively 
recruiting and marketing activity in our consulting group decreased in compared to  resulting in lower recruiting and marketing expenses for the year 
we have experienced an increase in implementation services with the launch of our apx product and sales of our geneva product  which are both sold under the term license model 
a larger number of implementation projects were completed in relative to  resulting in a smaller amount of deferred professional services costs during compared to we deferred net professional service costs of million during compared to million and million during and  respectively 
professional services gross margins for and improved but continue to be negative as a result of the significant deferral of professional services revenues and costs associated with our term license implementation 
we defer only the direct costs associated with services performed on these arrangements 
indirect costs such as management and other overhead expenses are recognized in the period in which they are incurred  with no revenue to offset them 
as the deferred professional services revenue and expense associated with our term licenses continue to flow back into our operating results  we believe the margin will continue to improve over time 
in addition  headcount in our consulting group has increased during  and to a lesser degree  in since these new employees undergo a training period  typically of six months  before becoming fully billable  their associated costs have a near term negative impact on gross margins 
we expect cost of professional services and other in to decrease in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue as compared to  as we expect to decrease our billable headcount but increase our utilization  and decrease conference expenses due to the cancellation of our advent client conference

the increases in payroll and related expense were a result of an increase in headcount to at december  from and at december  and  respectively  and increases in variable compensation paid to these individuals as a result of higher bookings 
we believe this investment in personnel will accelerate the momentum in our geneva and apx product sales and increase customer satisfaction for all of our products 
increases in headcount also contributed to additional costs incurred by our sales and marketing group from allocated infrastructure expense information technology and facilities in and travel expenses increased during the past two years due to more employees attending the advent client conference in and resulting in higher travel and lodging costs 
the increase in outside services during reflects a million cancellation fee for the advent client conference which we decided  in the fourth quarter of  to suspend 
during  we referred more accounts to collections which resulted in our increased provision for bad debt compared to the fluctuations in broker fees during fiscal were primarily associated with the winding down of our soft dollar business in fiscal marketing expenses decreased in compared to due to advertising initiatives to market our significant number of product releases in in  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in dollar amount but remain relatively flat as a percentage of total net revenues compared with  as we increase our marketing activities

we account for product development costs in accordance with sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which specifies that costs incurred to develop computer software products should be charged to expense as incurred until technological feasibility is reached for the products 
once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
the capitalized costs will be amortized using the greater of the ratio of the product s current gross revenues to the total of current expected gross revenues or on a straight line basis over the software s estimated economic life of approximately three years 
product development expenses fluctuated due to the following in thousands change from to change from to increased payroll and related increased outside services increased allocation of infrastructure expenses increased computers and telecommunications increased travel and entertainment increased capitalization of product development increased decreased recruiting various other items total change the increase in product development expense during fiscal and was primarily due to increases in payroll and other related costs resulting from the increase in headcount employees as a result of the tamale acquisition and utilization of outside services  primarily a vendor located in china  to help us continue to enhance our existing product suite including new versions of geneva  apx  moxy  advent partner  and advent revenue center 
headcount increased to at december  from and at december  and  respectively 
as a result of the increase in headcount  our product development group incurred additional costs from allocated infrastructure expense information technology and facilities 
however  as the headcount growth in was primarily due to headcount added from the tamale acquisition  our external recruiting fees decreased in resulting from less hiring activity compared to we invested of our revenues in product development during  and  respectively

the headcount increase to at december  from at december  reflected our investment in information technology infrastructure to assist in automating key business processes to support the company s growth 
as a result of the increase in headcount  general and administrative incurred additional costs from recruiting costs 
additionally  our loss on disposal of assets during increased due to the aforementioned write off of construction in progress assets at our second street facility in san francisco  california 
these increases in expense were offset by a decrease in facilities and depreciation expense as we are no longer incurring rent and depreciation expenses related to our prior san francisco headquarters facility located at brannan street  which we exited in october we entered into a definitive lease agreement in january for our new headquarters facility located at townsend street in san francisco  california resulting in rent expense at both townsend and our prior

cash flows resulting from changes in assets and liabilities included increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable 
the increase in deferred revenue primarily reflected our continued transition to the term license model 
under the term model  we generally bill and collect for a term agreement in equal installments in advance of each annual period 
these amounts are deferred at billing and recognized over the annual term period 
this has the effect of increasing deferred revenue when compared to a perpetual license model where no license revenue is deferred 
see further discussion of the effects of our transition to a term model in the overview section

the increase in accrued liabilities primarily reflected increases in accrued bonuses and restructuring expenses relating to the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
other adjustments to cash flows resulting from changes in assets and liabilities included an increase in deferred taxes of million primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results  new term license bookings that increase deferred revenue  collection of accounts receivable  and timing of payments

net cash used in financing activities in of million reflected the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million  partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock of million 
our liquidity and capital resources in any period could be affected by the exercise of outstanding employee stock options and sars  and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares from this and from the issuance of common stock from our rsus could also affect our per share results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the exercise of these securities  or whether they will be exercised at all

in january  we repaid million of the debt under the credit facility resulting in a million balance as of february  the remaining outstanding debt is due at the end of the credit facility term in february we expect that for the next year  our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow 
in addition  we may use cash to fund other acquisitions  repurchase additional common stock  or invest in other businesses  when opportunities arise 
based upon the predominance of our revenues from recurring sources  term license bookings performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases and financing activities for the next year 
however  if we identify opportunities that exceed our current expectation  we may choose to seek additional capital resources through equity or debt financing 
however  such financing may not be available at all particularly in the current economic environment  or if available may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us and could be dilutive 
common stock repurchases advent s board has approved common stock repurchase programs authorizing management to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of advent s management and are contingent on a number of factors and limitations  including the price of advent s stock  corporate and regulatory requirements  alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions 
the stock repurchase programs specify a maximum number of shares subject to repurchase  do not have an expiration date and may be 
table of contents limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
repurchased shares are returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
the purchases are funded from available working capital 
the purchase price for the shares of our common stock repurchased was reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 status of accounting research bulletins  we are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as i an increase to accumulated deficit and ii a reduction of common stock and additional paid in capital 
issuance of common stock and the tax benefit related to employee stock option plans are recorded as an increase to common stock and additional paid in capital 
as a result of future repurchases  we may continue to report an accumulated deficit included in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following is a summary of the repurchase programs authorized by the board since fiscal in thousands date of authorization number of shares authorized april july february may october total the following is a summary of the company s repurchase activity since fiscal in thousands  except per share data fiscal year total number of shares repurchased cost average price paid per share total at december   there remained  shares authorized by the board for repurchase off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands fiscal years thereafter total operating lease obligations  net of sub lease income debt total 
table of contents as of december   the principal outstanding under our credit facility agreement was million which is due in full no later than february  interest associated with this agreement cannot be estimated with certainty by period throughout the term since it is based on a fluctuating interest rate calculation 
at december  and december   we had a gross liability of million and million  respectively  for uncertain tax positions associated with the adoption of fin if recognized  the impact on our statement of operations would be to decrease our income tax expense and increase our net income by million 
the impact on net income reflects the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits net of the federal tax benefit of state income tax items 
since almost all of this liability relates to reserves against deferred tax assets that we do not expect to utilize in the short term  we cannot estimate the timing of potential future cash settlements and have not included any estimates in the table of contractual cash obligations above 
additionally  with the exception of california discussed below  our cash payments for income taxes will continue to be nominal until at least as we have significant net operating losses  capital losses and tax credit carryforwards to utilize 
on september   california enacted tax law changes that suspended the utilization of california net operating losses and limited the utilization of california tax credits to of our tax liability for the and tax periods 
as a result  we expect to pay cash income taxes in california related to fiscal and but do not expect the amount to exceed  for either year 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
historically  much of our revenues and capital spending was transacted in us dollars 
however  since the acquisitions of advent denmark  advent norway  advent sweden  advent netherlands  and advent europe s remaining distributors in the united kingdom and switzerland  whose service and certain license revenues and capital spending  are transacted in local country currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally as of december   million and million of goodwill and intangibles from the acquisition of these entities are denominated in foreign currency 
therefore a hypothetical change of could increase or decrease our assets and equity by million and could increase or decrease our consolidated results of operations or cash flows by approximately million 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  cash equivalent securities were comprised of overnight us government and treasury obligation money market mutual funds which would not be materially affected by an immediate sharp increase or decrease in interest rates 
effective november  we also have interest rate risk relating to debt under our credit facility which is indexed to the wells fargo prime rate 
as of december   we had million borrowed against the facility 

table of contents we have also invested in several privately held companies 
these non marketable investments are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our investments in privately held companies could be affected by an adverse movement in the financial markets for publicly traded equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products these privately held companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is our policy to review investments in privately held companies on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
our investments in privately held companies are assessed for impairment when a review of the investee s operations indicates that a decline in value of the investment is other than temporary 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  limited prospects of receiving additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying revenue and price earnings multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies 
during the second quarter of  we received the initial deferred contingent payment as a result of the sale of our investment in april in latentzero limited 
at december   our net investments in privately held companies totaled million
