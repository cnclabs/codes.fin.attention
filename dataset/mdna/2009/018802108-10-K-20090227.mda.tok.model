severe midwest weather general in june  the midwest experienced severe flooding  tornadoes and thunderstorms that impacted the operations of several alliant energy companies  including ipl  wpl and resources 
the severe weather was most significant in iowa and resulted in significant property damage to generating facilities  distribution substations and railroad infrastructure  the loss of electric and steam sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations and the destruction of homes and businesses  the evacuation of and damage to various office and operational facilities  and the disruption of short haul railroad services 
alliant energy has restored service to those customers in its service territory that are capable of receiving service and currently expects the rebuilding and business continuity activities associated with its damaged properties to continue for several months 
property damage property damage from the severe weather was scattered throughout alliant energy s service territory with the most significant impacts occurring in the cedar rapids  iowa area where the cedar river crested approximately feet above flood stage on june  exceeding the year flood plain boundaries 
property damaged by the severe weather included  among other assets  the following key facilities and their contents ipl s prairie creek and sixth street generating stations  ipl s general office building  ipl s electrical distribution operations center  resources railroad bridge over the cedar river and several of ipl s distribution substations 
in  estimated retirements of utility plant damaged by the severe weather were charged to accumulated depreciation and estimates of all other assets damaged by the severe weather were charged to operating expenses 
alliant energy will charge future costs to acquire replacement property to property  plant and equipment and future costs to repair damaged property to operating expense as these costs are incurred 
generating facility impacts ipl s sutherland generating station in marshalltown  iowa was shutdown for approximately two weeks during june due to flooding at the facility  but has since been restored to full operations with no significant damage to the facility from the flooding 
ipl s prairie creek and sixth street generating stations in cedar rapids  iowa were also shutdown in june and have not yet returned to full operations due to significant damage to the facilities caused by the severe flooding 
ipl expects its prairie creek generating station to return to full operations in the first half of in january  ipl announced it did not secure the necessary long term contracts with steam customers serviced by the sixth street generating station in order to make the investment required to rebuild such facility 
ipl is currently in discussions with steam customers regarding providing short to mid term steam service and is assessing its options at the sixth street generating station relative to providing electrical production with alternative fuel sources 
ipl s prairie creek and sixth street generating stations represented approximately mw  or less than  of ipl s summer electric generating capability and substantially all of ipl s steam generating capability prior to their shutdown in june ipl has been procuring replacement purchased power as required while the prairie creek and sixth street generating stations are offline to satisfy its electric load requirements 
ipl leased a limited number of small standby generating units during the summer electric peaking season to contribute to the reliability of the electric grid in the cedar rapids area 
the incremental costs of procuring replacement purchased power and the fuel to power the leased standby generating units are charged to electric production fuel and purchased power expense and are expected to be recovered from retail electric customers in accordance with ipl s utility fuel cost recovery mechanism resulting in no material impact on ipl s electric margins 
the incremental costs of leasing the small standby generating units were charged to operating expenses 
following the flooding  ipl began leasing replacement steam generating systems natural gas fired package boilers and water treatment systems to produce steam to meet the demand of its steam customers in the cedar rapids area 
in february  the prairie creek generating station resumed steam generating capability allowing ipl to discontinue leasing a portion of the replacement steam generating systems 
ipl expects to continue leasing the portion of the replacement steam generating system providing steam to customers previously serviced by the sixth street generating station to meet its obligations under new short term contracts that allow ipl to recover the incremental leasing and fuel costs incurred to resume temporary steam service 
sales impacts temporary disruptions of electric and steam services associated with the severe weather caused alliant energy s and ipl s operating revenues to be lower than anticipated beginning in june at the peak of the disruptions caused by the severe weather  approximately  electric customers of ipl were unable to receive service 
ipl also has approximately steam customers in cedar rapids  who take high pressure steam for production purposes or low pressure steam for hot water and heat that lost service in june when the prairie creek and sixth street generating stations were shutdown 
the most significant impacts of these disruptions on revenues related to several large industrial customers in the cedar rapids area who were unable to receive service 
alliant energy has restored service to all customers in its service territory except approximately  customers that are not capable of receiving service as a result of damage to their properties caused by the flooding 
insurance coverage alliant energy s property insurance policy provides coverage up to million for covered flood losses  subject to a million deductible per occurrence and certain sub limits  most notably a million sub limit for covered losses related to temporary replacement equipment and facilities 
covered property generally includes generating assets  substations  office and operating buildings and non fuel inventories  including costs incurred to protect  repair or replace such property 
property not covered generally includes the electric distribution system  railroad infrastructure  vehicles and fuel 
in addition  alliant energy does not have any business interruption coverage for lost revenues from the disruption of service 
at the end of each reporting period during the restoration activities  alliant energy plans to record a receivable for the amount of flood losses recognized to date that are recorded in operating expenses and considered probable of future recovery under the insurance policy 
the offsetting credit to this receivable will be recorded to operating expenses to offset the operating expenses used to support the receivable 
in addition  the offsetting credit to any insurance proceeds received that are recoveries of expenditures charged to capital accounts for restoration activities related to flood damages will be recorded to accumulated depreciation 
any expenditure for covered flood losses incurred subsequent to alliant energy reaching its million aggregate limit or any applicable sub limits will not be offset by any portion of the credits from insurance recoveries 
in  ipl received payments of million for reimbursement of covered flood losses under the alliant energy property insurance policy 
in addition  ipl recognized million of receivables as of dec 
 for operating expenses incurred during that are expected to be reimbursed with a future property insurance payment 
cost recovery mechanisms alliant energy and ipl have several mechanisms to mitigate the adverse financial impacts of the severe midwest weather 
first  alliant energy has property insurance to cover a portion of the flood losses 
second  ipl s utility fuel cost recovery mechanism allows it to recover the cost of replacement purchased power and fuel for standby generating units from its electric customers 
third  ipl has entered into new short term contracts with a portion of its steam customers that allow ipl to recover the incremental costs incurred for natural gas fired package boilers and water treatment systems required to resume steam service 
finally  ipl is evaluating regulatory options for cost recovery of any remaining costs from the severe midwest weather not covered by the recovery mechanisms above 
financial impacts the total cost of the severe weather in june was approximately million for these costs are largely due to the operating and capital expenditures required to restore operations  expenditures for replacement purchased power due to generating facility outages and lost operating margins due to disruptions in electric and steam service 
based on the financial impacts of the severe weather in june and the cost recovery mechanisms noted above  alliant energy s utilities earnings decreased by approximately per share primarily due to reductions in electric and steam margins from disruptions in service caused by the severe flooding in the cedar rapids area and operating expenses for restoration activities that may not be recoverable from cost recovery mechanisms 
alliant energy s capital expenditures increased by approximately million associated with rebuilding activities following the severe flooding 
alliant energy and ipl do not believe additional expenditures for restoration activities and loss of revenues from service disruptions associated with the severe flooding will have a significant impact on their liquidity given their current liquidity positions and the cost recovery mechanisms noted above  most notably the remaining anticipated proceeds from the property insurance policy 
the financial impacts of the severe weather in june did not have a material impact on wpl s or resources results of operations and cash flows 
alliant energy and ipl anticipate financial impacts in from restoration activities associated with the severe midwest weather  but are currently unable to determine what these impacts will be on their financial condition  results of operations or cash flows due to several uncertainties  most notably the timing and nature operating versus capital of expenditures for restoration activities that may not be recoverable from cost recovery mechanisms and uncertainties regarding the future options for its sixth street generating station 
strategic overview summary alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s corporate strategy focuses on the execution of their infrastructure investment program  while meeting or exceeding customers and regulators expectations regarding reliability  availability  customer service and community support 
the infrastructure investment program reflects a balanced approach to meeting the needs of its customers  shareowners and the environment and includes the following key components new electric generating facilities the infrastructure investment program includes building or acquiring several electric generating facilities to meet customer demand and renewable portfolio standards  reduce reliance on purchased power and mitigate any impacts of future plant retirements 
alliant energy s proposed new electric generating facilities have a diversified fuel mix and currently include several wind projects in the midwest  two natural gas fired generating facilities in wisconsin and the sutherland generating facility  which would burn coal and biomass 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe a diversified fuel mix for new electric generating facilities is important to meeting the needs of their customers  shareowners and the environment while preparing for a potentially carbon constrained environment in the future 
additional details of new electric generating facilities are included in utility generation plan below 
new air pollution controls the infrastructure investment program also includes implementing air pollution controls at ipl s and wpl s existing fleet of electric generating facilities to meet current and proposed environmental regulations issued by the epa and state environmental agencies

air pollution control projects under construction lansing generating station unit lansing unit in  ipl announced plans to install a scr system and baghouse at lansing unit to reduce nox and mercury emissions  respectively  at the generating facility 
the scr system for lansing unit was included in ipl s amended epb approved by the iub in november the baghouse for lansing unit was included in ipl s epb approved by the iub in october total capital expenditures  excluding afudc  for the lansing unit air pollution controls are currently estimated to be million million for controls to reduce nox and million for controls to reduce mercury 
as of dec 
  alliant energy and ipl had million of capitalized expenditures for the scr system at lansing unit recorded in cwip on their respective consolidated balance sheets 
remaining capital expenditures for lansing unit s air pollution controls are included in the above estimates for alliant energy s and ipl s multi emission compliance plans 
the scr system and baghouse at lansing unit are expected to be completed by the second quarter of air pollution control projects submitted for pscw approval nelson dewey in  wpl filed a construction application with the pscw to install a scrubber and baghouse at the two existing units at nelson dewey to reduce so and mercury emissions  respectively  at the generating facility 
total capital expenditures  excluding afudc  for the nelson dewey air pollution controls are currently estimated to be million million for controls to reduce so and million for controls to reduce mercury and are included in the above estimates for alliant energy s and wpl s multi emission compliance plans 
edgewater generating station unit edgewater unit in the fourth quarter of  wpl filed a construction application with the pscw to install a scr system at edgewater unit to reduce nox emissions at the facility 
total capital expenditures  excluding afudc  for the scr at edgewater unit are currently estimated to be million and are included in the above estimates for alliant energy s and wpl s multi emission compliance plans 
rates and regulatory matters overview alliant energy has two utility subsidiaries  ipl and wpl 
alliant energy s utility subsidiaries are subject to federal regulation by ferc  which has jurisdiction over wholesale electric rates  electric transmission and certain natural gas facilities  and state regulation in iowa  wisconsin and minnesota for retail utility rates and standards of service 
such regulatory oversight also covers ipl s and wpl s plans for construction and financing of new generation facilities and related activities

b refer to wpl s wholesale rate case below for additional information 
wpl s fuel related retail rate case in march  wpl filed a request with the pscw to increase annual retail electric rates by million to recover anticipated increased electric fuel and purchased energy costs fuel related costs 
actual fuel related costs through february  combined with projections of continued higher fuel related costs for the remainder of  significantly exceeded the amounts being recovered in retail electric rates at the time of the filing 
in the second quarter of  wpl received an order from the pscw authorizing the requested million interim increase  subject to refund  effective in april fuel related costs incurred by wpl in subsequent to the implementation of the interim rate increase were significantly lower than anticipated resulting in refunds owed to its retail electric customers 
in january  wpl received approval from the pscw to pay an million interim refund to retail electric customers in the first quarter of in february  wpl also filed a final fuel refund report  including interest less the interim refund amount  resulting in a final residual refund of million in addition to the interim refund 
pending pscw approval  wpl will refund the remaining million  including interest  in the second quarter of as of dec 
  wpl reserved million  including interest  for refunds anticipated to be paid to its retail electric customers based upon its estimate of the final order 
wpl anticipates receiving the final order from the pscw in the first quarter of and completing any remaining refunds in the second quarter of wpl s retail rate case in february  wpl filed a request with the pscw to increase current retail electric rates by million  or approximately  and reduce current retail gas rates by million  or approximately  effective jan 
 the electric request was based on a test year with approval to reopen the case to address limited cost drivers for the electric request reflected recovery for increased projected spending on electric generation infrastructure  environmental compliance and stewardship  enhanced investment in renewable energy projects  stepped up customer energy efficiency and conservation efforts  and related electric transmission and distribution costs 
the gas request was based on an average of and projected costs 
the request was based on the previously authorized return on common equity of 
through the course of the pscw audit  the request was updated for various new cost estimates and removal of capital projects that had not yet been approved by the pscw 
these projects include bent tree  nelson dewey subsequently rejected by the pscw in december and various environmental compliance projects 
any projects that receive approval in are expected to be included in a planned test year base rate case 
in december  wpl and major intervenors in the case reached a stipulated agreement on electric and gas rate changes for the parties agreed to hold retail electric rates flat and decrease retail gas rates by million 
the stipulated agreement also included a provision that authorizes wpl to defer  and record carrying costs on  the retail portion of pension and benefit costs in excess of million  any change in the retail portion of network wheeling costs charged by atc that is different than million and any change in the retail portion of emission allowance expense that is different than million 
in addition  the stipulated agreement included the recovery of million over a two year period for pre certification costs related to the nelson dewey project that had been incurred through december lastly  the stipulated agreement provides an option for wpl to file for a full test year rate case  instead of the limited reopener that was part of the original rate case filing 
the pscw approved the stipulations in december wpl s retail rate case in april  wpl filed a request with the pscw to reopen its retail rate case for the limited purpose of increasing electric retail rates in an amount equal to deferral credits that were fully amortized on dec 
 wpl also requested clarification that it is authorized to record afudc on all cwip balances in excess of the cwip balance included in the test year 
in november  the pscw issued a final written order approving an annual electric retail rate increase of million effective jan 
 and approving wpl s requested clarification regarding afudc and cwip 
wpl s wholesale rate case in december  wpl received an order from ferc authorizing an interim rate increase  subject to refund  effective june  related to wpl s request to implement a formula rate structure for its wholesale electric customers 
in february  final written agreements were filed with ferc that contained a settlement between wpl and its wholesale customers  of the issues identified in wpl s filing requesting the formula rate structure 
in august  ferc approved the settlement and the implementation of settlement rates effective june  during the period the interim rate increase was effective from june  to may   wpl over recovered million  including interest  from its wholesale customers 
in september  wpl refunded the million to its wholesale electric customers 
wpl s retail rate case in january  wpl received an order from the pscw approving a net increase in electric and gas retail rates of million effective in january the final increase granted was lower than the increase requested largely due to a decrease in forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs for the test period 
the pscw approval included a regulatory capital structure with equity compared to requested  a return on common equity of compared to requested and lengthened certain regulatory asset amortization periods 
the regulatory capital structure approved by the pscw was determined by adjusting wpl s financial capital structure by approximately million compared to million requested of imputed debt largely from the kewaunee nuclear power plant kewaunee and riverside ppas 
the lower imputed debt adjustment than requested was primarily the result of the pscw denying wpl s request to include the sheboygan falls energy facility sfef lease in the regulatory capital structure calculation 
in addition  as a result of a pscw audit of plant costs  the pscw determined that wpl should have used an after tax afudc rate instead of a pre tax afudc rate 
wpl has made the required entries in to reflect this change and will record afudc at the after tax rate for future retail jurisdiction construction projects 
pursuant to the january order  wpl was allowed recovery of a portion of the previously deferred loss associated with the sale of kewaunee in july and recovery of previously deferred costs associated with the extension of the unplanned outage at kewaunee prior to the sale 
the pscw order included recovery of million of these deferred costs through increased retail electric rates charged by wpl over a two year recovery period ending december the january pscw order also approved modifications to wpl s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism 
beginning in  of all gains and losses from wpl s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism were to be retained by wpl  with the remaining refunded to or recovered from customers 
the january pscw order also directed wpl to work with pscw staff to help the pscw determine if it may be necessary to reevaluate the current benchmarks for wpl s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism or explore a modified one for one pass through of gas costs to retail customers 
in october  the pscw issued an order providing wpl the option to choose to utilize a modified gas performance incentive sharing mechanism or switch to a modified one for one pass through of gas costs to retail customers using benchmarks 
wpl evaluated the alternatives and chose to implement the modified one for one pass through of gas costs  which became effective nov 
 in may  wpl notified the pscw that its actual average fuel related costs for the month of march had fallen below the monthly fuel monitoring range set in wpl s retail rate case and that projected average fuel related costs for could be below the annual monitoring range to an extent that would warrant a decrease in retail electric rates 
wpl s notification also included a request for the pscw to set wpl s retail electric rates subject to refund 
in june  the pscw issued an order approving wpl s request to set retail electric rates subject to refund effective june  in august  wpl received approval from the pscw to refund to its retail electric customers any over recovery of retail fuel related costs during the period june  through dec 
 as of dec 
  wpl estimated the over recovery of retail fuel related costs during this period to be million  including interest 
wpl refunded to its retail electric customers million in and million in as of dec 
  wpl reserved million for the remaining refund amounts  including interest  anticipated to be paid to its retail electric customers in the second quarter of wpl expects to receive the pscw s decision on the remaining refund amount in the first quarter of wpl s fuel related retail rate case in september  the pscw approved a settlement agreement submitted by wpl and intervenors that established final fuel related retail rates at a level reflective of actual fuel costs incurred from july  through june  the approval also allowed previously deferred  incremental purchased power energy costs associated with coal conservation efforts at wpl due to coal delivery disruptions to be included in the actual fuel costs and resolved all issues in the rate case regarding risk management activities and forecasting methodologies 
wpl refunded million to customers in october related to amounts collected in excess of final rates through june as part of the settlement  wpl also agreed to refund any over collection of fuel costs in the second half of in june  the pscw approved a million refund  including interest  to wpl s retail customers related to the over collection of retail fuel related costs during the second half of wpl completed the refund in august planned utility rate cases in ipl expects to file an iowa retail electric rate case in march based on a historical test period 
the key drivers for the filing include recovery of investments in reliability and emissions controls  anticipated increases in electric transmission service expenses and retirement plan costs  known changes in retail electric demand and expenditures associated with the winter storms in and severe flooding in any rate changes are expected to be implemented in two phases with interim rates effective approximately days after the filing and final rates effective approximately nine months later 
wpl expects to file a retail electric and gas rate case in april based on a forward looking test period 
the key drivers for the filing include recovery of investments in reliability and emissions controls  deferred retirement plan costs and changes in retail electric demand forecasts as a result of the economy 
wpl also expects the rate case to address various policy initiatives such as electric and gas decoupling for residential and small commercial customers  expanded energy efficiency initiatives and incentive mechanisms for managing gas commodity costs 
any rate changes granted are expected to be effective in january wpl does not plan to request emergency rate relief for other utility rate case information with the exception of recovering a return on additions to ipl s and wpl s infrastructure  a significant portion of the rate increases included in the above table reflect a reduction in the amortization of deferred credits or the recovery of increased costs incurred or expected to be incurred by ipl and wpl 
thus  increases in revenues from rate increases are not expected to result in a significant increase in net income to either ipl or wpl  as applicable 
authorized return on equity at dec 
  ipl s and wpl s most recently authorized return on common equity for each of its key jurisdictions were as follows authorized authorized return on return on ipl s jurisdictions common equity wpl s jurisdictions common equity iowa retail iub wisconsin retail pscw electric emery generation project electric electric other gas gas wholesale ferc minnesota retail mpuc electric electric gas rate making principles for new electric generating facilities iowa and wisconsin each have laws hf in iowa and act in wisconsin that allow a public utility that proposes to purchase or construct an electric generating facility in its respective state to apply to its state regulatory commission for an order that specifies in advance the rate making principles that the state regulatory commission will apply to certain electric generating facility costs in future rate making proceedings 
both of these laws are designed to give utilities in these states more regulatory certainty  including providing utilities with a fixed rate of return and recovery period for these investments  when financing electric generation projects 
however  the regulatory approval process to build new generation is different between the state jurisdictions as noted below 
ipl and wpl may utilize the rate making principles included in hf and act  respectively  for some of the electric generation facilities included in alliant energy s utility generation plan 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan for additional details of alliant energy s utility generation plan including discussion of the pscw s may decision regarding wpl s application for advance rate making principles for its cedar ridge wind project wpl subsequently did not accept the pscw s decision  the iub s february decision regarding ipl s application for advance rate making principles for its mw whispering willow east wind project and the iub s february decision regarding ipl s application for advance rate making principles for its proposed coal fired generating facility in marshalltown  iowa 
wpl expects to use traditional rate making procedures for the recovery of and return on its capital costs for the mw bent tree wind project 
iowa under hf in iowa  the iub is required to issue  prior to the start of construction  advance rate making principles for certain electric generating facilities located in iowa including new base load primarily defined as nuclear or coal fired generation facilities with a capacity of mw or more  combined cycle natural gas fired facilities of any size and renewable generating resources  such as wind facilities  of any size 
the ratemaking principles proceeding can be filed simultaneously or separately from the utility s application for an iub issued generating facility certificate of public convenience  use and necessity gcu certificate 
a gcu certificate is required for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in iowa with mw or more of capacity 
the iub s advance rate making principles decision will be applied to the facility s construction  unless the utility withdraws its gcu certificate application 
the iub shall issue the advance rate making principles if the iub finds that the requesting utility has an energy efficiency plan in effect and that the utility has demonstrated that the generating facility is reasonable when compared to other feasible alternative sources of supply 
wisconsin under act in wisconsin  a utility seeking to construct an electric generating facility has the option to seek advance rate making treatment for that facility 
a wisconsin utility therefore is not obligated to file for advance rate making principles 
also  under act a utility can proceed with an approved project under traditional rate making if the terms of the pscw order on the advance rate making principles are viewed as unsatisfactory to the utility 
a ca application is required to be filed with the pscw for the construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in wisconsin with a capacity of less than mw or any new electric generating facility located outside of wisconsin 
a cpcn application is required to be filed with the pscw for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in wisconsin with a capacity of mw or more 
in both situations  construction may not commence until the pscw has granted approval based on a finding that the project is in the public interest 
in addition  wpl s ownership and operation of electric generating facilities located outside of wisconsin to serve wisconsin customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the pscw 
afudc new electric generating facilities require large outlays of capital and long periods of time to construct resulting in significant financing costs 
financing costs incurred by utilities during construction are generally included as part of the cwip cost of the new generating facility through afudc rates as approved by the applicable regulatory commission 
in december  the pscw issued its written order for wpl s retail electric rate case which authorizes wpl to record afudc on all cwip balances in excess of the cwip balances used to determine settlement rates in the test year 
general rate making principles provide ipl and wpl the ability to recover afudc as depreciation expense after the asset is placed in service 
preliminary survey and investigation charges and pre construction expenditures new electric generating facilities require material expenditures for planning  siting  engineering studies and other activities  which must be undertaken prior to receiving approval from regulatory commissions to begin construction 
these expenditures commonly called preliminary survey and investigation charges are generally recorded as regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheet for large generating facility projects in accordance with ferc regulations 
in wisconsin  the retail portion of these amounts is expensed immediately  unless otherwise authorized by the pscw 
however  since these amounts are material for wpl s cedar ridge wind project  wpl s proposed nelson dewey generating unit and wpl s clean air compliance program cacp projects  wpl requested and received deferral accounting approval to record the retail portion of these costs as regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in the fourth quarter of  the pscw denied continuation of the nelson dewey generating unit project 
as a result  no material additional costs for this project are expected to be deferred 
in addition to the expenditures noted above  certain projects needing regulatory approval may also require that payments for long lead materials be incurred prior to project approval in order to meet anticipated completion schedules 
these expenditures have been identified as pre construction expenditures by ipl and wpl 
for wpl  the retail portion of pre construction expenditures for the projects described in the previous paragraph has also been approved for deferral as regulatory assets 
all remaining pre construction expenditures for both ipl and wpl are recorded as regulatory assets on their respective consolidated balance sheets 
for ipl  amounts deferred and recorded as preliminary survey and investigation charges do not include any accrual of carrying costs or afudc 
upon regulatory approval of the projects  all such amounts included as preliminary survey and investigation charges are transferred to cwip and begin to accrue afudc 
ipl anticipates that all such amounts deferred as preliminary survey and investigation charges will be fully recovered in future rates charged to customers 
for wpl  the wholesale portion of amounts deferred and recorded as preliminary survey and investigation charges do not include any accrual of carrying costs or afudc 
wpl s retail portion of deferred preliminary survey and investigation charges commonly referred to as pre certification expenditures and pre construction expenditures include accrual of carrying costs as prescribed in the approved deferral order 
upon regulatory approval of the project  the wholesale portion of deferred preliminary survey and investigation charges as well as all pre construction expenditures are transferred to cwip and begin to accrue afudc 
the retail portion of deferred preliminary survey and investigation charges or pre certification expenditures remain as regulatory assets until they are approved for inclusion in revenue requirements and amortized to expense 
wpl believes amounts currently deferred as either preliminary survey and investigation expenditures or pre construction expenditures are probable of recovery from customers through changes in future rates 
wpl is currently recovering through retail rates the amounts for the cedar ridge wind project and a portion of the nelson dewey pre certification expenditures 
remaining deferred amounts for nelson dewey and the cacp projects have not yet been included in rates charged to customers 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan and note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details on these costs 
utility fuel cost recovery ipl s retail and wholesale electric and retail gas tariffs and wpl s wholesale electric and retail gas tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its rates for changes in commodity costs thereby mitigating price risk for prudently incurred commodity costs 
such rate mechanisms significantly reduce commodity price risk associated with ipl s retail and wholesale electric margins  ipl s retail gas margins  wpl s wholesale electric margins and wpl s retail gas margins 
wpl s retail electric margins  however  are more exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs as discussed below 
wpl s retail electric fuel related cost recovery mechanism wpl s retail electric rates are based on forecasts of forward looking test periods and include estimates of future monthly fuel related costs includes fuel and purchased power energy costs anticipated during the test period 
during each electric retail rate proceeding  the pscw sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel related costs used to determine rates in such proceeding 
if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges  the pscw can authorize an adjustment to future retail electric rates 
the fuel monitoring ranges set by the pscw include three different ranges based on monthly costs  cumulative costs and annual costs during the test period 
in order for wpl to be authorized to file for a proceeding to change rates related to fuel related costs during the test period  wpl must demonstrate a that either any actual monthly costs during the test period exceeded the monthly ranges or the actual cumulative costs to date during the test period exceeded the cumulative ranges  and b that the annual projected costs that include cumulative actual costs for the test period also exceed the annual ranges 
wpl  the pscw or any other affected party may initiate a proceeding to change rates due to changes in fuel related costs during the monitoring period based on the above criteria 
in december  the pscw approved an order continuing wpl s fuel cost monitoring ranges of plus or minus for the monthly range  for the cumulative range  plus or minus for the first month  plus or minus for the second month  and plus or minus for the remaining months of the monitoring period  and plus or minus for the annual range 
the pscw attempts to authorize  after a required hearing  interim fuel related rate increases within days of notice to customers 
any such change in rates would be effective prospectively and would require a refund with interest at the authorized return on common equity if final rates are determined to be lower than interim rates approved 
rate decreases due to reductions in fuel related costs can be implemented without a hearing 
the rules also include a process whereby wisconsin utilities can seek deferral treatment of emergency changes in fuel related costs between fuel related or base rate cases 
such deferrals would be subject to review  approval and recovery in future fuel related or base retail rate cases 
potential changes to wpl s electric fuel related cost recovery mechanism in february  wpl and certain other investor owned utilities jointly filed with the pscw proposed changes to the current retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin 
the proposal recommends each utility annually file a forecast of total fuel related costs and sales for the upcoming month period  which will be used to determine fuel related rates for such period 
any under or over collection of actual fuel related costs  in excess of plus or minus  for a utility during such month period would be reflected in an escrow account  with interest for that utility 
the balance of the escrow account at the end of each year would be included in the forecast of total fuel related costs for the following month period allowing recovery of under collected costs or refund of over collected costs in each subsequent year 
the proposal also provides the pscw an opportunity to review the actual fuel related costs for each month period to ensure the fuel related costs were prudent 
the definition of fuel related costs would also be expanded to specifically include midwest independent transmission system operator miso market costs and revenues  emission allowance and trading costs and revenues  renewable resource credit costs and revenues and other variable operation and maintenance costs 
in may  pscw commissioners directed pscw staff to draft proposed new retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin similar to the joint utility proposal filed with the pscw in february the major differences between the joint utility proposal and the current pscw staff draft rules include the pscw staff draft rules include a plus or minus threshold for changes in rate recovery compared to the level included in the joint utility proposal  the pscw staff draft rules propose an annual deferral accounting process instead of the monthly escrow accounting proposed by the joint utilities  and the pscw staff draft rules include an earnings test such that future collection of under collected amounts deferred under these rules may be limited if the individual utility is earning in excess of its authorized return on equity 
in july  pscw commissioners voted to formally proceed with the promulgation of new retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin that were developed by pscw staff in a public hearing and comment period  as well as subsequent legislative committee review  are required before any changes to the current rules could become effective 
more recently the pscw has indicated some desire for statutory changes prior to promulgating revised fuel rules 
alliant energy expects the fuel cost recovery process will be a subject of both legislative and administrative interest in wpl is currently unable to predict the final outcome of this initiative 
recent regulatory related legislative developments greenhouse gas emissions legislative developments midwestern ghg accord ghg accord in november  several midwest state governors including the governors of iowa  minnesota and wisconsin signed the ghg accord to be carried out through the midwest governor s association mga 
under the ghg accord  a working group is discussing implementation of a midwestern ghg reduction program that will establish ghg reduction targets and timeframes consistent with member state targets  develop a market based and multi sector cap and trade program to help achieve ghg reductions  establish a system to enable tracking  management  and crediting for entities that reduce ghg emissions  and develop and implement additional steps as needed to achieve the reduction targets  such as a low carbon fuel standards and regional incentives and funding mechanisms 
a proposed cap and trade agreement and comprehensive set of ghg proposals from the mga will not be available until some time later in further legislative and or regulatory action in each participating state will be necessary to adopt any model rule or to implement other provisions that may be proposed under this ghg accord 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts the ghg accord will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
iowa the iowa general assembly enacted sf in and hf in this legislation charged the iowa climate change advisory council iccac to issue a report including ghg reduction proposals to the governor and the general assembly by jan  iccac issued its final report in december including two ghg reduction scenarios 
one scenario specified by the enabling legislation would achieve ghg emissions reductions of by  by and by  from levels 
the second scenario would achieve ghg emission reductions of by  by and by  from levels 
the final report also recommends policy options for reducing ghg emissions in iowa 
the iowa legislature has received new energy related documents to review and discuss including the iowa utility association study on renewable energy potential  the updated and expanded state energy independence plan and the iccac report 
also  a legislative interim committee on energy efficiency issued a report along with various recommendations in december legislative actions may be required to implement recommendations from these reports 
however  there have been no bills filed at this time 
in addition  such actions may be influenced by the outcomes of the ghg accord 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to determine what impacts these initiatives will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
wisconsin in april  governor doyle signed executive order which created the wisconsin task force on global warming 
in july  the task force issued its final report containing policy recommendations for state action on climate change 
the report contains a series of short and long term goals and action items wisconsin might undertake 
some of these items require legislative action before they can take effect  while others can be implemented by administrative action 
specifically  the final report recommends that wisconsin ghg emissions return to levels no later than  a reduction from levels by and a reduction from levels by the report also includes recommendations for aggressive energy efficiency and conservation policies across the wisconsin economy  recommended exploration of innovative rate design and demand response programs  and calls for the removal of financial disincentives for utilities to promote and invest in conservation and efficiency 
the task force report also recommended increased funding for the wisconsin efficiency program  focus on energy  which is funded by a recoverable percentage of utility gross revenues 
in addition  the wisconsin task force final report recommended that utilities be required to produce of the electricity they generate from renewable energy sources by current state law is approximately by 
these topics continue to be studied by way of various generic dockets which are currently on going 
regarding the cap and trade policy  the task force concluded that a broadly based  multi sector  mandatory federal level cap and trade program is strongly preferred 
however  it also recommended that wisconsin work with the mga to develop a regional cap and trade program 
recommendations from these efforts would likely require legislative action before implementation approaches can be determined 
in addition  state efforts may be influenced by the outcomes of the ghg accord 
alliant energy and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts these initiatives will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
minnesota in may  an energy related law sf was enacted in minnesota 
in conjunction with the renewable energy standards bill sf enacted in february  sf is intended to reduce minnesota s per capita reliance on fossil fuels for energy and reduce emissions that contribute to climate change 
sf authorizes a climate change advisory group to develop a comprehensive ghg reduction action plan to be completed by august this plan was delivered to the minnesota legislature for consideration in february alliant energy expects legislation to be introduced for consideration in the regular session 
sf establishes a statewide goal impacting all sectors  including utilities  to reduce ghg emissions by  by  and at least by  from levels 
sf also includes a provision which would preclude  with certain exceptions  alliant energy from the following during the period from aug 
 until a comprehensive ghg reduction plan is enacted constructing a large energy facility in minnesota that would contribute to ghg emissions  importing or committing to import from outside minnesota power from a large facility contributing to ghg emissions  and entering into a long term ppa of mw or more  or exceeding five years in length  that would increase minnesota ghg emissions 
carbon reduction projects  including reductions of ghg emissions at existing facilities or purchase of carbon allowances  which offset an equal or greater amount emitted by any of these actions  will result in exemptions from this provision 
ppas and large facility projects filed or entered into before apr 
  are currently exempted from this provision of sf however  the minnesota legislature may establish limits for these exempted items in the future 
sf also establishes statewide energy conservation and efficiency goals and creates a provision that utilities may file for cost recovery for renewable facilities they own and operate 
utilities are also exempted from the competitive resource acquisition process competitive bidding when constructing  owning and operating generation used to comply with sf s renewable energy standards 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to determine what impacts sf will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
beginning in february  the minnesota legislature debated whether to mandate expedited action by the state to implement a cap and trade system to help achieve ghg reductions hf 
the bill was amended to only require an economic  environmental and public health impact analysis of the effect a cap and trade system might have on the state and work with the mga in developing recommendations for regional or state cap and trade proposals 
the bill leaves open the possibility that legislation implementing a state only cap and trade system will be debated in  but the mga will not have recommendations useful for the legislative session 
in may  the amended version of hf passed and was signed by the governor  becoming chapter minnesota continues to consider whether to enact a cap and trade system 
alliant energy and ipl are currently unable to determine what impacts hf will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
renewable energy standards legislative developments iowa in  a law iowa acts  chapter  sections governing alternate energy production facilities was enacted in iowa 
this law required the iub to require electric utilities to purchase or wheel electricity from alternate energy or small hydro facilities located in the utilities service area 
ipl has an obligation to purchase a proportionate share of mw of capacity and associated energy from alternate energy and small hydro production facilities 
the law was amended in hf to allow electric utilities to own the alternate energy and small hydro production facilities used for compliance with the requirement 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan generation projects under construction or pending regulatory agency approvals sutherland for discussion of conditions in the sutherland approval by the iub in august that may require certain levels of renewable energy 
wisconsin in march  a law act governing renewable energy was enacted in wisconsin 
act commits wisconsin utilities to a renewable portfolio standard rps using a benchmark of average retail sales of renewable electricity in  and  which was approximately for wpl 
wpl must increase renewable retail electric sales as a percentage of total retail electric sales by two percentage points above this benchmark by and by six percentage points above this benchmark by wisconsin utilities may meet the renewable energy requirements of the rps with renewable energy generated by the utility  renewable energy acquired under ppas or the use of renewable resource credits 
minnesota in february  a law sf governing renewable energy was enacted in minnesota 
sf commits certain utilities operating in minnesota  including ipl  to a renewable energy standard res based on retail electric sales from renewable energy sources as a percentage of total retail electric sales in minnesota 
ipl must meet an res of by  by  by  and by utilities in minnesota may meet the requirements of the res with renewable energy generated by the utility  renewable energy acquired under ppas or the use of renewable resource credits 
refer to strategic overview utility generation plan for discussion of alliant energy s utility generation plan which includes additional supply from wind generation that will contribute towards ipl meeting the res in minnesota and wpl meeting the rps in wisconsin discussed above 
the wind generation proposed by ipl and wpl was selected as an economic source of energy as part of a resource planning process 
each of ipl and wpl will need to add approximately mw of incremental renewable electric supply to their current electric supply portfolio to increase by their respective sales from renewable energy sources as a percentage of their respective total retail electric sales 
income tax legislative developments american recovery and reinvestment bill of in february  the arrb was enacted 
the arrb contains various provisions that are intended to stimulate the economy and provide tax relief to individuals and employers 
the most significant provisions of the arrb for alliant energy  ipl and wpl are related to credits available for wind facilities placed in service by dec

electric risk management plan ermp in october  the pscw issued an order approving an ermp for wpl that expires in december the ermp determines hedging options for wpl s electric operations and which costs of hedging transactions can be included in fuel costs for purposes of cost recovery 
the ermp was developed with the involvement of individuals representing key customer groups as well as pscw staff  and as proposed  included a number of new elements which would expand wpl s hedging options  including longer time horizons and greater protections for decisions made to take advantage of unusual market conditions 
however  in approving the ermp  the pscw added a new limitation that wpl may not hedge more than a cumulative of a future month s expected open position expected electric system demand less expected generation and firm purchases although this limitation may be waived for the month immediately preceding the future month in order to assure reliable provision of service 
alliant energy s results of operations overview executive summary provides an overview of alliant energy s  and earnings and the various components of alliant energy s business 
additional details of alliant energy s  and earnings are discussed below 
utility electric margins electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less electric production fuel and purchased power expenses 
management believes that electric margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues since electric production fuel and purchased power expenses are generally passed through to customers  and therefore  result in changes to electric operating revenues that are comparable to changes in electric production fuel and purchased power expenses 
electric margins and megawatt hour mwh sales for alliant energy were as follows revenues and costs dollars in millions mwhs sold mwhs in thousands a b a b residential commercial industrial retail subtotal sales for resale wholesale bulk power and other other includes wheeling total revenues sales electric production fuel expense purchased power expense energy capacity total electric production fuel and purchased power expense margins a reflects the change from to b reflects the change from to vs 
summary electric margins decreased million  or  in  primarily due to million of lower wheeling revenues at ipl largely due to the sale of its electric transmission assets in december  an million reduction in electric margins from the impact of fuel and purchased power energy cost recoveries at wpl  an estimated million reduction in electric margins during due to the loss of retail sales during electric service outages caused by the severe flooding in ipl s service territory in june  an estimated million reduction in electric margins from changes in the net impacts of weather conditions and alliant energy s weather hedging activities  million of incremental purchased power capacity costs at ipl during the second half of for leasing temporary generation to contribute to the reliability of the electric grid in cedar rapids  iowa as a result of damage to infrastructure caused by the severe flooding in june and lower industrial sales volumes at wpl due to the negative impact the slowing economy in had on wpl s large industrial customer demand during such period 
these items were partially offset by million of purchased power capacity costs at wpl in related to a contract that ended in december  a million impact from changes in annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates during the second quarter  which is discussed below in unbilled revenue estimates  million of lower purchased power capacity costs at wpl in from its kewaunee ppa  the loss of retail sales during electric service outages caused by the winter storms in ipl s service territory in and an increase in weather normalized sales at ipl partially due to increased industrial sales to ethanol production facilities in ipl s service territory 
vs 
summary electric margins increased million  or  in  primarily due to an increase in weather normalized retail sales volumes  the net impacts of weather conditions and alliant energy s weather hedging activities  and the impact of wpl s retail base rate increase  which began in january these increases were partially offset by the impact of annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates during the second quarter  million of higher purchased power capacity costs related to the duane arnold energy center daec ppa  the impact of ipl s and wpl s sales of their electric distribution properties in illinois in february and the loss of retail sales at ipl during the power outages caused by winter storms in the increase in weather normalized retail sales volumes was largely due to the negative impact high electric prices and other economic conditions during had on customer usage during that period and impacts of ethanol industry growth in alliant energy s service territory 
the impact of wpl s retail base rate increase resulted in retail fuel related rates exceeding retail fuel related costs during the increase in purchased power capacity costs was largely due to one additional month of capacity costs related to the daec ppa in compared to because the daec ppa did not begin until the sale of ipl s interest in the daec was completed in late january fuel and purchased power energy fuel related cost recoveries alliant energy s electric production fuel and purchased power energy expense increased million  or  and decreased million  or  in and  respectively  primarily due to changes in commodity prices 
the decrease in was also due to pscw approval for wpl to record million of previously deferred costs associated with coal conservation efforts due to the coal delivery disruptions in electric production fuel and purchased power expense in fuel related commodity prices in were higher than and as well as historic averages largely due to impacts from natural gas disruption caused by hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of due to ipl s rate recovery mechanisms for fuel related costs  changes in fuel related costs resulted in comparable changes in electric revenues and  therefore  did not have a significant impact on ipl s electric margins 
wpl s rate recovery mechanism for wholesale fuel related costs also provides for subsequent adjustments to its wholesale electric rates for changes in commodity costs  thereby mitigating impacts of changes to commodity costs on its electric margins 
wpl s retail fuel related costs incurred in both and were lower than the forecasted fuel related costs used to set retail rates during such periods 
wpl estimates the lower than forecasted retail fuel related costs increased electric margins by approximately million and million in and  respectively 
wpl s recovery of fuel related costs during did not have a significant impact on its electric margins 
the and increases in electric margins relate to fuel related fuel cost recoveries during january through march and january through may  respectively 
in accordance with orders received from the pscw  wpl established reserves for rate refund of million in and million in for the estimated refunds related to the over recovery of retail fuel related costs during the months of april through december and june through december  respectively 
wpl refunded approximately million of these rate refunds to its retail electric customers in and million in refer to other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions commodity price risk for discussion of risks associated with increased fuel and purchased power energy costs on wpl s electric margins

impacts of weather conditions excluding the impacts of severe flooding and winter storms in ipl s service territory estimated increases decreases to alliant energy s electric margins from the net impacts of weather and alliant energy s weather hedging activities were as follows in millions weather impacts on demand compared to normal weather gains losses from weather derivatives a net weather impact a recorded in other revenues in the above table 
alliant energy s electric sales demand is seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning usage by its residential and commercial customers 
cooling degree days cdd data is used to measure the variability of temperatures during summer months and is correlated with electric sales demand 
heating degree days hdd data is used to measure the variability of temperatures during winter months and is correlated with electric and gas sales demand 
refer to utility gas margins impacts of weather conditions for details regarding hdd in alliant energy s service territory 
cdd in alliant energy s service territories were as follows actual cdd a normal a cedar rapids  iowa ipl madison  wisconsin wpl a cdd are calculated using a simple average of the high and low temperatures each day compared to a degree base 
normal degree days are calculated using a rolling year average of historical cdd 
alliant energy typically utilizes weather derivatives based on cdd and hdd to reduce the potential volatility on its margins during the summer months of june through august and the winter months of november through march  respectively 
alliant energy entered into weather derivatives based on cdd in cedar rapids  iowa and madison  wisconsin for the periods june  to aug 
 and june  to aug 
 and weather derivatives based on cdd in chicago  illinois for the period june  to aug 
 alliant energy entered into weather derivatives based on hdd in cedar rapids  iowa and madison  wisconsin for the periods nov 
 to march  and nov 
 to march  and weather derivatives based on hdd in chicago  illinois for the periods nov 
 to march  the weather derivatives utilized for june  to aug 
 did not produce the results expected by alliant energy 
while cdd had historically been highly correlated between chicago  illinois and alliant energy s service territories  this was not the case in as cdd were above normal in chicago  illinois during june to aug 
 compared to below normal in cedar rapids  iowa 
alliant energy estimated this lack of correlation resulted in it incurring losses from the weather derivatives that exceeded by approximately million the positive impact on its demand from the warmer than normal weather conditions during june  to aug 
 in addition  alliant energy estimated the impact on demand compared to normal weather during september  and such months were not covered by weather derivatives was million all at ipl  million million at ipl and million at wpl and million million at ipl and million at wpl  respectively 
purchased power capacity costs alliant energy enters into ppas to help meet the electricity demand of its customers 
certain of these ppas include minimum payments for ipl s and wpl s rights to electric generating capacity 
details of purchased power capacity costs included in the electric margin table above were as follows in millions daec ppa ipl kewaunee ppa wpl riverside ppa wpl rockgen ppa wpl flood related ppa ipl summer of only minnesota power ppa wpl expired december other total at dec

adjustments resulting from these refined estimates can increase eg and or decrease eg electric margins reported in the second quarter 
estimated increases decreases in alliant energy s electric margins from the annual adjustments to unbilled revenue estimates recorded in the second quarter were as follows in millions ipl wpl alliant energy sales trends retail sales volumes in were impacted by temporary disruptions of electric service associated with severe weather in june at the peak of the disruptions caused by the severe weather  approximately  electric customers of ipl were unable to receive service 
the most significant impacts of these disruptions on electric sales related to several large industrial customers in cedar rapids  iowa who were unable to receive service after the flood 
as of dec 
  ipl had restored service to all customers in its service territory except approximately  customers that are still not capable of receiving service as a result of damage to their properties caused by the flood 
wholesale and retail sales volumes in and were impacted by ipl s and wpl s sales of their respective electric distribution properties in illinois in february prior to these asset sales  electric revenues and mwhs sold to retail customers in illinois were included in residential  commercial and industrial sales in the electric margin table above 
upon completion of these asset sales  ipl and wpl entered into separate wholesale agreements to continue to provide electric service to their former retail customers in illinois 
electric revenues and mwhs sold under these wholesale agreements are included in wholesale sales in the electric margin table above 
the lower pricing for wholesale customers as compared to retail customers resulted in a decrease to electric margins following the sale of the electric distribution properties in illinois 
bulk power and other revenue changes were largely due to changes in revenues from sales in the wholesale energy market operated by miso 
these changes are impacted by several factors including the availability of alliant energy s generating facilities and electricity demand within miso 
changes in bulk power and other sales revenues were largely offset by changes in electric production fuel and purchased power expense and therefore did not have a significant impact on electric margins

performance based gas commodity recovery program during  wpl had a gas performance incentive which included a sharing mechanism whereby of gains and losses relative to current commodity prices  as well as other benchmarks  were retained by wpl  with the remainder refunded or recovered from customers 
starting in  the program was modified such that of all gains and losses from wpl s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism were retained by wpl  with refunded to or recovered from customers 
effective nov 
  wpl s gas performance incentive sharing mechanism was terminated and replaced with a modified one for one pass through of gas costs 
wpl s performance based gas commodity recovery program resulted in gains which increased gas margins by million and million in and  respectively 
refer to note h of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details of the gas commodity recovery program implemented in the fourth quarter of sales trends transportation other sales volumes were higher in and as compared to largely due to the impact of ipl s and wpl s sales of their respective gas distribution properties in illinois in february prior to these asset sales  gas revenues and dths sold to retail customers in illinois were included in residential  commercial and industrial sales in the gas margin table above

liquidity and capital resources overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe they have  and expect to maintain  an adequate liquidity position to operate their businesses as a result of available capacity under their revolving credit facilities  operating cash flows from their utility business  and available cash and cash equivalents 
based on their liquidity positions and capital structures  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe they will be able to secure the additional capital required to implement their strategic plans and to meet their long term contractual obligations 
access by alliant energy  ipl and wpl to capital markets to fund their future capital requirements is largely dependent on their credit quality and on developments in those capital markets 
liquidity position at dec 
  alliant energy and its subsidiaries had million of cash and cash equivalents and million million at ipl  million at wpl and million at the parent company of available capacity under their revolving credit facilities 
refer to cash flows financing activities short term debt for further discussion of the credit facilities 
refer to note d of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on alliant energy s cash and cash equivalents 
capital structure alliant energy  ipl and wpl plan to maintain consolidated debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade credit ratings to facilitate access to capital markets on reasonable terms and conditions 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s capital structures at dec 
 were as follows dollars in millions alliant energy consolidated ipl wpl common equity preferred equity long term debt incl 
current maturities short term debt in addition to capital structures  other important financial considerations used to determine the characteristics of future financings include financial coverage ratios  flexibility for the utility generation plan  state regulations and the levels of debt imputed by rating agencies 
the most significant debt imputations include a portion of the daec  kewaunee  riverside and rockgen ppas  and the amount of ipl s accounts receivable sold 
refer to rates and regulatory matters utility rate cases wpl s retail rate case for details of imputed debt adjustments approved by the pscw in wpl s retail rate case  which was not changed in the recent stipulated agreement approved by the pscw in december alliant energy  ipl and wpl intend to manage their respective capital structures in such a way that they do not compromise their ability to raise the necessary funding required to enable them to continue to provide utility services reliably and at reasonable costs 
key considerations include maintaining access to the financial markets on the terms  in the amounts and within the timeframes required to fund alliant energy s strategic plan  retaining a prudent level of financial flexibility and maintaining ipl s and wpl s investment grade credit ratings 
the capital structure is only one of a number of components that needs to be actively managed in order to achieve these objectives 
both ipl and wpl currently expect to maintain a capital structure in which total debt would not exceed to  and preferred stock would not exceed to  of total capital 
these targets may be adjusted depending on subsequent developments and their potential impact on ipl s and wpl s investment grade credit ratings 
credit and capital market developments financial markets have come under considerable strain over the past year  resulting in adverse impacts on the availability and terms of credit for businesses 
a number of initiatives are underway by the us treasury department and the federal reserve system intended to contain the contraction of credit in the economy and of liquidity in the various capital markets 
however  financial market conditions remain highly sensitive to the evolving economic outlook 
liquidity in the various markets has fluctuated unpredictably  as investment flows into the safety of us treasury obligations have led to historically low yields in shorter dated treasury bills  inducing funds to be re invested in higher yielding instruments and or longer dated instruments at the beginning of alliant energy  ipl and wpl are aware of the potential implications these credit and capital market developments might have on their ability to raise the external funding required for their respective operations and capital expenditure plans 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl had already taken measures over the past several years to improve their financial strength including reducing debt  securing multi year committed revolving credit facilities to provide backstop liquidity to their commercial paper programs and a committed source of alternative liquidity in the event the commercial paper market becomes disrupted  arranging an accounts receivable sales program for up to million at ipl as an alternative source of working capital financing  retaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund a portion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s current operating and capital requirements in the event of credit market disruptions  extending ipl s and wpl s respective long term debt maturity profiles and avoiding undue concentrations of maturities over the next few years  and converting certain of ipl s and wpl s pollution control revenue bonds from variable interest rates to fixed interest rates 
as discussed below  ipl and wpl retain flexibility in undertaking their capital expenditure programs  particularly with respect to capital expenditures to fund the infrastructure investment programs within their strategic plans 
primary sources and uses of cash alliant energy s most significant source of cash is electric and gas sales to its utility customers 
cash from these sales reimburses ipl and wpl for prudently incurred expenses to provide service to their utility customers and provides ipl and wpl a return on rate base assets required to provide such services 
utility operating cash flows are expected to cover the majority of ipl s and wpl s capital expenditures required to maintain its current infrastructure and dividends paid to alliant energy s shareowners 
capital requirements needed to retire debt and fund capital expenditures for utility rate base growth related to new generating facilities and environmental compliance programs  are expected to be financed primarily through external financings 
ongoing monitoring of credit and capital market conditions allows management to monitor the availability of funding and the terms and conditions attached to such financing 
in order to maintain debt to total capitalization ratios that are consistent with investment grade ratings  alliant energy  ipl and wpl may periodically fund such capital requirements with additional debt and equity

the equity component excludes accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s credit facility agreements each contain negative pledge provisions  which generally prohibit placing liens on any of the property of alliant energy or its subsidiaries with certain exceptions 
exceptions include among others  securing obligations of up to of the consolidated assets of the borrower  non recourse project financing and purchase money liens 
the credit facility agreements each contain provisions that require  during their term  any proceeds from asset sales  with certain exclusions  in excess of of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s respective consolidated assets to be used to reduce commitments under their respective facilities 
exclusions include  among others  certain sale and lease back transactions  and transmission and non regulated assets 
the credit facility agreements each contain customary events of default 
in addition  alliant energy s credit facility agreement contains a cross default provision that is triggered if a domestic majority owned subsidiary of alliant energy incurs an event of default on debt totaling million or more 
if an event of default under any of the credit facility agreements occurs and is continuing  the lenders may declare any outstanding obligations under the credit facility agreements immediately due and payable and could terminate such agreements 
in addition  if any order for relief is entered under bankruptcy laws with respect to alliant energy  ipl or wpl  then any outstanding obligations under the respective credit facility agreements would be immediately due and payable

  alliant energy and resources received a notice of default  dated sep 
  from us bank national association as successor indenture trustee trustee pursuant to which the trustee asserted that resources was in default under the indenture with respect to the exchangeable senior notes due notes  which were issued by resources and were guaranteed by alliant energy 
the alleged default relates to a provision of the indenture that provides that if resources transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to a third party  then the transferee must assume resources obligations under the notes and indenture 
the trustee also filed a compliant seeking a declaratory judgment that resources is in breach of the indenture 
alliant energy and resources do not believe that resources has transferred substantially all of its assets or that a default has occurred under the indenture 
in addition  alliant energy and resources believe that  under the terms of the indenture  even if a default had occurred under the indenture  such default would not have continued after alliant energy and resources executed a fifth supplemental indenture to the indenture on nov 
 pursuant to which the alliant energy parent company assumed the obligations of resources under the indenture and the notes 
alliant energy and resources intend to vigorously defend against this litigation 
if alliant energy s and resources interpretation of the indenture is determined to be incorrect  a default may have occurred under the indenture 
if such default is continuing days after the date the notice of default was received by resources  an event of default will have occurred under the indenture 
the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture would permit the trustee or holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes to declare the principal amount of all outstanding notes  plus accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable by alliant energy 
the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding under the indenture is million 
if a court determined alliant energy s and resources interpretation of the indenture to be incorrect and the trustee or the holders of the notes declared the principal amount of all the outstanding notes to be immediately due and payable by alliant energy  then alliant energy would be required to pay the aggregate principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest  and record a pre tax loss of approximately million based on the amount of unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt expense on alliant energy s consolidated balance sheet at dec 
 in addition  an event of default under the indenture would also trigger cross default provisions in alliant energy s credit facility agreement and ipl s sale of accounts receivable program agreement that could result in the termination of such agreements 
alliant energy and ipl have obtained waivers from the necessary parties to prevent an event of default from occurring through march  under the credit facility agreement and sale of accounts receivable program agreement  respectively

however  alliant energy and its subsidiaries are parties to various agreements  including ppas  fuel contracts and corporate guarantees that are dependent on maintaining investment grade credit ratings 
in the event of a downgrade below investment grade level  alliant energy or its subsidiaries may need to provide credit support  such as letters of credit or cash collateral equal to the amount of the exposure  or may need to unwind the contract or pay the underlying obligation 
in the event of a downgrade below investment grade level  management believes alliant energy  ipl and wpl have sufficient liquidity to cover counterparty credit support or collateral requirements under the various agreements with ratings triggers

environmental overview alliant energy  ipl and wpl are subject to regulation of environmental matters by various federal  state and local authorities as a result of their current and past operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl address these environmental matters with pollution abatement programs  which are subject to continuing review and are periodically revised due to various factors  including changes in environmental regulations  construction plans and compliance costs 
given the dynamic nature of environmental regulations and other related regulatory requirements  ipl and wpl have established an integrated planning process that is used for environmental compliance of their future anticipated operations 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate future expenditures for environmental compliance will be material and will require significant capital investments 
alliant energy anticipates that prudent expenditures incurred by ipl and wpl to comply with environmental requirements likely would be recovered in rates from its customers 
refer to strategic overview multi emission compliance plan for details of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s multi emission compliance plans  including estimated capital expenditures 
the following are major environmental matters that could potentially have a significant impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
air quality the clean air act caa and its amendments mandate preservation of air quality through existing regulations and periodic reviews to ensure adequacy of these provisions based on scientific data 
as part of the basic framework under the caa  the epa is required to establish national ambient air quality standards naaqs  which serve to protect public health and welfare 
these standards address six criteria pollutants  four of which are particularly relevant to alliant energy s electric utility operations  including nox  so  particulate matter pm  and ozone 
ozone is not directly emitted from alliant energy s generating facilities  however  nox emissions may contribute to its formation in the atmosphere 
state implementation plans sips document the collection of regulations that individual state agencies will apply to maintain naaqs and related caa requirements 
the epa must approve each sip and if a sip is not acceptable to the epa or if a state chooses not to issue separate state rules  then the epa can assume enforcement of the caa in that state by issuing a federal implementation plan fip 
areas that comply with naaqs are considered to be in attainment  whereas routinely monitored locations that do not comply with these standards may be classified by the epa as non attainment and require further actions to reduce emissions 
additional emissions standards may also be applied under the caa regulatory framework beyond the naaqs 
the specific federal and state regulations that may affect alliant energy s operations include clear air interstate rule  clean air visibility rule  clean air mercury rule  wisconsin reasonably available control technology rule  wisconsin state mercury rule  ozone national ambient air quality standards rule  fine particle national ambient air quality standards rule and industrial boiler and process heater case by case maximum achievable control technology standards rule 
alliant energy also monitors various other potential environmental matters related to air quality  including litigation of various federal rules issued under the caa statutory authority  revisions to the new source review prevention of significant deterioration permitting programs and new source performance standards  and proposed legislation or other regulatory actions to regulate the emission of ghg 
clean air interstate rule cair was issued by the epa in to reduce emissions of so and nox from electric generating units with greater than mw of capacity 
cair established new so and nox both annual and ozone season emission caps beginning in and  respectively  with further reductions in so and nox emission caps effective in cair included a national cap and trade system  where compliance may be achieved by either adding air pollution controls and or purchasing emission allowances 
in july  the us court of appeals for the dc circuit dc circuit court vacated cair in its entirety 
in september  the epa and other affected parties filed petitions requesting the dc circuit court review this decision  including a request that cair be remanded to the epa for reconsideration and not vacated in its entirety 
in october  the dc circuit court requested the petitioners to file briefs as to whether any party is seeking vacatur of cair and whether the dc circuit court should stay its mandate until the epa promulgates a revised rule 
in december  the dc circuit court issued an order that denied rehearing of the original court decision and also remanded rather than vacated cair to the epa for revision to address flaws identified in the july opinion in the case 
the impact of the court s remand of cair to the epa is that cair obligations became effective january  and require epa issuance of nox emission allowances to regulated sources in the first quarter of in addition  the epa must undertake additional rule making to revise cair in accordance with the remand 
the court ruling in july did not impact other air quality regulations of the epa which currently remain in effect including the acid rain program regulations  which utilize a cap and trade program to reduce so emissions 
the ruling also does not impact the regulatory requirements for reasonable available control technology to reduce nox emissions imposed in the wisconsin counties that are currently non attainment areas under the national ambient air quality standard for ozone 
the court ruling may have an indirect impact on the clean air visibility rule cavr issued by the epa in and related best available retrofit technology rule bart determination guidance in to address regional haze as discussed below 
the epa s response to this court decision and associated implications to ipl and wpl are uncertain at this time 
there are also uncertainties regarding the applicability of state regulations in iowa and wisconsin that were adopted to implement cair and state responses in the interim until the uncertainties are resolved 
in january  epa also took initial action to address one of the cair flaws in this matter related to the inclusion of minnesota in the cair program 
at issue were claims that epa had included minnesota in the cair region based on inaccurate data and that use of better data would result in minnesota falling below the threshold impact level 
consistent with the court ruling  the epa administrator signed the notice for the proposed rule to stay cair fip requirements for minnesota  until such time that the epa determines that minnesota should be included in the eastern cair region 
however  the proposed stay of the cair fip requires notice and comment rulemaking proceedings in the federal register prior to final promulgation 
in addition  this action does not have any effect on epa acid rain program regulations  which currently remain in effect in minnesota 
ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of the court ruling  but expect that capital investments and or modifications resulting from the reconsidered air quality rules that address so and nox emissions could be significant 
until cair is resolved through further action by the epa  alliant energy  ipl and wpl plan to continue to implement their current multi emissions compliance plans  which include investments in air pollution controls for electric generating facilities as well as purchases of emission allowances 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl will closely monitor the future developments of these regulations and update their multi emissions compliance plans as needed 
clean air visibility rule cavr requires states to develop and implement sips to address visibility impairment in designated national parks and wilderness areas across the country with a national goal of no impairment by affected states including iowa  wisconsin and minnesota were required to submit a cavr sip to the epa by december to include bart air pollution controls and other additional measures needed for reducing state contributions to regional haze 
iowa submitted its regional haze sip for epa review and approval in march minnesota and wisconsin have not yet submitted a cavr sip for epa review 
in january  the epa found both minnesota and wisconsin to be deficient regarding the cavr sip submittal 
epa is now required to promulgate a fip within two years 
however  the fip requirement is void if a state submits a regional haze sip  and epa approves that sip within the two year period 
electric generating facility emissions of primary concern for bart and regional haze regulation include so  nox and pm 
there are pending obligations under the epa s cavr to complete bart determinations that would evaluate control options to reduce these emissions at certain wpl and ipl units that were in existence on aug 
 and began operation after aug 
 the dc circuit court cair ruling in may have an indirect impact on the cavr and bart sip implementation approach because the epa allowed for bart obligations for so and nox emissions to be fulfilled by the cair program and this compliance approach was adopted by both iowa and wisconsin 
ipl electric generating facilities operated in minnesota do not combust coal  therefore additional emissions controls were deemed unnecessary in the proposed minnesota cavr sip 
as a result of the dc circuit court cair ruling in december to revise cair  there are uncertainties in the applicability of and compliance outcomes of bart control approaches that will be approved for inclusion in wisconsin and iowa cavr sips 
in addition  there are uncertainties whether additional emissions reductions could be required to address regional haze impacts beyond bart 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are unable to predict the impact that cavr might have on the operations of their existing coal fired generating facilities until iowa and wisconsin have received final epa approvals of cavr sip submittals  which is currently expected in clean air mercury rule camr camr was issued by the epa in to reduce mercury emissions from existing and new us coal fired electric generating units with greater than mw of capacity in a two phased approach 
the first phase of compliance was required by jan 
 and the second phase by jan 
 similar to the cair program  camr would use a national cap and trade system  where compliance may be achieved by either adding mercury pollution controls and or purchasing emission allowances 
in march  the dc circuit court vacated the federal camr rule 
in october  the epa petitioned the us supreme court to review the dc circuit court s decision 
in february  the epa notified the court that it is no longer seeking review of the camr vacatur decision and the supreme court subsequently denied a remaining petitioner s request to reconsider the lower court ruling in this case 
the epa will now propose new federal mercury regulations for coal fired electric generating units 
the epa s federal mercury rules and associated implications to ipl and wpl are uncertain at this time 
in february  the iowa environmental protection commission epc directed the iowa dnr to start the rulemaking process to officially remove the iowa provisions that would implement the epa s vacated federal camr program from the iowa administrative code 
the iowa epc also directed the iowa dnr to incorporate provisions for new mercury monitoring coal sampling or stack testing at iowa units that would have been subject to camr 
alliant energy currently anticipates that related iowa rulemaking will be finalized later in wisconsin proposed rules to implement the federal camr but these rules were never finalized as a result of the vacatur of camr 
the wisconsin dnr has subsequently issued a revised state only mercury rule that is discussed in wisconsin state mercury rule below 
ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final outcome of federal mercury emission regulations  but expect that capital investments and or modifications resulting from mercury emission regulations could be significant 
wisconsin reasonably available control technology ract rule in  the epa designated counties in southeastern wisconsin as non attainment areas for the ozone naaqs 
this designation includes sheboygan county  where wpl operates sfef and the edgewater generating station edgewater 
in  the wisconsin dnr approved the ract rule for nox as part of the federal ozone sip submittal to address non attainment areas in wisconsin 
facility modifications are not necessary at sfef to comply with this rule 
as part of its air emissions compliance plan  wpl has invested in installation of low nox combustion control technologies and will continue to evaluate its compliance approach to meet the and compliance deadlines for nox emissions reductions at edgewater 
however  final compliance requirements cannot be certain until final epa approval of the ract rule has been received  which is currently expected in refer to strategic overview multi emission compliance plan air pollution control projects submitted for pscw approval for discussion of proposed air pollution controls for nox emission reductions at edgewater 
wisconsin state mercury rule in  the wisconsin dnr independently issued a state only mercury emission control rule that affects electric utility companies in wisconsin 
the rule explicitly recognizes an underlying state statutory restriction that state regulations cannot be more stringent than those included in any federal mercury program unless there is a demonstration that more stringent requirements are necessary to provide adequate protection for public health or welfare 
the rule states that the wisconsin dnr must adopt state rule changes within months of publication of any federal rules 
in march  the wisconsin dnr issued a mercury public health and welfare finding and related notice of proposed revisions to wisconsin s current state mercury rule 
the current and revised rules apply to coal fired generating units with greater than mw of capacity 
under the revised rule  wpl must reduce mercury emissions by by jan 
 from a baseline established in the current state mercury rule 
in addition  large coal fired electric generating units with greater than mw of capacity must either achieve a mercury emissions reduction standard by jan 
 or choose a multi pollutant alternative that requires the affected facilities to achieve nox and so reductions beyond those currently required by federal and state regulations 
if the multi pollutant approach is elected  an additional six years is allowed to achieve the mercury emission reduction standard for the affected facilities 
other coal fired electric generating units between mw and mw of capacity must install best available control technology by jan 
 to reduce mercury emissions 
the wisconsin mercury rule revisions were adopted by the natural resources board in june  approved by the wisconsin legislature in october and became effective in december wpl continues to evaluate the impact of these rule revisions and believes its current multi emissions compliance plan includes sufficient controls to achieve compliance 
ozone naaqs rule in march  the epa announced reductions in the primary naaqs for hour ozone to a level of parts per million ppm from the previous standard of ppm 
the epa s final designations of non attainment areas for this new ozone standard are to be issued in with sips required in alliant energy is currently unable to predict the potential impact of this new ozone standard on its operations 
depending on the level and location of non attainment areas  alliant energy  ipl and wpl may be subject to additional nox emissions reduction requirements to meet the new ozone standard 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to monitor regulatory developments related to the new ozone standard issuance and the associated uncertainties to their current multi emissions compliance plans 
fine particle naaqs rule the epa lowered the hour fine particle primary naaqs pm naaqs from micrograms per cubic meter ug m to ug m in in december  the epa issued its decision on non attainment areas designated as not achieving the pm naaqs 
the non attainment areas for wisconsin include the location of wpl s columbia energy center 
no non attainment areas were designated for minnesota and ipl does not have any electric generating facilities located in those areas designated non attainment in iowa 
the epa s designation of areas in non attainment of the new pm standard is based on the three most recent years of air monitoring data through 
the epa s official designations remain pending until publication in the federal register 
in february  wisconsin dnr submitted complete  quality assured  and certified monitoring data for  which may be used with two previous years of data and to have an area changed back to attainment status provided the three years of data show the area is now in compliance with the standard 
wisconsin dnr concluded that the through data supports a designation of attainment for some areas including the location of the columbia energy center  however  final status requires epa approval 
the effective date of final designations will be days after publication in the federal register 
therefore  the anticipated future timeline for action is as follows the epa publishes final pm designations in the federal register  which will take effect within days of publication  sips filed with the epa that demonstrate actions to be taken to achieve attainment are due three years from the effective date of the designations  and attainment deadline to meet the pm naaqs required five years from effective date of designations 
in february  the dc circuit court of appeals issued a decision for litigation regarding the epa s determination not to lower the annual pm naaqs in in response to the litigation decision  the epa must re evaluate its justification for not tightening the annual standard related to adverse effects on health and visibility 
alliant energy is currently unable to predict the potential impact of the pm naaqs on its operations  but ipl or wpl may be subject to additional emission reduction requirements including so  nox and pm 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to monitor regulatory developments related to the pm naaqs and the associated uncertainties to their current multi emissions compliance plans 
industrial boiler and process heater case by case maximum achievable control technology mact rule in  the epa s industrial boiler and process heater case by case mact rule became effective  and compliance with these new emission requirements for hazardous air pollutants was required by september this rule applies to fossil fuel electric generating units with less than mw capacity as well as certain auxiliary boilers and process heaters operated at electric generating facilities 
in  alliant energy submitted initial notifications to the epa and iowa dnr identifying specific units that may require compliance with the industrial boiler and process heater case by case mact rule and subsequently received concurrence that two of ipl s coal fired electric generating units were subject to the rule s emissions control and compliance requirements 
in june  a court decision vacated this rule 
epa will be revising the industrial boiler and process heater case by case mact rule in response to this court decision and the implications to ipl and wpl are uncertain at this time 
until the epa issues a revised industrial boiler and process heater case by case mact rule  the federal caa generally requires affected facilities to submit a permit application for a case by case mact determination to state permitting authorities for all potentially affected units under this rule 
case by case mact determinations are effective compliance measures until revised final federal regulations can replace these interim requirements 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl anticipate submittal of case by case permit applications in the first quarter of the outcome of the case by case mact determinations by the iowa dnr and wisconsin dnr are uncertain at this time 
third party excess emission claims alliant energy  ipl and wpl are aware that certain citizen groups have begun pursuing claims against owners of utility generating facilities regarding excess emissions  including opacity emissions 
in addition  wpl is aware that certain public comments have been submitted to the wisconsin dnr regarding excess emission reports for wpl s generating facilities 
wpl is unable to predict what actions  if any  the wisconsin dnr or the public commenters may take in response to these public comments 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to monitor their emissions closely to determine whether additional controls will be required 
the anticipated additional capital investments for compliance with air quality rules discussed in strategic overview multi emission compliance plan are expected to contribute to improvements in opacity emissions 
wpl has received several renewed air operating permits for its generating facilities and will continue to evaluate the timing of investments and control equipment options to comply with any new permit requirements 
third party alleged air permitting violation claims citizen groups have pursued claims against utilities and permitting agencies for alleged air permitting violations 
ipl and wpl are aware of certain public comments or petitions from citizen groups that have been submitted to the iowa dnr and wisconsin dnr  respectively  regarding the renewal of air operating permits at certain of their facilities 
wpl has since received renewal air permits for two facilities that contain changes to permit conditions that resulted from the wisconsin dnr s review of the comments or petitions 
in december  a citizen group submitted a notice of intent to sue the epa for failure to respond to its petition encouraging epa to challenge one of these permits 
ipl and wpl are unable to predict what actions  if any  the wisconsin dnr  iowa dnr  or the public commenters may take in response to any public comments  petitions for existing permits or draft renewal permits 
in december  wpl received the epa region v s request under section of the caa for certain information relating to the historical operation of wpl s columbia  edgewater and nelson dewey coal fired generating units in wisconsin 
wpl is in the process of responding to this data request 
wpl cannot presently predict the impact of the epa s request on its financial condition or results on operations 
ghg emissions climate change continues to garner public attention along with support for policymakers to take action to mitigate global warming 
there is considerable debate regarding the public policy response that the us should adopt  involving both domestic actions and international efforts 
several members of congress have proposed legislation to regulate ghg emissions  primarily targeting reductions of carbon dioxide co emissions 
in addition  efforts are underway by the epa to respond to a court ruling that could require rules to reduce ghg emissions  including assessment of whether or how the agency should regulate ghg emissions 
state and regional initiatives to address ghg emissions are also underway in the states covering alliant energy s utility service territory 
specifically  governors from nine midwest states  including iowa  wisconsin and minnesota  signed the midwestern ghg accord in november the participants were expected to develop a proposed cap and trade agreement and a model rule within months of the date of this accord 
however  the midwestern ghg accord recently released a revised timeline indicating a proposed cap and trade agreement and model rule will not be available until mid the accord also provides for an month implementation period following completion of the cap and trade agreement and model rule 
refer to rates and regulatory matters recent regulatory related legislative developments for state initiatives to address ghg emissions 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl continue to take voluntary measures to reduce their emissions including co and other ghg as prudent steps to address potential climate change regulation 
in the third quarter of  alliant energy completed the formal application process and third party audit for participation in the phase i period of the chicago climate exchange ccx 
ccx is a voluntary market based emissions cap and trade program for reducing ghg emissions including co strategically  alliant energy  ipl and wpl focus on the following areas to reduce ghg installation of commercially proven controls for air emissions and continued operational excellence to achieve further generating facility efficiency improvements  demand side management including energy conservation programs  expansion of company owned renewable energy sources  continued use of ppas and investments that focus on lower or non emitting generation resources  and development of technology solutions through funding of collaborative research programs for advanced clean coal generation as well as potential options for carbon sequestration 
refer to strategic overview multi emission compliance plan for information regarding ipl s proposed plan to reduce ghg emissions announced in alliant energy s board of directors has assigned oversight of environmental policy and planning issues  including climate change  to the environmental  nuclear  health and safety enhs committee 
the enhs committee is comprised solely of independent directors 
the enhs committee reports on its reviews and  as appropriate  makes recommendations to alliant energy s board of directors 
given the highly uncertain outcome and timing of future regulations regarding the control of ghg emissions  alliant energy  ipl and wpl currently cannot predict the financial impact of any future climate change regulations on their operations but the capital expenditures to comply with any new emissions controls could be significant 
water quality federal clean water act the federal clean water act requires the epa to regulate cooling water intake structures to assure that these structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts to fish and other aquatic life 
in  the second phase of this epa rule became effective and is generally referred to as section b of the clean water act b 
b applies to existing cooling water intake structures at large steam electric generating facilities 
ipl and wpl have identified seven and three generating facilities  respectively  which are believed to be impacted by b 
in january  a court opinion invalidated aspects of the b rule that allowed for consideration of cost effectiveness when determining the appropriate compliance measures 
in july  the epa formally suspended the phase ii b rule 
in december  the us supreme court heard arguments on whether the epa may compare costs to benefits when setting technology based requirements to minimize environmental impacts at cooling water intake structures 
a decision in this case is anticipated in the first half of ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the final requirements  but expect that capital investments and or modifications resulting from the regulation could be significant 
proposed wisconsin state thermal rule in february  wpl submitted comments to the wisconsin dnr on the proposed rule regarding the amount of heat that wpl s generating facilities can discharge into wisconsin waters 
the wisconsin dnr has reviewed all comments and is completing its revision of the proposed rule 
a final rule may be approved by the wisconsin natural resources board as early as the first half of at this time  wpl is unable to predict the final outcome of the proposed rule  but believes that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from this rule could be significant 
hydroelectric fish passages and fish protective devices in  ferc issued an order requiring wpl to take the following actions regarding one of wpl s hydroelectric generating facilities develop a detailed engineering and biological evaluation of potential fish passages for the facility  install an agency approved fish protective device at the facility within one year and install an agency approved fish passage at the facility within three years 
in  wpl filed an extension request with ferc for the detailed engineering and biological evaluation of potential fish passages and installation of an agency approved fish protective device 
in  ferc approved extending the evaluation and installation for the downstream fish passage to april and upstream fish passage to april in january  the us fish and wildlife service and wisconsin dnr requested additional changes and further analysis on the fish passage design  delaying the construction plan 
the fish protection equipment construction and installation plans were approved by the us fish and wildlife service and wisconsin dnr in december in march  ferc approved a request to extend the deadlines to complete the construction and installation of a fish protective device to the end of due to unforeseen additional work for the installation of the fish protective device  wpl has submitted a request to ferc for approval for an additional extension to complete the construction and installation of the fish protective device by the end of the design  construction and installation of the fish passages are expected to be completed by the end of wpl believes that required capital investments and or modifications resulting from these issues could be significant 
land and solid waste manufactured gas plant mgp sites ipl and wpl have current or previous ownership interests in and mgp sites  respectively  previously associated with the production of gas for which they may be liable for investigation  remediation and monitoring costs relating to the sites 
ipl and wpl are working pursuant to the requirements of various federal and state agencies to investigate  mitigate  prevent and remediate  where necessary  the environmental impacts to property  including natural resources  at and around the sites in order to protect public health and the environment 
refer to note e of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for estimates of the range of remaining costs to be incurred for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of ipl s and wpl s mgp sites 
missouri electric works legal action in  ipl was served with a lawsuit filed by the epa against named defendants to recover costs incurred for investigation and remediation of the missouri electric works  inc mew site in cape girardeau  missouri 
ipl had previously been served a complaint in  filed by the mew site trust fund  the potentially responsible party group involved 
in may  in deciding ipl s motion for summary judgment  the us district court for the eastern district of missouri agreed with ipl s long standing position that ipl is not a liable party at the mew superfund site 
in september  the us district court issued a final order granting ipl s motion for entry of a final judgment that was in favor of ipl 
in november  the us department of justice doj filed an appeal with the us court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
in february  the doj withdrew its appeal  and the underlying decision that ipl is not liable at this site remains intact 
ash landfill sites in  ipl received notification from the iowa dnr regarding groundwater monitoring of four of its closed ash landfills and the need to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at two of its closed landfills 
the iowa dnr approved ipl s plans to evaluate potential offsite groundwater impacts at these two landfills  which were implemented beginning april work was completed at one of the landfills in june and work is currently pending at the other landfill due to delays with obtaining access agreements from neighboring property owners 
the iowa dnr is aware of the access agreement delays and may intercede with the property owners if necessary 
ipl provides periodic updates on the status of implementing the monitoring plan to the iowa dnr 
monitoring results will be used to determine if further measures are required and ipl is currently unable to predict the outcome 
ash ponds alliant energy  ipl and wpl are monitoring potential regulatory changes which may affect the rules for operation and maintenance of ash ponds and or landfills  in the wake of recent ash pond failures at another utility 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to predict the outcome of any potential regulatory changes at this time 
land and solid waste regulatory issues alliant energy  ipl and wpl are also monitoring various other land and solid waste regulatory changes 
this includes a potential epa regulation for management of coal combustion product in landfills and surface impoundments that could require installation of monitoring wells at some facilities and an ongoing expanded groundwater monitoring program 
compliance with the polychlorinated biphenyls pcb fix it rule persistent organic pollutants treaty could possibly require replacement of all electrical equipment containing pcb insulating fluid which is a substance known to be harmful to human health 
the wisconsin department of commerce has drafted a new rule related to flammable  combustible and hazardous liquids stored in above ground storage tanks 
this draft rule has not yet been finalized 
the primary financial impact of this new rule would be from a secondary containment requirement for all new hazardous materials tanks and for new hazardous material unloading areas 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are unable to predict the outcome of these possible regulatory changes at this time  but currently believe that the required capital investment and or modifications resulting from these potential regulations could be significant

other matters market risk sensitive instruments and positions alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s primary market risk exposures are associated with commodity prices  investment prices  currency exchange rates and interest rates 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl have risk management policies to monitor and assist in controlling these market risks and use derivative instruments to manage some of the exposures 
refer to notes i and of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s derivative instruments 
commodity price risk alliant energy  ipl and wpl are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electric  coal and natural gas products they procure and market 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl employ established policies and procedures to mitigate their risks associated with these market fluctuations including the use of various commodity derivatives and contracts of various durations for the forward sale and purchase of these commodities 
specifically  ipl and wpl have entered into several commodity derivative instruments and physical fixed price commodity purchases to substantially hedge their open positions related to electric supply in however  ipl and wpl still have some exposure to commodity risk as a result of changes in their forecasted electric demand and expected availability of their generating units  among other issues 
alliant energy s exposure to commodity price risks in its utility business is also significantly mitigated by current rate making structures in place for recovery of its electric fuel and purchased energy costs fuel related costs as well as its cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
ipl s electric and gas tariffs and wpl s gas and wholesale electric tariffs provide for subsequent adjustments to its rates for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs 
ipl s and wpl s rate mechanisms  combined with commodity derivatives  significantly reduce commodity risk associated with their electric and gas margins 
wpl s retail electric margins have the most exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices for alliant energy due largely to the current retail recovery mechanism in place in wisconsin for fuel related costs 
wpl s retail electric rates are based on forecasts of forward looking test year periods and include estimates of future fuel related costs per mwh anticipated during the test periods 
during each electric retail rate proceeding for wpl that includes fuel costs  the rate orders approved by the pscw set cost per mwh fuel monitoring ranges 
if wpl s actual fuel related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges during the test period  wpl can request and the pscw can authorize an adjustment to future retail electric rates 
as part of this process  the pscw may authorize an interim fuel related rate increase or decrease until final rates are approved 
however  if an interim rate increase is granted and the final rate increase is less than the interim rate increase  wpl would refund the excess collection to customers  including interest  at the current authorized return on equity rate 
as part of wpl s retail rate case order effective jan 
  the pscw approved annual forecasted fuel related costs per mwh of based on million of variable fuel costs for wpl s test period and left unchanged the annual fuel monitoring range of plus or minus 
based on the current retail recovery mechanism  alliant energy and wpl have exposure to wpl s retail electric margins from increases in fuel related costs above the forecasted fuel related costs per mwh used to determine electric rates to the extent such increases are not recovered through prospective fuel only retail rate changes 
alliant energy and wpl have additional commodity price risk resulting from the lag inherent in obtaining any approved retail rate relief for potential increases in fuel related costs above the fuel monitoring ranges and the prospective nature of any retail rate relief which precludes wpl from recovering under recovered costs from ratepayers in the future 
alliant energy and wpl are unable to determine the anticipated impact of changes in commodity prices on their future retail electric margins given the uncertainty of how future fuel related costs will correlate with the retail electric rates in place and the outcome of the proposed changes to the current retail electric fuel related cost recovery rules in wisconsin 
refer to rates and regulatory matters for additional details of the retail rate recovery mechanism in wisconsin for electric fuel related costs including potential changes to wpl s electric fuel related cost recovery mechanism and the pscw s approval of wpl s electric risk management plan in october alliant energy and wpl also have exposure to market fluctuations in commodity prices of certain materials procured for its infrastructure investment program 
in  corporate services  as agent for ipl and wpl  entered into a master supply agreement with vestas to purchase mw of wind turbine generator sets and related equipment 
the master supply agreement includes pricing terms which are subject to change if steel prices change by more than between measurement dates defined in the master supply agreement 
assuming changes in steel prices are sufficient to warrant a change in the pricing terms  the impact of each incremental increase decrease in steel prices will increase decrease the anticipated purchase price of the wind turbine generator sets and related equipment as of dec 
 by approximately million for alliant energy and wpl 
investment price risk alliant energy  ipl and wpl are exposed to investment price risk as a result of their investments in debt and equity securities  largely related to securities held by their pension and other postretirement benefits plans 
refer to critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits for the impact on alliant energy s pension and other postretirement benefits costs of changes in the rate of returns earned by its plan assets 
currency exchange rate risk alliant energy and wpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in currency exchange rates as a result of corporate services master supply agreement with vestas to purchase wind turbine generator sets and related equipment 
a portion of the future payments under the master supply agreement are denominated in euros  and therefore  are subject to currency exchange risk with fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the impact of a hypothetical increase decrease in currency exchange rates on the future euro denominated payments under the master supply agreement would increase decrease the anticipated purchase price of the wind turbine generator sets and related equipment as of dec 
 by approximately million for alliant energy and wpl 
interest rate risk alliant energy  ipl and wpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance of variable rate short term borrowings  ipl s accounts receivable sale program and variable rate leasing agreements 
assuming the impact of a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in interest rates on consolidated variable rate short term borrowings held  the amount outstanding under ipl s accounts receivable sale program and variable rate lease balances at dec 
  alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s annual pre tax expense would increase decrease by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
alliant energy is also exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of balances of cash and cash equivalents that are currently invested in money market funds with yields that may fluctuate daily 
assuming the impact of a hypothetical basis point increase decrease in interest rates on alliant energy s money market fund investments at dec 
  alliant energy s annual interest income would increase decrease by approximately million

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements 
based on historical experience and various other factors  alliant energy  ipl and wpl believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to their business and the understanding of their financial results as they require critical assumptions and judgments by management 
the results of these assumptions and judgments form the basis for making estimates regarding the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual financial results may differ materially from these estimates 
alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s management has discussed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of their board of directors 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s accounting policies and the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for contingencies alliant energy  ipl and wpl make judgments regarding the future outcome of contingent events and record loss contingency amounts for any contingent events that are probable and reasonably estimatable based upon available information 
the amounts recorded may differ from the actual income or expense that occurs when the uncertainty is resolved 
the estimates that alliant energy  ipl and wpl make in accounting for contingencies  and the gains and losses that they record upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  could have a significant effect on the results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 
refer to note of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of current contingencies that may have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
regulatory assets and liabilities alliant energy s utility subsidiaries ipl and wpl are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  they qualify for the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap and the accounting principles imposed by the regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred as they are probable of recovery in future customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers and amounts collected in rates for which the related costs have not yet been incurred 
ipl and wpl recognize regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators and future regulatory rulings may impact the carrying value and accounting treatment of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and liabilities 
management periodically assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery and the regulatory liabilities are probable of future obligations by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies 
the assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an impact on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these assumptions may result in a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations and the amount of assets and liabilities in their financial statements 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the nature and amounts of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s regulatory assets and liabilities as of dec 
 and asset valuations of long lived assets to be held and used alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s consolidated balance sheets include significant long lived assets  which are not subject to recovery under sfas as a result  alliant energy  ipl and wpl must generate future cash flows from such assets in a non regulated environment to ensure the carrying value is not impaired 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl assess the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered in determining if an impairment review is necessary include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the use of the acquired assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when an impairment review is deemed necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is the larger of the two balances  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl must make assumptions regarding these estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
ipl provides steam service to customers in cedar rapids  iowa 
steam for certain of these customers in downtown cedar rapids was historically generated from ipl s sixth street generating station 
in june  the sixth street generating station was shut down as a result of significant damage caused by severe flooding in downtown cedar rapids 
soon after the flood waters receded  ipl made necessary repairs to the underground steam distribution system and built a temporary steam generating system natural gas fired package boilers and water treatment systems to resume steam service for customers in downtown cedar rapids until a decision was made regarding rebuilding the sixth street generating station 
in january  ipl announced it did not secure the necessary long term contracts with steam customers previously serviced by the sixth street generating station in order to make the investment required to rebuild such facility 
ipl is currently in discussions with steam customers regarding new contracts to provide short to mid term steam service 
at dec 
  ipl had million of long lived assets recognized on its balance sheet for the underground steam distribution system and temporary steam generating system used to provide service to steam customers previously serviced by the sixth street generating station 
recoverability of these assets will primarily be based on future revenues from new contracts currently being discussed with steam customers 
as a result  ipl assessed the recoverability of these assets by estimating the probability of entering new contracts with steam customers and future anticipated cash flows from such contracts 
the probability of entering new contracts and the future anticipated cash flows from such contracts are significant estimates 
a change in these estimates could result in a material asset valuation charge in the future 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility operations 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding estimated unbilled revenue is recorded 
the unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes  estimated customer usage by class  weather impacts  line losses and the most recent customer rates 
such process involves the use of various estimates  thus significant changes in the estimates could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s results of operations 
at dec 
 and  unbilled revenues associated with alliant energy s utility operations were million million at ipl and million at wpl and million million at ipl and million at wpl  respectively

under these rules  certain assumptions are made which represent significant estimates 
there are many factors involved in determining an entity s pension and other postretirement liabilities and costs each period including assumptions regarding employee demographics including age  life expectancies  and compensation levels  discount rates  assumed rate of returns and funding 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefits costs 
assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed annually 
as of dec 
 alliant energy s most recent measurement date  future assumptions included a discount rate to calculate benefit obligations and a annual expected rate of return on investments 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  management reviews various corporate aa bond indices 
the annual expected rate of return is based on projected long term equity and bond returns  maturities and asset allocations

under these rules  certain assumptions are made which represent significant estimates used to determine an entity s income tax assets  liabilities  benefits and expenses each period 
these assumptions include projections of alliant energy s future taxable income used to determine its ability to utilize loss carryovers prior to their expiration and impacts from the completion of audits of the tax treatment of certain transactions 
assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed quarterly by management 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s financial condition and results of operations 
net operating loss utilization as of dec 
  alliant energy estimated that it will be able to generate state net operating income in the future to offset a portion of its current state net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
alliant energy is also currently exploring changes to current business operations and state tax planning strategies that could change these estimates and assumptions 
a change in management s estimates and assumptions related to the amounts and timing of state operating income or loss could have a material impact on alliant energy s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such change occurs 
at dec 
  alliant energy had deferred tax asset valuation allowances related to state net operating loss carryforwards of million 
capital loss utilization as of dec 
  alliant energy estimated that it will be able to generate sufficient capital gains in the future to offset all of its current federal and iowa capital loss carryforwards prior to their expiration 
this assumption is primarily due to the capital gains from ipl s sale of its electric transmission assets in december in addition  alliant energy estimated that it will not generate capital gains in the future to offset any of its current wisconsin state capital loss carryforward prior to its expiration 
a change in management s estimates and assumptions related to the amounts and timing of capital gains and losses could have a material impact on alliant energy s financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such change occurs

property insurance recoveries in  the midwest experienced severe flooding resulting in significant property damage and interruption of operations 
alliant energy has a property insurance policy that provides coverage up to million for certain flood losses incurred by alliant energy and its various subsidiaries including ipl and wpl 
in  management made critical assumptions and judgments regarding which flood losses incurred in were eligible for recovery under its property insurance policy 
these assumptions and judgments form the basis for estimating the million of receivables due under the property insurance policy recognized on alliant energy s and ipl s consolidated balance sheet as of dec 
 refer to note c of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details of estimated property insurance recoveries related to losses from the severe midwest flooding recorded in other future considerations in addition to items discussed earlier in mda  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item and in risk factors in item a  the following items could impact alliant energy s  ipl s or wpl s future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows ipl s electric transmission service charges for in october  itc filed with miso a revised attachment o which calculated the rate itc proposed to charge its customers for transmission services in and was based on forward looking data 
the proposed rate was significantly higher than the rate itc charged ipl that was based on the attachment o ipl filed with miso in  which was based on historic data 
in november  ipl filed a ferc complaint against itc concerning certain cost components included in itc s proposed rates 
itc has requested that the ferc complaint be dismissed on the grounds that the asset sale agreement between ipl and itc barred ipl from challenging the rate elements for a seven year period 
ipl maintains that its complaint does not take issue with the use of forward looking data to set rates and instead is challenging how these rates were implemented 
ferc has yet to set a schedule to address the complaint  which may not be resolved until in january  miso posted the final rate it will bill ipl in for transmission services 
this final rate is higher than the rate itc was charging ipl in based on this level of rate increase for  ipl estimates its electric transmission service charges for will be between million and million higher than alliant energy and ipl currently expect the higher transmission service charges for will have a material adverse impact on their results of operations 
refer to rates and regulatory matters utility rate cases for discussion of the iowa retail electric rate case ipl plans to file in march to address recovery of these higher transmission costs in pension and other postretirement benefits costs for alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s pension and other postretirement benefit costs for are currently expected to be higher than costs by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the higher pension and other postretirement benefits costs are primarily due to significant decreases in plan assets resulting from financial market conditions during refer to note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the funded status of alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s pension and other postretirement benefits plans 
in december  wpl received approval from the pscw to defer  and record carrying costs on  the retail portion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in excess of the million used to set retail rates for wpl will seek recovery of any deferred costs in its next retail base rate case 
wpl s wholesale portion of pension and other postretirement benefits costs will be pursued for recovery under established formulaic ratemaking procedures 
refer to rates and regulatory matters utility rate cases for discussion of the iowa retail electric rate case ipl plans to file in march to address recovery of these higher pension and other postretirement benefits costs in electric sales projections economic conditions alliant energy  ipl and wpl are expecting lower retail electric sales demand in compared to partially due to economic conditions in their service territories 
electric sales demand from industrial customers in is expected to be impacted the most by economic conditions as a result of bankruptcies  plant closures and shift reductions at several manufacturing customers in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s service territories that were announced in and early alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to estimate the impacts of economic conditions on their future electric sales demand and electric margins 
customer owned generation archer daniels midland  owner of wet corn milling plants in iowa and one of ipl s largest industrial customers  is currently constructing two one is mw and one is mw cogeneration facilities in clinton  iowa to meet its own electric demand 
these cogeneration facilities are currently expected to result in a reduction in ipl s electric industrial sales demand and have a negative impact on alliant energy s and ipl s electric margins beginning as early as the first quarter of ethanol production ethanol production in the us experienced significant growth since largely due to a mandate for ethanol usage in the energy policy act of and the promotion of e  a blend of ethanol and gasoline  used to fuel vehicles 
ethanol production facilities in the us are concentrated in the corn growing regions in the midwest given corn is the primary raw material used to produce ethanol 
electricity demand from new ethanol production facilities located in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s utility service territories has resulted in an increase in electric sales volumes over the past couple of years 
currently there are four ethanol plants that are under construction within ipl s service territory 
once completed  these plants may add another mw of electricity demand to alliant energy s existing demand from ethanol plants  which is approximately mw approximately mw in ipl s service territory and mw in wpl s service territory today 
a number of previously announced plants in alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s service territories have not begun construction  which is reflective of a nationwide slowdown in the construction of ethanol production facilities 
this slowdown has been caused by a number of factors including changes in the price of ethanol  a decline in the cost of gasoline  an increase in the cost of corn  tighter access to financing and escalation of construction costs to build the production facilities 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to estimate the impacts ethanol production facilities in its service territory will have on its future electric sales demand and electric margins 
incentive compensation plans alliant energy s total compensation program includes an incentive compensation program icp which provides substantially all of its non bargaining employees an opportunity to receive annual short term incentive cash payments based on the achievement of specific annual corporate goals including  among others  earnings per share from continuing operations and cash flows from operations 
funding of the icp is designed so that alliant energy retains all earnings up to a pre established earnings target 
after achieving such target  there is a sharing mechanism of earnings between alliant energy and employees up to an established maximum funding amount for the icp 
in addition  the total compensation program for certain key employees includes long term incentive awards issued under an equity incentive plan eip 
refer to note b of alliant energy s notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of outstanding awards issued under alliant energy s eip 
alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts these incentive compensation plans will have on their future financial condition or results of operations 
production tax credits alliant energy s  ipl s and wpl s corporate strategy includes building or acquiring several wind projects to produce electricity to meet customer demand and renewable portfolio standards 
in addition to producing electricity  these wind projects may also generate material production tax credits depending on when they begin commercial operations and the electricity output generated by the wind projects 
the american recovery and reinvestment bill of arrb enacted in february provides production tax credits to owners of wind projects placed into service by dec 
 alliant energy s utility generation plan has three wind projects which currently qualify  or are expected to qualify  for production tax credits based on the provisions of arrb 
wpl s cedar ridge wind project mw capacity began commercial operations in december based on current electricity production levels anticipated from the project  wpl expects production tax credits from its cedar ridge wind project of approximately million to million per year for years following the project s commercial operation date 
ipl s whispering willow east wind project mw capacity is expected to begin commercial operation in late or early based on electricity production levels anticipated from the project  ipl estimates potential production tax credits from its whispering willow east wind project of approximately million to million per year for years following the project s commercial operation date 
wpl s bent tree wind project mw capacity is expected to begin commercial operation in pending regulatory approvals for the project 
based on electricity production levels anticipated from the project  wpl estimates potential production tax credits from its bent tree wind project of approximately million to million per year for years following the project s commercial operation date 
any production tax credits generated by ipl s and wpl s wind projects are expected to be utilized in determining customer s rates 
miso market in january  miso launched the ancillary services market  which includes systems and business processes  to complement the existing wholesale energy market that miso implemented in april alliant energy has monitored the development of the market to ensure that the rules associated with the market are reasonable and that costs and revenues associated with the market receive appropriate regulatory cost recovery treatment 
given the changing allocation of generation assets among a fluctuating set of miso reserve zones  alliant energy  ipl and wpl are currently unable to determine what impacts this new market will have on their future financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
