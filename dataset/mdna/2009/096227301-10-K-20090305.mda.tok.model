we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
however  our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face  including but not limited to those risks stated in risk factors  or faulty assumptions on our part 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview bluefly  inc is a leading internet retailer that sells over brands of designer apparel  accessories and home furnishings at discounts of up to off of retail value 
we launched our web site in september our net sales increased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  on a quarterly basis  our net sales increased by approximately   respectively  in the first three quarters and decreased in the fourth quarter  as compared to the same periods in the decrease in the fourth quarter of was a result of the overall downturn in the economy especially in the retail and apparel sector 
our gross margin increased to for the year ended december  from in our gross profit increased by approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin was primarily related to a decrease in inventory reserves as the prior year included approximately  of additional inventory reserves and a write off of inventory of approximately million that occurred at the end of fiscal and a slight decrease in the rate of returns caused by a shift in our merchandise mix 
our operating loss decreased by over  or  to  in from  in this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in share based compensation of approximately  a decrease in marketing expenses of approximately  and a decrease in incremental costs incurred in connection with our transition to the new fulfillment center of approximately  these decreases were slightly offset by increases in selling and fulfillment expenses of  total marketing expenses decreased by to  for the year ended december  from  for year ended december  we decreased our spending in marketing excluding staff related costs by to  for the full year from  for the full year this decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in fixed costs relating to offline programs of approximately and a corresponding shift in variable costs related to online programs  which have increased approximately compared to marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the mix of marketing spend will continue to shift toward online as the company believes that online marketing programs are more efficient as they are more trackable and can be optimized to achieve certain sales goals 
our reserve for returns and credit card chargebacks for the year ended december  slightly decreased to compared to and of gross sales for the years ended december  and respectively 
historically  our merchandise mix had been shifting towards higher end products which tend to drive return rates higher 
during  we refined our merchandising mix to be skewed toward more contemporary merchandise and accordingly  we believe experienced a slight decrease in the return rate 
a portion of our inventory includes merchandise on a pack and hold basis  where we either purchased with the intention of holding for the appropriate season or were unable to sell through in its entirety in a prior season and have determined to hold for the next selling season  subject in some cases to appropriate mark downs 
while we have historically increased the amount of inventory purchased on a pack and hold basis  we have made increased selective purchases of inventory in order to take advantage of opportunities in the current economic environment 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires expensing of stock options on the modified prospective approach 
as a result  we recorded total share based compensation expenses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have developed a new version of our web site  which was placed into service in august we have capitalized a total of  in connection with the development of the new web site  resulting in increased depreciation of approximately  during the year ended december  at december   we had an accumulated deficit of  the net losses and accumulated deficit resulted primarily from the costs associated with developing and marketing our web site and building our infrastructure  as well as non cash beneficial conversion charges resulting from decreases in the conversion price of our preferred stock and the payment of dividends to holders of preferred stock 
although we have experienced revenue growth in recent years  this growth may not be sustainable and therefore should not be considered indicative of future performance  particularly given the challenging economic environment that we now face 
critical accounting policies management estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions include the adequacy of the allowances for sales returns  recoverability of inventories  useful lives of property and equipment  the realization of deferred tax assets  and the calculations related to stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
in addition  we currently estimate that we will have adequate liquidity to fund operations beyond one year from december  such estimate is based on projected revenues  expenses and timing of various payments 
should unforeseen events occur or should actual results differ from current estimates  we may be unable to meet payment obligations as they come due which would have a material adverse impact on our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab 
gross sales consists primarily of revenue from product sales and shipping and handling charges and is net of promotional discounts 
net sales represent gross sales  less provisions for returns  credit card chargebacks  and adjustments for uncollected sales taxes 
revenue is recognized when all the following criteria are met a customer executes an order 
the product price and the shipping and handling fee have been determined 
credit card authorization has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
the product has been shipped and received by the customer 
deferred revenue  which consists primarily of goods shipped to customers but not yet received and customer credits is classified as current liabilities on our balance sheets 
shipping and handling billed to customers are classified as revenue and freight cost incurred in connection with purchasing merchandise is classified as cost of goods sold in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs eitf no 

provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts we generally permit returns for any reason within days of the sale 
accordingly  we establish a reserve for estimated future returns and bad debt at the time of shipment based primarily on historical data 
we perform credit card authorizations and check the verification of our customers prior to shipment of merchandise 
however  our future return and bad debt rates could differ from historical patterns  and  to the extent that these rates increase significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  our returns reserves have been  and  respectively  of sales 
actual charges have not varied materially from historical percentages 
inventory valuation inventories  which consist of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information  about the saleability of such merchandise  the selling price  etc 
based upon this evaluation  we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and establish a reserve for such merchandise 
deferred tax valuation allowance we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is realized in income or loss in the period that included the enactment date 
we have assessed the future taxable income and determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return 
as of the date of adoption  there were no tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months from the date of adoption of fin or from december  as of december  and  the only tax jurisdiction to which we are subject to is the united states 
open tax years relate to years in which unused net operating losses were generated 
upon the adoption of fin  our open tax years extend back to in the event that we conclude that we are subject to interest and or penalties arising form uncertain tax positions  we will present interest and penalties as a component of income taxes 
no amounts of interest or penalties were recognized in our statements of operations or balance sheets upon adoption of fin or as of and for the years ended december  and stock based compensation as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r which requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations data for the years ended december st

the following table sets forth our actual results based on these other metrics for the years ended december st  as indicated below average order size including shipping handling new customers added during the year based on unique email addresses in addition to the financial statement items and metrics listed above  we also report gross sales  which is a non gaap financial measure 
we define gross sales as the total dollar amount of orders received by customers including shipping and handling net of customer credits  but before any reserves are taken for returns or bad debt 
we believe that the presentation of gross sales is useful to investors because it provides an alternative measure of the total demand for the products sold by the company and it provides a basis upon which to measure the percentage of total demand that is reserved for both returns and bad debt 
management uses the gross sales measure for these same reasons

working capital at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have incurred negative cash flows and net losses since inception 
although we have experienced revenue growth in recent years  this growth should not be considered indicative of future performance  particularly given the challenging environment that we now face 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity from current funds and operating cash flow despite the disruption of the capital markets and the continued decline in economic conditions 
moreover  we believe that our existing cash balance  combined with working capital  will be sufficient to enable us to meet planned expenditures under a streamlined business plan through at least the next months 
the streamlined business plan calls for  among other things  reductions in marketing and capital expenditures  delaying new hires and making selective inventory purchases 
in addition  should we experience unforeseen increases in expenditures or should estimated revenues not materialize  these conditions could significantly impair our ability to fund future operations 
should we experience unanticipated losses or expenditures that exceed current estimates  management would implement a cost reduction plan  that includes a reduction in work force as well as reductions in overhead costs and capital expenditures  and or attempt to raise additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain positive cash flows from operations or profitability 
if we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity  future operations will need to be scaled back or discontinued 
standby financing commitment in march  soros and maverick agreed to provide up to  of debt financing to us  on a standby basis  available until march  provided that the commitment amount would be reduced by the gross proceeds of any equity financing consummated during in july  we drew down on the full amount of such commitment 
the draw down is evidenced by subordinated convertible notes 
the subordinated convertible notes have a term expiring three years from the date of issuance and bear interest at the rate of per annum  compounded annually 
interest is payable upon maturity or conversion 
the subordinated convertible notes are convertible  at the holder s option into a equity securities that we might issue in any subsequent round of financing at a price equal to the lowest price per share paid by any investor in such subsequent round of financing or b common stock at a price per share equal to  which represents the day trailing average stock price on the date of issuance of the subordinated convertible notes 
credit facility pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  as amended  wells fargo provides us with a revolving loan and issues letters of credit in favor of suppliers or factors 
the credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
availability under the credit facility is determined by a formula that takes into account a certain percentage of our inventory and a certain percentage of our accounts receivable 
the maximum availability is currently  but can be increased to  at our request  subject to certain conditions 
as of december   total availability under the credit facility was approximately million of which million was committed for letters of credit in favor of suppliers  leaving approximately million available for further borrowings 
the terms of the credit facility contain a material adverse condition clause 
this feature may limit our ability to obtain additional borrowings or result in a default on current outstanding letters of credit 
interest accrues monthly on the average daily amount outstanding under the credit facility during the preceding month at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate plus or libor plus 
we also pay a monthly commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility ie   less the amount of loans outstanding equal to and a servicing fee of  per month 
we also pay wells fargo certain fees to open letters of credit and guarantees in an amount equal to a certain specified percentage of the face amount of the letter of credit for each thirty days of such letter of credit  or a portion thereof  remains open 
total availability under our credit facility is based primarily upon our inventory levels 
in addition  both availability under our credit facility and our operating cash flows are affected by the payment terms that we receive from suppliers and service providers  and the extent to which suppliers require us to provide credit support under our credit facility 
in some instances  new vendors may require prepayments 
we may make prepayments in order to open up these new relationships  or to gain access to inventory that would not otherwise be available to us 
in addition  from time to time we make prepayments in connection with our advertising campaign  as in some circumstances we need to pay in advance of production 
as of december   we had approximately  of prepaid inventory and approximately  of prepaid marketing on our balance sheet compared to  and  as of december  and  and  as of december  commitments and long term obligations as of december   we had the following commitments and long term obligations less than more than total year years years years marketing and advertising operating leases long term obligations employment contracts total commitments and long term obligations we believe that in order to grow the business  we will need to make additional marketing and advertising commitments in the future 
in addition  we expect to hire and train additional employees for the operations and development of bluefly 
com 
however  our marketing budget and our ability to hire such employees is subject to a number of factors  including our results of operations
