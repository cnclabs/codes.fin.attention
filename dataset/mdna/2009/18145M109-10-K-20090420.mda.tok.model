recent events amendment to the credit facility as at january   the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately  as more fully described in this item in the section entitled impairment to goodwill and other intangibles

instability in the newsstand distribution channel in the first quarter of  there was a disruption of the wholesaler distribution supply channel  that caused a significant disruption of services for approximately a four week period 
initially  two of the four wholesalers demanded distribution surcharges from the publishers and national distributors to cover their operating losses and threatened a suspension of service if these price demands were not met 
this resulted in 
table of contents two of the four wholesalers ceasing distribution operations temporarily on february  one of the wholesalers that had ceased delivery of product reached a settlement with the national distributors and publishers concerning pricing and distribution 
the other wholesaler ceased operations in early february  liquidated its holdings and filed a lawsuit in u 
s district court southern district of new york against publishers  national distributors and other wholesalers  alleging the defendants conspired to purge  and through coordinated action have purged  plaintiff from the magazine distribution industry and have destroyed plaintiff s business 
all of the defendants are existing customers of ours and a settlement against them could affect our business 
claim for indemnification on february   the company issued a notice certificate pursuant to the escrow agreement  stating that the company  as buyer  was entitled to receive funds from the escrow in the amount of  the bulk of this claim approximately pertains to damages incurred as a result of the sellers breach of their representations and warranties as contained in the spa 
among other things  sellers failed to deliver the intellectual property required by the spa in the condition represented in the spa 
damages incurred include damages to goodwill  the incremental costs of operating the company s computer system as delivered versus as represented  and the costs of repairing and or replacing the computer system 
impact of economic recession the transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession  downturns in business cycles of our customers  fuel shortages  price increases by carriers  interest rate fluctuations  and other economic factors beyond our control 
many of the company s customers business models are dependent on expenditures by advertisers 
these expenditures tend to be cyclical  reflecting general economic conditions  as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
if economic recession or a downturn in its customers business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers  particularly to the single copy distribution channel  the company s operating results could also be adversely affected 
accounting for the acquisition and related transactions on february   the company consummated the acquisition contemplated by the spa referred to herein as the acquisition  as more fully described in item under the section entitled the acquisition 
at the closing of the acquisition  the company purchased all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of cgi for a total consideration of  of which  was paid in cash and  by the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock valued at per share  the average share price at the announcement of the spa plus an adjustment of  based on cgi s estimated working capital at the closing

by the end of the third quarter of  the entire working capital escrow had been released  all of which was due to the company in accordance with the spa and the escrow agreement  but  of which was paid to the sellers in satisfaction of the aforementioned adjustment to the acquisition consideration based on the working capital at closing as finally 
table of contents determined 
on february   in accordance with the escrow agreement  the company delivered a notice certificate for indemnification under the spa  as described in this item under the section entitled recent events claim for indemnification 
holders of  of the company s shares of common stock voted against the acquisition and elected successfully to convert their shares into a pro rata portion of the trust account approximately per share or an aggregate amount of 
after giving effect to i the issuance of  shares in connection with the acquisition and ii the conversion of shares  there were  shares of common stock outstanding after the acquisition 
in addition  the founders of the company placed  shares of common stock into escrow pending the attainment of a specified market price restricted shares 
as a result of the condition to which the escrowed shares will be subject  such shares will be considered as contingently issuable shares and  as a result  are not included in the earnings per share calculations 
accordingly  the company will recognize a charge based on the fair value of the shares over the expected period of time it will take to achieve the target price  if and only if the expected probability of the share price attaining the specified market price exceeds percent 
the company has accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the cost of the acquisition has been allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon their respective fair values  including identifiable intangibles and remaining cost allocated to goodwill 
the results of operations of the acquired company  cgi  have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements for the weeks ended january   as follows the consolidated statement of operations included revenue and expenses of cgi from december   through february  cgi s income from operations from december   through february   ie  the acquisition date was deducted  as a single line item adjustment 
the final purchase price for the acquisition at closing was determined based on the value of the cash consideration paid by the company  the average value of company s common stock on or about the spa arrangement date  and the direct acquisition costs incurred 
the aggregate purchase price of  represents the sum of i  which represents cash consideration paid directly to cgi s shareholders  ii  deposited in three separate escrows  as described above iii  of deferred acquisition costs paid at closing  iv  of deferred acquisition costs paid prior to closing  and v  for  shares of common stock that were issued to two executive officers of cgi at closing

table of contents a preliminary allocation of the purchase price of cgi to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of cgi on february   was made and recorded during the weeks ended march   and subsequently amended 
the preliminary allocation of the purchase price  including the evaluation and allocation to identifiable intangible assets  recognition of deferred taxes and allocation to goodwill resulting from the acquisition  was made by management 
during the first three quarters of  additional adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation were recorded to goodwill 
in the fourth quarter  it became apparent to management after a detailed review of the information systems  that the intangible with an original estimated value of million identified as software as of the purchase date  was deemed to have no fair value 
this resulted in a purchase price adjustment which reclassified million of the original fair value of the software to goodwill 
in addition  management also adjusted the purchase price allocation after completing a review of the assumptions associated with the non compete intangible  in which a technical error was discovered in the original valuation 
as a result  the non compete intangible s value was considered to be overstated by million and understated goodwill by the like amount 
this adjustment was also recorded in the fourth quarter 
these adjustments resulted in a reclassification of million from identifiable intangibles to goodwill and the deferred tax liability associated with the intangibles along with goodwill were both reduced by million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company  according to sfas  performed its annual goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment tests  and determined that all the goodwill and a portion of the remaining intangible assets had been impaired 
consequently  the company recorded a non cash charge of million for goodwill and million for intangible assets impairment during the fourth quarter of  as discussed in this item under the section entitled impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
the final allocation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of cgi are as follows

the company concluded that its market capitalization had been below its net book value for an extended period of time 
management therefore assessed the fair value of its reporting units using both an income approach with a discounted cash flow model and a market approach using the observed market capitalization based on the quoted price of our common stock 
management compared these values to each reporting units carrying amount  including goodwill and identified an impairment 
the evaluation resulted in a million impairment charge which was included in the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the consolidated statements of operations

these projections assumed an aggressive growth plan for the international division with new distribution centers and the expansion into the shipment of general commodities 
international s percentage of the operating income of the distribution centers before corporate expenses is projected to grow from to during the projection period

the company observed consolidation opportunities return fully to normal during the fourth quarter of  which resulted in additional improved operating efficiency late in the year 
freight moved by intermodal transportation increased in compared to during the second quarter of  flooding in iowa made rail transit to the west coast unreliable 
with rail transit back to normal in the third quarter and the start up of the woodridge facility no longer a factor  the company observed a substantial increase in the use of intermodal transportation in the fourth quarter of  as well for the whole year 
intermodal transportation is generally less expensive than road transportation in the transportation lanes to the west coast 
although international gross revenue for grew over  gross profits for the comparable periods decreased by 
this decrease is the result of a decline in the gross margin resulting from changes in the mix of cwt s international services 
ocean freight tonnage and overland tonnage traditionally carry higher gross margin percentages than do airfreight 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was a result of less ocean and overland freight tonnage and greater airfreight tonnage during the comparable periods

pursuant to the amendment  the lenders revolving loan commitment is now  which we and our subsidiaries may use for working capital  with a  sublimit for letters of credit 
the term loan balance of  remains outstanding 
we may borrow up to the amount of the revolving loan commitment  except that our borrowings under the revolving loan may at no time exceed the sum of our borrowing base as defined in the amendment plus our cash collateralized letters of credit less the amount of the outstanding term loan 
the interest rate charged under the facility was changed to over libor or over the prime interest rate  as applicable 
the non use fee changed to per year and the fee for letters of credit changed to 
the amortization of the term loan has not changed 
the amortization of the identifiable intangibles is a  charge per year for financial statement purposes 
this amortization is not deductible for tax purposes

accordingly  gross revenue and freight consolidation costs for domestic ground freight  international air and ocean freight forwarding services are recognized based upon the relative transit time in each reporting period with expense recognized as incurred 
the company computes relative transit time by considering the mode of transportation and the destination 
domestic ground freight estimates are highly predictable and are based on historical delivery data 
international air and ocean freight transit estimates are based on published third party carrier arrival schedules 
gross profits are gross revenues less freight expense 
cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows  the company considers all short term  highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than days to be cash equivalents 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are recorded at management s estimate of net realizable value

fair value of financial instruments the company s financial instruments consist of accounts receivable  accounts payable and debt 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value 
operating leases the company leases most of its distribution facilities and transportation equipment 
at inception  each lease is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
the company currently has no leases that meet the capital lease requirements  therefore all leases are currently accounted for as operating 
the company records rental expense on a straight line basis 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements 
the company accrues freight expense for any transportation costs that have been incurred  but have not been included in accounts payable 
these estimates are used to substantiate vendor invoices for purchased transportation for shipments that have been completed at the end of the period 
at any time we have about weeks of freight expense accrued domestically and about weeks accrued for international operations

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill represents the excess of cost purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
acquired intangibles are recorded at fair value as of the date acquired using the purchase method 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicates that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test for intangible assets consists of a comparison of its fair value with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair market value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the fair market value is equal to or greater than the unit s carrying value  then goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired 
alternatively  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair market value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter 
other intangible assets  which include non compete agreements and customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years

income taxes the company adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin as of january   accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements and requires companies to use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
the adoption did not impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december  as of january   the company had no material unrecognized income tax benefits  expected changes to unrecognized income tax benefits or interest and penalties 
the company s accounting policy for recognition of interest and penalties related to income taxes is to include such items as a component of income tax expense 
cgi was a subchapter s corporation through february   the date of acquisition 
prior to february   cgi was not subject to federal or state income tax  with the exception of certain states that do not recognize federal s corporation status 
cgi had evaluated the potential tax  interest and penalties relating to this exposure as of december   it was determined to be immaterial 
upon acquisition  cgi s s corporation status was terminated  and after that date  the company will be taxed as a c corporation for federal and state income tax purposes 
the company will file a consolidated income tax return for federal tax purposes and in states where consolidated filings are allowed or required 
the company will file income tax returns in the united kingdom for its discontinued foreign subsidiary for the company will begin filing in all jurisdictions determined by the company to have potential exposure in in addition  the company  as a result of a nexus study  had determined that an increase in the number of states the company currently files in will be implemented 
the impact of these increased filings has been accounted for in the tax provision for the weeks ended january  all tax years since the company s inception september  as filed or yet to be filed are open to examination by the appropriate tax authorities 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes management has developed control processes and procedures that will achieve the following control objectives with respect to fin and uncertain tax positions all material tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns are identified 
the appropriate unit of account is determined for each material tax position 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized 
all tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized 
all previously unrecognized tax positions that subsequently meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized in the first interim period in which the recognition threshold is met 

table of contents all previously recognized tax positions that subsequently fail to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first interim period in which the recognition threshold is no longer met 
the amount of benefit recognized for each tax position is the largest amount that is greater than percent likely to be realized 
new information such as new tax laws  regulations  and court cases that affects the recognition and measurement of the benefits of a tax position is identified in a timely manner and properly evaluated 
the recognition and measurement of the benefits of a tax position reflect all information available to management at the reporting date and do not take into account facts and circumstances and developments occurring after the reporting date but before the issuance of the financial statements 
interest and penalties are properly measured and recorded for all uncertain tax positions 
amounts recorded for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  are properly presented  classified  and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements 
earnings per common share eps prior to the acquisition of cgi  the company s statement of operations had included a presentation of earnings per share for common stock subject to possible conversion in a manner similar to the two class method of earnings per share 
basic and diluted net income per share amount for the maximum number of shares subject to possible conversion is calculated by dividing the net interest income attributable to common shares subject to conversion by the weighted average number of shares subject to possible conversion 
basic and diluted net income per share amount for the shares outstanding not subject to possible conversion is calculated by dividing the net income exclusive of the net interest income attributable to common shares subject to conversion by the weighted average number of shares not subject to possible conversion 
the company measures the effects of options and warrants on diluted eps through application of the treasury stock method  whereby the proceeds received by the company based on assumed exercise are hypothetically used to repurchase the company s common stock at the average market price for the period 
dilution will occur according to the treasury stock method only if the average market price of the company s common stock is higher than the exercise price of either the stock options and or warrants 
when the opposite is present ie  the average market price is lower  the results are antidilutive  and the impact of either the stock options and or warrants is ignored 
the average market price of the company s common stock from january   to january   was and since it was lower than the exercise price of the warrants  the impact of the warrants is excluded from the diluted eps calculation for the week period ended january during the weeks ended january   the average market price of the company s stock was not higher than the exercise price of certain options granted  therefore  the impact of certain stock options is excluded in the diluted eps calculations for the weeks ended january new accounting standards on september   the fasb issued  sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  on november   the fasb granted a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas no 
for non financial assets and liabilities 
this deferral was formalized in february  when the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
the company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of fsp sfas no will have on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this new standard provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
the fasb believes that sfas no 
helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas no 
and no 
this statement is effective beginning january   for the company  with early adoption permitted under certain circumstances 
management did not adopt the fair value election for any assets or liabilities as of the effective date of the standard and therefore the standard had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
