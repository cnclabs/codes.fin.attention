item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in the cautionary statement about forward looking statements below  in item a  risk factors in part i and elsewhere in this annual report 
you should read the following discussion with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this form k 
overview southwestern energy company is an independent energy company primarily focused on the exploration and production of natural gas within the united states 
our operations primarily are located in arkansas  oklahoma  pennsylvania and texas 
we are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead through our established natural gas gathering and marketing businesses  which we refer to collectively as our midstream services 
we have historically operated principally in three segments exploration and production e p  midstream services and natural gas distribution 
effective july   we sold our utility subsidiary  arkansas western gas company awg and  as a result  we no longer have any natural gas distribution operations 
the assets and liabilities of awg were classified as held for sale in our december  balance sheet  however  the results of operations for awg are appropriately consolidated in the statements of operations and are not presented as discontinued operations 
we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we are focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business  which we achieve in our e p business through the drillbit 
we prepare economic analyses for each of the investment opportunities in our e p business and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested  which we refer to as pvi 
the pvi of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a discount rate 
our actual pvi results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments 
we derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our e p business and expect this to continue in the future 
we expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production 
our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natural gas  our ability to control costs and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers 
in recent years  there has been significant price volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict 
these factors  which include weather conditions  political and economic events  and competition from other energy sources  impact supply and demand for natural gas  which in turn determines the sale prices for our production 
in addition  the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices 
we are subject to credit risk relating to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by counterparties in our hedging activities 
the counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes minimizes credit risks 
the credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure 
we have not incurred any counterparty losses in  and related to non performance and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently 
however  given the current volatility in the financial markets  we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 
in  our gas and oil production increased to bcfe from bcfe in the bcfe increase in production was due to an bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play 
increases in our east texas and arkoma net production were offset by decreases resulting from sales of oil and gas properties that occurred during in  our production increased to bcfe 
the bcfe increase in production was due to a bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play which was slightly offset by a net decrease in our other operating areas 
we are targeting gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of approximately over our production 
our year end reserves grew in to  bcfe  up from  bcfe at the end of these increases were also primarily fueled by the continued development of our fayetteville shale play

net income in included a million net of tax gain  or per diluted share  related to the sale of our utility subsidiary that closed july  excluding the million gain on the sale of the utility  the increase in net income in was a result of increased revenues of billion  partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of million and an increase in interest expense of million 
net income in increased approximately to million  or per share  compared to the increase in net income in was a result of increased revenues of million  partially offset by an increase in operating costs and expenses of million and an increase in interest expense of million

operating income for our midstream services segment was million in  compared to million in and million in operating income for our midstream services segment increased in due to an increase of million in gathering revenues and an increase of million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities  which were partially offset by a million increase in operating costs and expenses  exclusive of purchased gas costs 
operating income for our midstream services segment increased in due to an increase of million in gathering revenues and an increase of million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities  which were partially offset by a million increase in operating costs and expenses  exclusive of purchased gas costs 
operating income for our natural gas distribution segment was million for the six months in prior to the utility sale  compared to million in and million in the increase in operating income for our natural gas distribution segment in resulted from a rate increase implemented in august  from colder weather and a decrease in operating costs and expenses 
our capital investments totaled approximately billion in  up from billion in the prior year 
we invested billion in our e p segment in  compared to billion in and million in including million invested in drilling rigs 
funds for our capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations and net proceeds of million from our sales of e p assets and our utility segment 
as a result of our increased cash flow from operations and the proceeds received from asset sales  we were able to lower our total debt to capitalization ratio to at december   down from at december  for  our planned capital investments are billion  compared to our capital investments of approximately billion  and include approximately billion for our e p segment  million for our midstream services segment and million for other corporate purposes 
the billion of e p investments includes approximately billion for the development of our fayetteville shale play and approximately of our e p capital is allocated to drilling 
in addition to the planned investments in the fayetteville shale play  our e p investments in will also focus on our active drilling programs in east texas and other conventional drilling in the arkoma basin 
we expect our capital investments in to be funded from operating cash flow  cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the planned capital program for is flexible and can be modified  including downward  if the low natural gas price environment persists for an extended period of time 
we will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions

production 
gas and oil production was up approximately to bcfe in  as compared to the prior year  due to an bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play  as a result of our ongoing development program and increases in our east texas and arkoma net production which were offset by decreases in net production resulting from the sale of all of our producing properties in the permian and gulf coast 
gas and oil production in was up approximately to bcfe  due to a bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play and a bcfe decrease in our other operating areas 
our net production from the fayetteville shale play was bcf in  up from bcf in and bcf in in the second quarter of  we completed the sale of  net acres  or approximately of our december  total net acres in the fayetteville shale play  and related facilities for million 
production from the acreage sold was approximately mmcf per day at the time of the sale 
additionally  we sold our gulf coast and permian basin properties in the second and third quarters of production from these properties contributed approximately bcfe  bcfe and bcfe to total production in  and  respectively 
gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were up to bcf in and up to bcf in  compared to the prior years 
sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings 
intersegment sales to awg for the six month period prior to the sale of the utility were bcf compared to bcf for the full year of we expect to continue to sell natural gas to the utility through an annual competitive bidding process 
future increases in demand for our gas production are expected to swn 
table of contents come from sales to unaffiliated purchasers 
we are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas  including weather related changes affecting demand for our production 
we are targeting gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of approximately over our production 
based on early production histories and modeling  and assuming continued positive exploration and development results  approximately to bcf of our targeted gas production is projected to come from our activities in the fayetteville shale play 
although we expect production volumes in to increase  we cannot guarantee our success in discovering  developing  and producing reserves  including with respect to our fayetteville shale play 
our ability to discover  develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the availability of capital  the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition 
there are also many risks inherent to the discovery  development and production of natural gas and oil 
we refer you to risk factors in item a of part i of this form k for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations 
commodity prices we periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations  including fluctuations in locational market differentials we refer you to item a of this form k and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the average price realized for our gas production  including the effects of hedges  increased to per mcf in and increased to per mcf in the change in the average price realized reflects changes in average spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities 
our hedging activities decreased the average gas price per mcf in  compared to increases of per mcf in and per mcf in in recent years  locational differences in market prices for natural gas have been wider than historically experienced 
disregarding the impact of hedges  historically the average price received for our gas production was approximately to per mcf lower than average nymex spot market prices due to the locational market differentials 
however  during  and  widening market differentials caused the difference in our average price received for our gas production to be approximately to per mcf lower than spot market prices 
the discount was at its widest point in late due to the impact that the delay in the completion of boardwalk pipeline had upon the centerpoint east differential 
assuming a nymex commodity price for of per mcf of gas  the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately per mcf below the nymex henry hub index price  including the impact of our basis hedges 
we hedged approximately of our production in from the impact of widening basis differentials through our hedging activities and sales arrangements 
additionally  at december   we had basis protected on approximately bcf of our expected gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales arrangements at a differential to nymex gas prices of approximately per mcf 
in addition to the basis hedges discussed above  at december   we had nymex commodity price hedges in place on bcf of our expected future gas production and bcf of our expected future gas production 
we realized an average price of per barrel for our oil production for the year ended december   up approximately from the prior year 
the realized average price of per barrel was up from we did not hedge any of our or oil production 
the average price we received for our oil production in was reduced by per barrel due to the effects of our hedging activities 
assuming a nymex commodity price of per barrel of oil for  we expect the average price received for our oil production during to be approximately per barrel lower than average spot market prices as market differentials reduce the average prices received 
operating costs and expenses lease operating expenses per mcfe for the e p segment were in  compared to in and in lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in and due primarily to higher per unit operating costs associated with our fayetteville shale operations  including the impact that higher natural gas prices had on the cost of compressor fuel in our fayetteville shale production is growing rapidly and is expected to continue to provide upward pressure on our per unit operating costs 
we expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between and per mcfe in general and administrative expenses for the e p segment were per mcfe in  down from per mcfe in and per mcfe in the decreases in general and administrative costs per mcfe in and were due to the effects of our increased production volumes 
in total  general and administrative expenses for the e p swn 
table of contents segment were million in  million in and million in the increases in general and administrative expenses since were primarily due to increases in payroll  incentive compensation and employee related costs associated with the expansion of our e p operations due to the continued development of the fayetteville shale play 
these increases accounted for million  or  of the increase and million  or  of the increase 
we added new e p employees during  compared to employees added in in and  increased expenses associated with leased aircraft and increases in information technology related expenses accounted for most of the remaining increases in general and administrative expenses 
we expect our cost per unit for general and administrative expenses in to range between and per mcfe 
the expected decrease in per unit costs in is due to anticipated increased production volumes from our fayetteville shale play 
future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs  level of pension expense  stock based compensation expensing under statement on financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment fas r and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees 
for eligible employees  a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results  including production  proved reserve additions  present value added for each dollar of capital invested  and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production  while another portion is discretionary based upon an employee s performance 
additional discretionary awards may also be awarded under the incentive compensation plan 
see critical accounting policies below for further discussion of pension expense 
our full cost pool amortization rate averaged per mcfe for  per mcfe for and per mcfe for the decline in the average amortization rate for was primarily the result of the sales of oil and gas properties in  the proceeds of which were credited to the full cost pool 
the amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions  revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance  write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests  proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization 
we cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above  as well as other factors  including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our fayetteville shale play 
based on recent well performance in the fayetteville shale play  we expect the amount of reserves from future wells to continue to increase which would  if all other factors remained constant  decrease our full cost pool amortization rate going forward 
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were million at the end of  compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the increases in unevaluated costs during these periods resulted primarily from the increased activity in our fayetteville shale play 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization 
taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were in  in and in  and vary from year to year due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices 
additionally  we accrued million  or per mcfe  in for severance tax refunds related to our east texas production  compared to million  or per mcfe  in in april  the state of arkansas enacted legislation that will increase the severance tax on natural gas produced within the state to a base rate of  effective january   subject to certain periods of reduced rates for high cost gas wells  new discovery gas wells and gas wells that produce below a specified level 
we have evaluated the impact of the increase in the severance taxes with respect to all of our production within the state of arkansas  including our fayetteville shale operations  and expect that our wells will qualify for the reduced rate exceptions noted above 
we do not expect it to materially affect our results of operations in or beyond 
the timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to our fayetteville shale play could have a material impact on our per unit costs  if production or reserves additions are lower than projected  our per unit costs could increase 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration  development  and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
however  commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting swn 
table of contents period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials 
cash flow hedges of gas production in place at december  increased the calculated ceiling value by approximately million net of tax 
excluding the benefit of the cash flow hedges at december   unamortized costs still did not exceed the ceiling value 
at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  and at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil 
decreases in market prices from december  levels  as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  the evaluation of costs excluded from amortization  future development costs  and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments 
inflation impacts our e p operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on our operations prior to were minimal 
however  since  as commodity prices have generally increased  the impact of inflation has intensified in our e p segment as shortages in drilling rigs  third party services and qualified labor have risen due to increased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry 
we have endeavored to mitigate rising costs by obtaining vendor pricing commitments for multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased economic efficiencies 
during  our e p operations began experiencing decreases in certain costs for third party services primarily due to increased vendor competition in our fayetteville shale operating area 
in late  costs for third party services further declined as competition increased due to decreased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry as a result of the economic turmoil in the united states and abroad 
midstream services year ended december  in millions  except volumes revenues marketing revenues gathering gas purchases marketing operating costs and expenses operating income gas volumes marketed bcf gas volumes gathered bcf revenues and operating income revenues 
revenues from our midstream services segment were up to billion in and up to million in  as compared to prior years 
the increase in marketing revenues for resulted from a bcf increase in volumes marketed and a increase in the price received for volumes marketed 
approximately of the increase in gathering revenues for resulted from increases in volumes gathered related to the fayetteville shale play 
the increase in marketing revenues for resulted from a bcf increase in volumes marketed largely resulting from increased production from the fayetteville shale play  partially offset by a decrease in the price received for volumes marketed 
of the total volumes marketed  production from our e p operated wells accounted for in  in and in increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expenses

operating income from our midstream services segment increased to million in and to million in as a result of the increases in gathering revenues from the fayetteville shale play and increases in the margin generated by gas marketing activities  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
the margin generated from natural gas marketing activities was million for  compared to million for and million for margins may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities and the ultimate disposition of those commodities 
the increases in volumes marketed in and  as compared to prior years  resulted from marketing our increased e p production volumes 
we enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

although our net periodic benefit costs for our pension and other postretirement plans were approximately lower in the second half of compared to the first half of  our pension costs for the year were higher due to the deterioration of the markets in the second half of the amount of pension expense recorded is determined by actuarial calculations and is also impacted by the funded status of our plans 
during  we contributed million to our pension plans and million to our other postretirement plans  compared to million and million  respectively  in the recent decline in the financial markets may require changes in management s assumptions relative to expected return on plan assets which could  in turn  adversely impact the funded status of our pension plans and increase the amount of future contribution requirements

net cash from operating activities provided of our cash requirements for capital investments in  in and in at december   our capital structure consisted of debt and equity  and we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our operating cash flow  the remaining proceeds from our asset sales and available funds under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for the credit status of the financial institutions participating in our revolving credit facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the facility 
while we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds  we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet its obligation under the facility 
current economic conditions make it difficult to access debt and equity markets for funding 
given the unused capacity on our revolving credit facility and our expectations of cash flow from our future operations  we do not plan on accessing those markets in the near term 
our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand factors which are impacted by the overall state of the economy 
the price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities  as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to complete the transaction 
we actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties  performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable  and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions 
however  any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities 
additionally  our short term cash flows are dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and partners 
we actively manage this risk through credit management activities and  through the date of this filing  have not experienced any significant write offs for non collectible amounts 
however  any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and partners could adversely impact our cash flows 
due to the above factors  we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations 
accordingly  we will adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon available cash flow

our capital investments for are planned to be billion  consisting of billion for e p  million for midstream services and million for other corporate purposes 
we expect to allocate approximately billion of our e p capital to our fayetteville shale play  up from approximately billion in our planned level of capital investments in is expected to allow us to accelerate our drilling activity in the fayetteville shale  continue the development of our properties in east texas  continue our conventional drilling in the arkoma basin  maintain our present markets  explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties and generate new drilling prospects 
as discussed above  our capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and the remaining net proceeds from our asset sales 
the planned capital program for is flexible and can be modified  including downward  if the low natural gas price environment persists for an extended period of time 
we will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions 
financing requirements our total debt outstanding was million at december   including million classified as short term debt on our balance sheet  compared to million at december  our senior notes due are putable by the note holders on may   and as a result  the million principal balance of these notes has been reclassified to short term debt in our balance sheet 
if the put option is exercised in  we would use cash available to pay the notes  or alternatively  we would borrow the required funds under our revolving credit facility 
our unsecured revolving credit facility has a borrowing capacity of billion  which may be increased to billion at any time upon our agreement with our existing or additional lenders 
as of december   we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility compared to million outstanding as of december  as discussed more fully below  in january  we issued million of senior notes due  the net proceeds of which were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on the credit facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently basis points over libor 
the revolving credit facility is currently guaranteed by our subsidiaries  seeco  inc seeco  southwestern energy production company sepco and southwestern energy services company ses and requires additional subsidiary guarantors if certain guaranty coverage levels are not satisfied 
our publicly traded notes are rated bb by standard and poor s and we have a corporate family rating of ba by moody s 
any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under the credit facility 
our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us 
under the credit agreement  we may not issue total debt in excess of of our total capital  must maintain a certain level of stockholders equity and must maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of or above 
additionally  there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit agreement at december  although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants  our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as the market prices for natural gas and oil 
if we are unable to borrow under our credit facility  we would have to decrease our capital investment plans 
swn 
table of contents on january   we issued million of senior notes due in a private placement  which are rated bb by standard and poor s and ba by moody s

payment obligations with respect to the senior notes are currently guaranteed by seeco  sepco and ses  which guarantees may be unconditionally released in certain circumstances 
as a result of the issuance of the guarantees of the senior notes  and in order for all of our senior notes to rank equally  on may   we and our subsidiaries  seeco  sepco and ses  entered into supplemental indenture agreements with the trustees under the indentures relating to our medium term notes due  fixed rate notes due october   fixed rate notes due october  and notes due  pursuant to which seeco  sepco and ses became guarantors of such notes to the same extent to which such subsidiaries have guaranteed our senior notes 
we refer you to note  condensed consolidating financial information in this form k for additional information 
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability and or our subsidiaries ability to incur liens  to engage in sale and leaseback transactions and to merge  consolidate or sell assets 
at december   our capital structure consisted of debt and equity  and we had available million in cash and cash equivalents 
our debt as a percentage of total capital declined throughout  primarily due to our operating results and the use of a portion of the proceeds received from our asset sales to reduce debt 
stockholders equity at december   includes a net gain of million in accumulated other comprehensive income related to our hedging activities that is required to be recorded under the provisions of statement on financial accounting standards no

the amount recorded for fas is based on current fair values of our hedges at december   and does not necessarily reflect the value that we will receive or pay when the hedges are ultimately settled  nor does it take into account revenues to be received associated with the physical delivery of sales volumes hedged 
our credit facility s financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the effects of non cash entries that result from fas and fas and the non cash impact of any full cost ceiling write downs 
our capital structure at december  would have been debt and equity without consideration of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity related to our commodity hedge position and our pension and other postretirement liabilities 
as part of our strategy to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations  we have hedged bcf of our expected gas production and bcf of our expected gas production 
the amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital investment plans 
if commodity prices significantly decrease  we may decrease and or reallocate our planned capital investments 
off balance sheet arrangements in december  we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction pursuant to which we sold operating drilling rigs  rigs yet to be delivered and related equipment and then leased such drilling rigs and equipment under leases that expire on january  subject to certain conditions  we have options to purchase the rigs and related equipment from the lessors at the end of the th month of the lease term at an agreed upon price or at the end of the lease term for the then fair market value 
additionally  we have the option to renew each lease for a negotiated renewal term at a periodic rental equal to the fair market rental value of the rigs as determined at the time of renewal 
in  we sold and leased back additional drilling rig equipment receiving proceeds of million  and leased an additional million of drilling rig equipment  under similar terms as the transaction 
in december  pursuant to the terms of the lease  one of the lessors required us to pay million  the stipulated loss value  for a rig that suffered a casualty 
the payment of the stipulated loss value is treated as a purchase of the rig and is reflected in capital investments within the statement of cash flows 
our current aggregate annual rental payment for drilling rigs and related equipment under the leases is approximately million

table of contents critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
however  commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials 
cash flow hedges of gas production in place at december   increased the calculated ceiling value by approximately million net of tax 
excluding the benefit of the cash flow hedges at december   unamortized costs still did not exceed the ceiling value 
we had approximately bcf of future gas production hedged at december  at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  and at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil 
decreases in market prices from december  levels  as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  the evaluation of costs excluded from amortization  future development costs  and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
under the sec s current full cost accounting rules  our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 
under new rules recently issued by the sec that will be effective january   reserves will be priced using the month average price  calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the month period prior to the end of the reporting period 
natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management 
reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property is assigned 
these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and our president and chief operating officer 
final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our board of directors 
in each of the past three years  performance revisions to our proved reserve estimates represented no greater than of our total proved reserve estimates  which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls 
proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process  when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves  as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties 
proved developed reserves account for of our total reserve base at december  assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control 
we refer you to although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited  our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate in item a  risk factors  of part i of this form k for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties  risks and other factors 
swn 
table of contents we engage the services of netherland  sewell associates  inc  an independent petroleum engineering firm  or nsa  to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers 
nsa reports the results of the reserves audit to our board of directors 
in conducting its audit  the engineers and geologists of nsa study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates 
nsa s audit consists primarily of substantive testing  which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately of present worth of the company s total proved reserves 
nsa s audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than of the present worth of our reserves 
the properties in the bottom of the total present worth are not reviewed in the audit 
the fields included in approximately the top present value as of december   accounted for approximately of our total proved reserves and approximately of our proved undeveloped reserves 
in the conduct of its audit  nsa did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests  oil and gas production  well test data  historical costs of operation and development  product prices  or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production 
nsa has advised us that if  in the course of its audit  something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data  nsa did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data 
for the year ended december   nsa issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates  stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are  in the aggregate  reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 
a decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported 
our reserve base is nearly natural gas  therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities 
reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at december   were  million and  bcfe  respectively 
an assumed decrease of per mcf in the december  gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate million decline in our future net cash flows discounted at  adjusted for the effects of commodity hedges  and an approximate decrease of bcfe of our reported reserves 
the decline in reserve quantities  assuming this decrease in gas price  would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool 
the unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates and capitalized costs 
hedging we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability 
we actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties  performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable  and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions 
in recent years  we have hedged to of our annual production 
the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related gas or oil transaction that is hedged 
our derivative instruments are accounted for under fas  as amended  and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
we have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and  to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production  the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income 
results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases 
any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting in addition to a million loss related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges 
future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements 
we did not enter into any interest rate swaps in  or we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this form k for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
pension and other postretirement benefits we record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost  as well as our periodic benefit cost  for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans 
two of swn 
table of contents the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate  which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled  and the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
for the december   benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in  the discount rate assumed is 
for the periodic benefit cost  the expected return assumed is 
this compares to a discount rate of and an expected return of used in using the assumed rates discussed above  we recorded pension expense of million in  million in and million in related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
as a result of the sale of awg on july   we transferred pension and other postretirement assets and liabilities related to the employees of awg to the purchaser 
at december  we recognized a liability of million  compared to million at december   related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
during  we also funded million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in  we expect to fund million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of million and a postretirement benefit expense of million 
assuming a change in the rates lower discount rate and lower rate of return  we would have recorded pension and other postretirement benefit expense of million in gas in underground storage we currently have one facility owned by our e p segment that contains gas in underground storage 
gas in storage that is expected to be cycled within the next months is recorded in current assets 
this current portion of gas in storage is classified as inventory and is carried at the lower of cost or market 
at december  and  the current portion of gas in storage was million and million  respectively 
the non current portion of gas in storage is classified in property  plant and equipment and carried at cost 
the carrying value of the non current gas is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable 
the gas in inventory for the e p segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments  including delivery to customers of awg  especially during periods of colder weather 
as a result  demand fees paid by awg to our e p subsidiaries are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory 
a significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write down of our gas in storage carrying cost

we caution you that forward looking statements contained in this form k are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  incident to the exploration for and development  production and sale of natural gas and oil 
these risks include  but are not limited to  commodity price volatility  third party interruption of sales to market  inflation  lack of availability of goods and services  environmental risks  drilling and other operating risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in item a of part i of this form k 
estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves in this form k are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital investments  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  those estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development investments  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
such variances may be material 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this form k 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and were proved developed non producing 
proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves  by their nature  are less certain than proved developed producing reserves 
estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion 
production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized  if at all  until sometime in the future 
swn 
table of contents the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices  basis differentials and interest rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our board of directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk 
utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is subject to the approval of our board of directors 
these policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
credit risk our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single customer accounted for greater than of accounts receivable at december  see commodities risk below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading 
interest rate risk the following table presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
at december   we had million of total debt with a weighted average interest rate of and we had no indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when deemed appropriate 
we do not have any interest rate swaps in effect currently 
our senior notes due are putable by the note holders on may   and as a result  the million principal balance of these notes is included in the expected maturity below

table of contents commodities risk we use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production and to hedge activity in our midstream services segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the nymex futures market 
these swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price or variable price for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price or fixed price based on a published index referred to as price swaps  transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices referred to as basis swaps  and the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls collars that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor  and a ceiling price above which we pay to the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling 
the primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related gas or oil transaction that is hedged 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties 
the counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks 
the credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure 
additionally  we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable 
we did not incur any losses in related to non performance of these counterparties and do not anticipate any losses given the information we have currently 
however  given the current volatility in the financial markets  we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 
exploration and production the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in commodity prices and that are used to hedge prices for gas production 
the table presents the notional amount in bcf  the weighted average contract prices and the fair value by expected maturity dates 
at december   the fair value of our financial instruments related to natural gas production and gas in storage was a million asset and a million asset  respectively

at december   we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on bcf of  bcf of and bcf of gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in gas and oil sales 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million related to the differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and a loss of million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges 
typically  our hedge ineffectiveness results from changes at the end of a reporting period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract  which is primarily a nymex price  and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged
