table of contents overview significant challenges were presented to dow and the chemical industry as a whole in the first half of the year was characterized by rising feedstock and energy costs  coupled with continued economic weakness in the united states  particularly in the automotive and residential construction sectors 
the latter half of the year was marked by the escalation of a global financial crisis  the landfall of two major hurricanes along the us gulf coast  and the sharp deterioration of the global economic environment 
consequently  in the fourth quarter of the year  the industry saw substantially lower end market demand and steep inventory de stocking across most value chains 
in response  dow shut down or idled capacity and took measures to manage costs and preserve cash  consistent with its commitment to financial discipline 
dow s sales increased percent to billion  setting a new sales record for the company  as a percent increase in prices outweighed a percent decline in volume

fair value measurements the company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in the fair value hierarchy level  or based on the inputs used for valuation 
assets that are traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as level assets and liabilities that are valued based on a bid or bid evaluation are classified as level the custodian of the company s debt and equity securities uses multiple industry recognized vendors for pricing information and established processes for validation and verification to assist the company in its process for determining and validating fair values for these assets 
the company currently has no assets or liabilities that are valued using unobservable inputs and therefore no assets or liabilities classified as level the sensitivity of fair value estimates is immaterial relative to the assets and liabilities measured at fair value  as well as to the total equity of the company

table of contents portfolio managers and external investment managers regularly review all of the company s holdings to determine if any investments are other than temporarily impaired 
the analysis includes reviewing the amount of the temporary impairment  as well as the length of time it has been impaired 
in addition  specific guidelines for each instrument type are followed to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
for debt securities  the credit rating of the issuer  current credit rating trends and the trends of the issuer s overall sector are considered in determining impairment

dividends on february   the board of directors announced a quarterly dividend of per share  payable april   to stockholders of record on march  since  the company has paid a cash dividend every quarter and  in each instance prior to this dividend  has maintained or increased the amount of the dividend  adjusted for stock splits 
during this year period  dow has increased the amount of the quarterly dividend times approximately percent of the time  and maintained the amount of the quarterly dividend approximately percent of the time 
the dividend was reduced in february  for the first time in the year period  due to uncertainty in the credit markets  unprecedented lower demand for chemical products  the ongoing global recession and pending business issues 
the company declared dividends of per share in  per share in and per share in outlook for in  the company maintained its strong financial position in the face of several significant challenges  including the sixth consecutive year of double digit percentage increases in feedstock and energy costs  the escalation of a global financial crisis  the landfall of two major hurricanes along the us gulf coast  and a sharp deterioration in the global economic environment 
in the face of these challenges  dow s actions supported its commitment to financial discipline 
despite the difficult economic conditions in the latter part of the year  the company had sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet all of its business obligations 
looking to  the company is assuming that the weak demand levels seen in late will continue for several quarters  with growth rates in developed economies in north america and europe projected to remain weak well into the first half of the year and possibly for the entire year 
growth rates in developing regions  such as brazil  india  and china  are projected to be more positive than in the developed world  although not nearly as strong as in at this early stage in the year  product inventories across value chains remain low and substantial capacity is still off line 
many end market producers  including those in emerging geographies  are favoring a make to order philosophy until clear demand signs emerge 
historically low inventory levels in north america  coupled with stabilizing commodity prices  are expected to provide some demand lift in the first part of  although it is still unclear if these buying patterns will be short lived 
government stimuli in the latter half of the year could bring greater speed to economic recovery  but it is too early to speculate on the impact of these incentives 
volatility in feedstock and energy costs is expected to continue  adding uncertainty to the company s outlook 
ethylene chain supply fundamentals are expected to be impacted by significant capacity additions projected to start up in as the company continues to implement its strategy in a volatile global economic environment  its focus will remain on financial discipline  with an emphasis on cash preservation measures to ensure financial flexibility 
the company expects to generate positive cash flow from operations in the company will continue to optimize its investment decisions while supporting its key growth initiatives  principally in its performance businesses and in emerging geographies 
the company expects to lower its capital spending in to billion  well below the expected level of depreciation but sufficient to maintain the safety and reliability of the company s facilities and invest for growth 
approximately billion of debt will become due in  including approximately billion of commercial paper and billion of notes payable 
the company intends to meet its scheduled maturing debt obligations with the issuance of new debt 
these actions  along with equity earnings from dow s joint ventures  will help the company to partially offset the challenging economic environment ahead 
in addition  the company will continue to strive to implement its strategic transformation

asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem  are and have been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
based on a study completed by analysis  research planning corporation arpc in january  union carbide increased its december  asbestos related liability for pending and future claims for the year period ending in to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
union carbide also increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion at december  since then  union carbide has compared current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the results of the most recent arpc study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate 
in addition  union carbide has requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity each november since to determine the appropriateness of updating the most recent arpc study 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  and concluded that the experience from through was sufficient for the purpose of forecasting future filings and values of asbestos claims filed against ucc and amchem  and could be used in place of previous assumptions to update the january study 
the resulting study  completed by arpc in december  stated that the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against ucc and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  through was estimated to be between approximately billion and billion 
as in its january and january studies  arpc provided estimates for a longer period of time in its december study  but also reaffirmed its prior advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate than those for longer periods of time 
based on arpc s december study and union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity  union carbide decreased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims million to billion at december  which covered the year period ending in  excluding future defense and processing costs 
following the completion of the review by arpc in december  as well as union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity  union carbide determined that no change to the asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was required 
at december   union carbide s asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion 

table of contents in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its december study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  the resulting study  completed by arpc in december  stated that the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against ucc and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  through was estimated to be between million and billion 
as in its earlier studies  arpc provided estimates for a longer period of time in its december study  but also reaffirmed its prior advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate than those for longer periods of time 
in december  based on arpc s december study and union carbide s own review of the asbestos claim and resolution activity  union carbide decreased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims to million  which covered the year period ending  excluding future defense and processing costs 
the reduction was million and was shown as asbestos related credit in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   the asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was million 
union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  and million at december  in addition  union carbide had receivables of million at december  and million at december  for insurance recoveries for defense and resolution costs 
the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable were based upon current  known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed and or received each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded

environmental matters the company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and emerging remediation technologies 
the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress  or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
at december   the company had accrued obligations of million for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately twice that amount 
the company had accrued obligations of million at december  for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
for further discussion  see environmental matters in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes a and k to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the us pension plans represent approximately percent of the company s pension plan assets and percent of the pension obligations 

table of contents the following information relates to the us plans only  a similar approach is used for the company s non us plans 
the company determined the expected long term rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the board of directors and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class 
the company s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance was also considered 
the expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience 
the expected long term rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year 
the weighted average long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was percent 
this assumption remained unchanged for determining net periodic pension expense 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
the discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the us qualified plans are based on the yield on high quality fixed income investments at the measurement date 
future expected actuarially determined cash flows of dow s major us plans are matched against the citigroup pension discount curve above median to arrive at a single discount rate by plan 
the resulting discount rate decreased from percent at december  to percent at december  the value of the us qualified plan assets decreased from billion at december  to billion at december  the company did not make any contributions to the us qualified plans in the unfavorable impact of asset returns combined with a decrease in the assumed discount rate  resulted in a billion reduction in the funded status from december  to december  at december   the us qualified plans were underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis by billion 
the assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels for the principal us qualified plans is zero percent for  percent for and percent thereafter 
since  the company has used a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations 
the following discussion relates to all of the company s pension plans 
the company bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of plan assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets 
since the market related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of plan assets will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
over the life of the plan  both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized 
at december   net losses of  million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of plan assets 
these net losses will result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market related value of assets and are a component of the total net loss of  million shown under pretax amounts recognized in aoci at december in the table entitled change in projected benefit obligations  plan assets and funded status of all significant plans included in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
the other  million of net losses represents cumulative changes in plan experience and actuarial assumptions 
the net decrease in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains and losses is presented in the following table net decrease in market related asset value due to recognition of prior asset gains and losses in millions total 
table of contents based on the pension assumptions  a reduction in curtailment costs and changes in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior asset losses  the company expects net periodic benefit costs to increase by approximately million for all pension and other postretirement benefits in compared with a basis point increase or decrease in the long term return on assets assumption would change the company s total pension expense for by approximately million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the company s total pension expense for by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the long term return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  both positive and negative  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of billion  after valuation allowances of million 
in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets  the company relies principally on forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences and the availability of tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of billion  million of which is subject to expiration in the years in order to realize these deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  the company needs taxable income of approximately billion across multiple jurisdictions 
the taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration between is approximately million 
the company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
at december   the company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of million 
the company accrues for other tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
at december   the company had a non income tax contingency reserve for both domestic and foreign issues of million

chemical security public and political attention continues to be placed on the protection of critical infrastructure  including the chemical industry  from security threats 
terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concern about the security of chemical production and distribution 
many  including dow and the american chemistry council  have called for uniform risk based and performance based national standards for securing the us chemical industry 
the maritime transportation security act mtsa of and its regulations further set forth risk based and performance based standards that must be met at us coast guard regulated facilities 
us chemical plant security legislation was passed in and the department of homeland security dhs is now implementing the regulations known as the chemical facility anti terrorism standards 
the us transportation security administration tsa and the us department of transportation finalized regulations covering the rail transportation of chemicals as required by the commission act of dow continues to support uniform risk based national standards for securing the chemical industry 
the focus on security is not new to dow 
a comprehensive  multi level security plan for the company has been maintained since this plan  which has been activated in response to significant world and national events since then  is reviewed on an annual basis 
dow continues to improve its security plans  placing emphasis on the safety of dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to address both internal and external identifiable risks 
dow s security plans also are developed to avert interruptions of normal business work operations that could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
dow played a key role in the development and implementation of the american chemistry council s responsible care security code that requires that all aspects of security including facility  transportation and cyberspace be assessed and gaps addressed 
through the company s global implementation of the security code  dow has permanently heightened the level of security not just in the united states  but worldwide 
dow employs several hundred employees and contractors in its emergency services and security department worldwide 
in addition  dow has committed approximately million in capital over a ten year period for plant security  supply chain and cyberspace security enhancements  regulatory compliance and response capabilities as well as other components of dow s security program 
these costs are not considered material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
through the implementation of the security code  including voluntary security enhancements and upgrades made since  dow is well positioned to comply with the new us chemical facility regulations and other regulatory security frameworks 
in addition  dow was the first chemical company to receive support anti terrorism by fostering effective technologies act safety act coverage in from the dhs for the company s mtsa regulated sites and to receive safety act coverage in for the company s rail transportation security services 
this unprecedented certification helps validate dow s efforts and provides additional liability coverage in the event of a terrorist attack 
dow continues to work collaboratively across the supply chain on responsible care  supply chain design  emergency preparedness  shipment visibility and transportation of hazardous materials 
dow is cooperating with public and private entities to lead the implementation of advanced tank car design and track and trace technologies 
further  dow s distribution risk review process that has been in place for decades was expanded to address potential threats in all modes of transportation across the company s supply chain 
to reduce vulnerabilities  dow maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which the company operates 

table of contents dow continually works to strengthen partnerships with local responders  law enforcement  and security agencies  and to enhance confidence in the integrity of the company s security and risk management program  as well as strengthen its preparedness and response capabilities 
dow also works closely with its supply chain partners and strives to educate lawmakers  regulators and communities about the company s resolve and actions to date which are mitigating security and crisis threats 
climate change there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg due to human activities continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the climate 
dow is committed to reducing its ghg intensity pounds of ghg per pound of product  developing climate friendly products and processes and  over the longer term  implementing technology solutions to achieve even greater climate change improvements 
since  dow has reduced its absolute ghg emissions by more than percent  a more rapid reduction than required by kyoto protocol targets  and has achieved a percent improvement in energy intensity the amount of energy required to produce one pound of product since in doing so  it has avoided consuming more than  trillion btus  a savings that when converted to electricity would be more than sufficient to supply the electricity consumed by residential users in the state of california for one year 
through its energy savings  dow has prevented more than million metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere 
this trend could change  however  depending on business growth  capacity utilization and the pace of new technology development 
dow also contributes to the climate change solution by producing products that help others reduce ghg emissions  such as lightweight plastics for automobiles and insulation for energy efficient homes and appliances 
dow has demonstrated its commitment to technological innovation and conservation 
for example  a third party verified life cycle assessment confirmed that the net reduction in ghg emissions resulting from the use of dow thermal insulation in residential and commercial buildings and industrial pipe applications  avoided the emission of ghg to the atmosphere by approximately seven times the total ghg emissions of the company itself 
dow building solutions built a kilowatt solar farm at the company s pittsburg  california site 
this project is the largest solar installation in dow and the first commercial pilot for the company  providing the energy equivalent to power homes 
at dow s carpet latex plant in dalton  georgia  the company will use approximately billion btus of methane gas annually  supplied by a local landfill  to fuel the plant  equivalent to the energy required to heat  us homes annually 
by utilizing landfill gas  dow will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately million pounds annually  which is equivalent to keeping  cars off the road each year 
gains made toward dow s energy efficiency goal will directly impact progress in meeting its climate change goal to reduce ghg intensity by percent a year per pound of product  from a baseline 
dow is studying the life cycle impact of its products on climate change and additional global projects that could offset the company s overall ghg emissions through carbon dioxide reduction 
dow s energy climate change policy and issue management team  formed in  is tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive climate change strategy and is advocating an international framework that establishes clear pathways to help slow  stop and reverse the rate of ghg emissions 
in  dow announced its energy plan for america  which calls for a bold  comprehensive  bipartisan national energy policy that will help strengthen the economy  increase security  clean the environment through the reduction of ghg emissions  and revitalize us manufacturing 
environmental remediation dow accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
the nature of such remediation includes  for example  the management of soil and groundwater contamination and the closure of contaminated landfills and other waste management facilities 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and emerging remediation technologies 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow had an accrued liability of million at december   related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the liability related to remediation at december  was million 

table of contents in addition to current and former dow owned sites  under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law  dow is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where dow allegedly disposed of  or arranged for the treatment or disposal of  hazardous substances 
because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps  and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december  was million million at december  
the company has not recorded any third party recovery related to these sites as a receivable 
information regarding environmental sites is provided below environmental sites dow owned sites superfund sites number of sites at january sites added during year sites closed during year number of sites at december dow owned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed in the united states by the resource conservation recovery act or analogous state law

dow sold its interest in dowell schlumberger in superfund sites are sites  including sites not owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed by superfund law 
the company s manufacturing sites in freeport  texas  and midland  michigan  are the sites for which the company has the largest environmental remediation accruals 
from the start of operations at the freeport site in the s until the mid s  manufacturing wastes were typically placed in on site pits and landfills 
the resulting soil and groundwater contamination is being assessed and remediated under the provisions of the resource conservation recovery act rcra  in concert with the state of texas 
at december   the company had an accrual of million million at december  related to environmental remediation at the freeport manufacturing site 
in  million million in was spent on environmental remediation at the freeport site 
similar to the freeport site  in the early days of operations at the midland site  manufacturing wastes were usually disposed of on site  resulting in soil and groundwater contamination  which has been contained and managed on site under a series of rcra permits and regulatory agreements 
the most recent hazardous waste operating license for the midland site  issued in  also included provisions for the company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off site contamination from historic midland site operations 
the scope of the investigation includes midland area soils  tittabawassee and saginaw river sediment and floodplain soils  and saginaw bay  and requires the company to conduct interim response actions 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
at december   the company had an accrual of million million at december  for environmental remediation and investigation associated with the midland site 
in  the company spent million million in on environmental remediation at the midland site 
in total  the company s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately twice that amount 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

table of contents asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation introduction union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages 
the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past  alleged exposure to asbestos containing products located on union carbide s premises  and union carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem 
in many cases  plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure  or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide s products 
influenced by the bankruptcy filings of numerous defendants in asbestos related litigation and the prospects of various forms of state and national legislative reform  the rate at which plaintiffs filed asbestos related suits against various companies  including union carbide and amchem  increased in  and the first half of since then  the rate of filing has significantly abated 
union carbide expects more asbestos related suits to be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future  and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve  as appropriate  both pending and future claims 
the table below provides information regarding asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem claims unresolved at january claims filed claims settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved claims unresolved at december claimants with claims against both ucc and amchem individual claimants at december plaintiffs lawyers often sue dozens or even hundreds of defendants in individual lawsuits on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of claimants 
as a result  the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to union carbide  amchem or any other particular defendant  even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury 
in fact  there are no personal injury cases in which only union carbide and or amchem are the sole named defendants 
for these reasons and based upon union carbide s litigation and settlement experience  union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos related liability 
estimating the liability based on a study completed by analysis  research planning corporation arpc in january  union carbide increased its december  asbestos related liability for pending and future claims for the year period ending in to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
since then  union carbide has compared current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the results of the most recent arpc study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate 
in addition  union carbide has requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity each november since to determine the appropriateness of updating the most recent arpc study 
in november  union carbide requested arpc to review union carbide s historical asbestos claim and resolution activity and determine the appropriateness of updating its january study 
in response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through october  and concluded that the experience from through was sufficient for the purpose of forecasting future filings and values of asbestos claims filed against union carbide and amchem  and could be used in place of previous assumptions to update the january study 
the resulting study  completed by arpc in december  stated that the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  through was estimated to be between approximately billion and billion

insurance receivables at december   union carbide increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion  substantially exhausting its asbestos product liability coverage 
the insurance receivable related to the asbestos liability was determined by union carbide after a thorough review of applicable insurance policies and the wellington agreement  to which union carbide and many of its liability insurers are signatory parties  as well as other insurance settlements  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  and taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers 
the wellington agreement and other agreements with insurers are designed to facilitate an orderly resolution and collection of union carbide s insurance policies and to resolve issues that the insurance carriers may raise 

table of contents in september  union carbide filed a comprehensive insurance coverage case  now proceeding in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york  seeking to confirm its rights to insurance for various asbestos claims and to facilitate an orderly and timely collection of insurance proceeds 
this lawsuit was filed against insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place with union carbide regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage  in order to facilitate an orderly resolution and collection of such insurance policies and to resolve issues that the insurance carriers may raise 
although the lawsuit is continuing  through the end of  union carbide had reached settlements with several of the carriers involved in this litigation 
union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was million at december  and million at december  at december  and december   all of the receivable for insurance recoveries was related to insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage

summary the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable described above were based upon current  known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed and or received each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded 
because of the uncertainties described above  union carbide s management cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims facing union carbide and amchem 
union carbide s management believes that it is reasonably possible that the cost of disposing of union carbide s asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material adverse impact on union carbide s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of union carbide 
it is the opinion of dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of union carbide disposing of its asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the company

the merger did not close in january  as originally anticipated  in light of the company s determination that recent material developments had created unacceptable uncertainties with respect to the funding and economics of the combined dow and rohm and haas enterprise 
this assessment was based on several macro economic factors such as the continued crisis in global financial and credit markets and unprecedented demand destruction  combined with the failure of pic to fulfill its obligation to close the k dow joint venture transaction and fund the initial purchase price on january  litigation on january   rohm and haas commenced an action in the court of chancery of the state of delaware to compel the company to acquire rohm and haas for in cash per share of rohm and haas common stock plus a ticking fee commencing on january

it is the opinion of the company s management that it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company 

table of contents the dow chemical company and subsidiaries part ii  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  which enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  where appropriate 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non specific exposure within established limits and policies  derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges per sfas no 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global basis  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts  over the counter option contracts  cross currency swaps  and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies 
main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of europe  asia pacific and canada  bonds denominated in foreign currencies mainly the euro  and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the us dollar value of future cash flows 
the majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to european currencies and the japanese yen 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions  and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
feedstocks for ethylene production and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
dow uses value at risk var  stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
through the end of  the var methodology used by the company was based primarily on a variance covariance statistical model 
the year end var and average daily var for the aggregate of non trading and trading positions for and are shown below 
these amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the company total daily var at december in millions year end average year end average foreign exchange interest rate equity exposures  net of hedges commodities using a percent confidence level the company s daily var for the aggregate of trading and non trading positions using the variance covariance statistical model increased from a total var of million at december  to a total of million at december  the increase related primarily to an increase in the interest rate var from million to million  principally due to an increase in interest rate volatility 
in the first quarter of  the company changed its primary var methodology from a variance covariance statistical model to a historical simulation model to more effectively capture co movements in market rates across different instruments and market risk exposure categories 
in the new historical simulation model  a percent confidence level is used and the historical scenario period includes at least six months of historical data 
the new historical simulation model resulted in a composite daily var of million at december   the var calculated for the individual exposure categories was million for foreign exchange exposure  million for interest rate exposure  million for equities exposure and million for commodities exposure
