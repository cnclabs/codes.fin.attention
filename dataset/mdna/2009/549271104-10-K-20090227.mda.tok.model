item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the notes thereto and the selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated financial statements  including trends that might appear  should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those described under the section cautionary statements for safe harbor purposes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview general we are an innovative specialty chemical company that produces and supplies technologies that improve the quality and performance of our customers products in the global transportation  industrial and consumer markets 
our consolidated results for the year ended december  included total revenues of  million 
our business is founded on technological leadership 
innovation provides opportunities for us in growth markets as well as advantages over our competitors 
from a base of approximately  patents  we use our product development and formulation expertise to sustain our leading market positions and fuel our future growth 
we create additives  ingredients  resins and compounds that enhance the performance  quality and value of our customers products  while minimizing their environmental impact 
our products are used in a broad range of applications and are sold into relatively stable markets such as those for engine oils  specialty driveline lubricants and metalworking fluids  as well as higher growth markets such as personal care and over the counter pharmaceutical products  performance coatings and inks and compressor lubricants 
our specialty materials products also are used in a variety of industries  including the construction  sporting goods  medical products and automotive industries 
we are an industry leader in many of the markets in which our product lines compete 
we are geographically diverse  with an extensive global manufacturing  supply chain  technical and commercial infrastructure 
at december   we operated facilities in countries  including production facilities in countries and laboratories in countries  in key regions around the world through the efforts of approximately  employees 
we sell our products in more than countries and believe that our customers recognize and value our ability to provide customized  high quality  cost effective performance formulations and solutions worldwide 
we also believe our customers highly value our global supply chain capabilities 
on december   we completed the acquisition of the thermoplastic polyurethane business from the dow chemical company dow for approximately million in cash  including transaction costs 
the acquisition included technology  trade names  customer lists and manufacturing know how 
we also acquired a manufacturing facility  including equipment and inventory in la porte  texas as part of the transaction 
dow generated approximately million in revenues during from the acquired thermoplastic polyurethane business 
the preliminary purchase price allocation for this acquisition included goodwill of million and intangible assets of million  which includes million of in process research and development 
on march   we announced our decision to launch a year phased investment plan to increase global capacity in our lubrizol additives segment 
we plan to make a greenfield investment in china as well as implement an extensive debottlenecking program at our existing facilities 
as part of the year plan  we signed a letter of intent to reserve land use rights in china for a wholly owned manufacturing plant  which will be developed and phased in as market needs require 
by phasing in selective capacity additions in china  we aim to respond to lubricant growth in asia and better match our manufacturing capability with global demand patterns 
we expect that the debottlenecking and china investment will require capital expenditures of approximately million over the next decade 
we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures in related to this phased investment plan in light of current economic conditions 
on november   we completed the acquisition of the refrigeration lubricants business of croda international plc croda for approximately million in cash  including transaction costs 
the acquisition primarily included lubricant technology  trade names  customer lists  manufacturing know how and inventory 
no manufacturing facilities were included in the transaction 
we began consolidating the results of the refrigeration lubricants business of croda in our consolidated financial statements in november the purchase price allocation for this acquisition included goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 

table of contents on february   we completed the acquisition of a broad line of metalworking additive products from lockhart chemical company lockhart for approximately million in cash  including transaction costs 
we purchased lockhart s entire metalworking product line  which included natural  synthetic and gelled sulfonates  emulsifier packages  corrosion inhibitors and lubricity agents  grease additives  oxidates  esters  soap  semi finished coatings  and rust preventatives 
we began consolidating the results of the metalworking business of lockhart in our consolidated financial statements in february the purchase price allocation for this acquisition included goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
in may  we sold the food ingredients and industrial specialties business fiis and the active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediate compounds business a i  both of which were included in the lubrizol advanced materials segment 
a i and almost all of the fiis divestiture reported into the noveon consumer specialties product line  while a small portion of the fiis divestiture reported into the performance coatings product line 
in  we recorded a million after tax loss on the sale of these divested businesses 
during the first quarter of and in connection with the held for sale classification  we performed an impairment test resulting in a million after tax impairment charge in the first quarter of we have reflected the results of these divested businesses in the discontinued operations net of tax line item in the consolidated statement of operations for lubrizol additives segment challenging industry market forces and conditions continue to influence the lubrizol additives segment 
a key factor is the low long term global growth rate for this market  which we believe is in the range of approximately to per year 
additional characteristics of this market are frequent product specification changes primarily driven by original equipment manufacturers oems and the impact of environmental and fuel economy regulations on the oems 
the specification changes require us to incur product development and testing costs  but also enable us to apply our technology know how to create products and solve problems 
we believe our technology  and our expertise in applying it  are key strengths 
improved engine design  which can result in longer lubricant drain intervals 
longer drain intervals reduce demand for finished lubricants 
new vehicle production levels  which affect our driveline fluids in particular because the initial factory fill is an important market factor in that product line 
in recent years  a general tightening of supplies leading to significant increases in raw material and energy costs 
we believe we are the market leader in lubricant additives and intend to remain the leader by continuing to invest in this business 
our strategy is to continue to optimize our product line mix while closely aligning production capacity with product demand 
our lubrizol additives segment represents approximately of consolidated revenues 

table of contents lubrizol advanced materials segment our lubrizol advanced materials segment s growth strategy involves a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
our internal growth strategy in the lubrizol advanced materials segment is to use our strengths  including our technology  formulating skills and broad geographic infrastructure  to develop and invest in new performance technologies in higher growth industrial and consumer markets 
in addition to internal growth  we intend to pursue bolt on acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the thermoplastic polyurethane business from dow in  that we expect to provide cost synergies  new technology and the opportunity to take existing products into new geographies 
key factors to our success continue to be the introduction of new products  development of new applications for existing products  cross selling of products  the integration of future acquisitions and geographic expansion 
our lubrizol advanced materials segment represents approximately of consolidated revenues 
primary factors affecting results from continuing operations the factors that most affected our consolidated results were our ability to recover raw material cost increases and increased operating costs 
average raw material cost increased in after increasing in and in our results were affected by how quickly and the extent to which we were able to raise selling prices in response to raw material and other cost increases 
both the lubrizol additives and lubrizol advanced materials segments implemented several price increases in in response to continuing increases in these costs 
the significant global economic weakness during the fourth quarter of that affected the markets we serve  which negatively impacted our results 
as a result of the weak fourth quarter  volume declined for the full year of volume declined in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in as demand declined sharply and customers reduced their inventory levels 
a goodwill impairment charge of million associated with our performance coatings and engineered polymers product lines 
the impairment charge reflects the full impairment of the performance coatings product line goodwill and is driven mainly by the product line s weak current performance and outlook 
the goodwill impairment charge also includes the partial impairment of goodwill within our engineered polymers product line and is driven mainly by the increase in our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of and to a lesser extent  a reduction in their near term earnings outlook 
while the outlook for these product lines dampened in the fourth quarter of  we continue to view them as integral to our company 
a favorable currency impact on our revenues of in the lubrizol additives segment and in the lubrizol advanced materials segment 
while we experienced an increase in operating costs from changes in foreign currencies  we estimate that our overall results during benefited by per share from a net favorable currency impact 
increased operating costs due to general salary and benefit cost increases  unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption and costs associated with the implementation of a common information systems platform primarily in the lubrizol advanced materials segment 
restructuring and impairment charges of million related to business improvement initiatives in the performance coatings product line of the lubrizol advanced materials segment  the decision to close a lubrizol additives blending  packaging and warehouse facility in ontario  canada  and the impairment of long lived assets in our performance coatings product line 

table of contents results of operations compared with for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million compared with net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease in earnings primarily was due to an increase in restructuring and impairment charges  including a goodwill impairment charge of million  higher raw material and manufacturing costs and a decrease in volume  offset by an improvement in the combination of price and product mix  a favorable currency impact and contributions from acquisitions

table of contents cost of sales the increase in cost of sales in compared with primarily was due to higher raw material and manufacturing costs 
average raw material cost increased in compared with total manufacturing expenses increased in compared with primarily due to an unfavorable currency impact  increased utilities  higher salaries and benefits  and unfavorable manufacturing cost absorption due to the temporary shutdown of our two houston area manufacturing facilities from hurricane ike and the temporary shutdown of production lines in the fourth quarter to manage inventory levels in response to market conditions 
the increase in manufacturing expenses partially was offset by lower environmental related charges in on a per unit sold basis  manufacturing costs increased in compared with gross profit gross profit increased million in compared with  as improvements in the combination of price and product mix and a favorable currency impact were offset by higher raw material and manufacturing costs and lower volume 
our gross profit percentage decreased to in compared with in as the increase in revenues from pricing improvements to recover higher raw material and manufacturing costs was substantially greater than the increase in gross profit dollars 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared with the decrease primarily reflects a reduction in incentive compensation expense  partially offset by an unfavorable currency impact and an increase associated with the implementation of a common information systems platform primarily in the lubrizol advanced materials segment 
research  testing and development expenses the timing and amount of research  testing and development expenses technology expenses are affected by lubricant additives product standards  which change periodically to meet new emissions  efficiency  durability and other performance factors as oems improve engine and transmission designs 
technology expenses increased million  or  in compared with primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits and higher outside testing expenses 
write off of acquired in process research and development we included a charge of million in to write off the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development ipr d projects associated with the acquisition of the thermoplastic polyurethane business from dow 
costs to acquire ipr d projects that have no alternative future use and that have not yet reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition are expensed for acquisitions completed prior to january  restructuring and impairment charges the components of the restructuring and impairment charges are detailed as follows asset other plant severance in millions of dollars impairments exit costs and benefits total goodwill impairment charges performance coatings business improvement initiatives lubrizol advanced materials product line impairments and workforce reductions lubrizol additives plant closure and workforce reductions total restructuring and impairment charges after performing our annual goodwill impairment test as of october   we determined that million of goodwill associated with our performance coatings  estane and temprite reporting units was impaired as the carrying value of goodwill within these reporting units exceeded its fair value 
we use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the impairment charge reflects the full impairment of the goodwill of the performance coatings reporting unit and is driven mainly by the reporting unit s weak current performance and updated outlook reflecting current economic conditions 
the impairment charge also includes the partial impairment of the goodwill of the estane and temprite reporting units and is driven mainly by the increase in our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of and to a lesser extent  a reduction in their near term earnings outlook 
business improvement initiatives and impairments of long lived assets primarily within the performance coatings product line of the lubrizol advanced materials segment resulted in restructuring and impairment charges of million during we completed the disposition of a textile compounding plant and recognized an asset 
table of contents impairment for a textile coatings production line in the first quarter of in the second quarter of  we announced additional steps to improve the profitability of our us performance coatings business 
manufacturing of certain products at various locations will cease or be transferred to more efficient production facilities in order to align manufacturing with our end use markets 
in addition  we restructured the sales  marketing and research and development organizations within our performance coatings product line in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge associated with long lived assets in our performance coatings product line as a result of declining demand in our textile applications 
the long lived asset impairment charges represent the excess of carrying value of the asset groups over their fair value 
the fair value of the asset groups was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows attributable to the asset groups over their remaining useful life 
in the third quarter of  we decided to close a lubrizol additives blending  packaging and warehouse facility in ontario  canada that resulted in charges of million 
we expect operations at the facility to end by june  we expect to record an additional million of restructuring charges related to this facility closure  of which million is expected to be recognized in we expect the business improvement initiatives and facility closures that we have announced to date to generate cost savings of approximately million in other income net other income net was million in compared with other income net of million in other income net in primarily consisted of foreign currency gains of million 
other income net of million in primarily consisted of a million gain recorded on the sale of land and foreign currency gains of million

our million revolving credit facility  which matures in september  allows us to borrow at variable rates based on euribor plus a specified credit spread 
we have guaranteed all obligations of the borrowers under the euro credit facility 
at december   we had million and million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
under our credit facilities  we are required to comply with financial ratios of debt to consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  extraordinary  unusual or non recurring non cash gains or losses  including the sale of property and equipment and goodwill impairments  and non cash gains or losses from less than wholly owned subsidiaries and investments consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreements  and consolidated ebitda to interest expense 
for the year ended december   the credit agreements required that the ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda be less than and the ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense must be greater than at december   we maintained a ratio of debt to consolidated ebitda of and a ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of in february  we entered into a million term loan 
the term loan is an unsecured  senior obligation of the company that matures on february   and bears interest based upon libor plus a specified credit spread 
beginning in april  we are required to make quarterly principal payments 
the total annual principal payments are million in  million in and million in the term loan is prepayable without penalty

we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from these notes to repay in full at maturity the million remaining aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  due on october  we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from these notes for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had a million investment in a money market mutual fund that froze all distributions on september  due to liquidity constraints 
although we gave our redemption notice to this fund prior to september   we have not yet received our full distribution 
our original investment in this money market mutual fund was million 
this fund is being liquidated under the supervision of the securities and exchange commission sec 
accordingly  our holding in this money market mutual fund was no longer classified as a cash equivalent at december  due to its change in liquidity 
we anticipate receiving distributions for the remainder of our holding throughout we believe that our cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and our current cash and cash equivalents provide sufficient liquidity to maintain our current operations  pay dividends  pursue acquisitions and service our debt 
the current decline in our cash flow from operations is the result of an increase in working capital requirements due to higher raw material costs and a significant decline in volume during the fourth quarter of we expect our future level of cash flow from operations to improve upon the stabilization in raw material costs and the reduction in our inventory levels 
however  in response to the current economic conditions  we have suspended temporarily our share repurchase program and will limit or defer capital expenditures where possible as a precaution in order to preserve liquidity 

table of contents contractual cash obligations the following table shows our contractual cash obligations under debt agreements  leases  non cancelable purchase commitments and other long term liabilities at december  payments due by period in millions of dollars total and after total debt interest operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations total debt includes both the current and long term portions of debt as reported in note to the consolidated financial statements  excluding original issue discounts and unrealized gains on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges of fixed rate debt 
represents estimated contractual interest payments for fixed rate debt only 
we are not able to estimate reasonably the cash payments for interest associated with variable rate debt due to the significant estimation required relating to both market interest rates as well as projected principal payments 
non cancelable purchase commitments primarily include raw materials purchased under take or pay contracts  drumming  service contracts  utility purchase agreements and toll processing arrangements 
we are required to make minimum contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans pursuant to the minimum funding requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and the employee retirement income security act of  as amended 
funding requirements for plans outside the united states are subject to applicable local regulations 
in  we expect to make employer contributions of approximately million to the qualified plans to satisfy these minimum statutory funding requirements 
the expected payments associated with these plans represent an actuarial estimate of future assumed payments based upon retirement and payment patterns 
in addition  non pension postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate million in we have included these expected contributions of million in the above table 
due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to the company s pension and non pension postretirement benefit plans  including i interest rate levels  ii the amount and timing of asset returns  and iii what  if any  changes may occur in pension funding legislation  the estimates in the table may differ materially from actual future payments 
the company can not reasonably estimate payments beyond other long term liabilities disclosed in the table represent long term liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheet at december  under noncurrent liabilities  excluding pension  postretirement  postemployment  environmental and other non contractual liabilities 
at december   we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million relating to uncertain tax positions 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these tax positions  we are unable to estimate when cash settlement may occur 

table of contents our debt level will require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments  thereby reducing the availability of our cash for acquisitions or other purposes 
nevertheless  we believe our future operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover debt service  capital expenditures  dividends and other obligations  and that we have untapped borrowing capacity that can provide us with additional financial resources 
we currently have a shelf registration statement filed with the sec pursuant to which debt securities  preferred or common shares  or warrants may be issued 
in addition  at december   we maintained cash and cash equivalents balances of million and had million available under our us revolving credit facility and million available under our euro revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no special purpose entities or off balance sheet debt  other than operating leases in the ordinary course of business  which are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had million of contingent obligations under standby letters of credit issued in the ordinary course of business to financial institutions  customers and insurance companies to secure short term support for a variety of commercial transactions  insurance and benefit programs 
in connection with the sale of the fiis business to spm group holdings  llc  now known as emerald performance materials  llc emerald  in may  we provided indemnifications to emerald with respect to the business sold 
these indemnifications have been associated with the price and quantity of raw material purchases  permit costs  costs incurred due to the inability to obtain permits and environmental matters 
the indemnifications related to the price of raw material purchases expired on december   with the remaining indemnifications expiring on december  in each of these circumstances  our payment is dependent on emerald filing a claim 
in addition  our obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount 
for those indemnification agreements where a payment by us is probable and estimable  we recorded a liability at december  we believe that if losses are incurred in any of these matters  such losses would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates at a specific point in time that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have utilized available information including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming our estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating our estimates inherent in these financial statements may not materialize 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to similar businesses 
accounting for sales discounts and rebates we offer sales discounts and rebates to certain customers to promote customer loyalty and to encourage greater product sales 
these rebate programs provide that upon the attainment of pre established volumes or the attainment of revenue milestones for a specified period  the customer receives credits against purchases 
we estimate the provision for rebates based upon the specific terms in each agreement at the time of shipment and an estimate of the customer s achievement of the respective revenue milestones 
we accrue customer claims  returns and allowances and discounts based upon our history of claims and sales returns and allowances 
the estimated provisions significantly could be affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
accounting for reserves and contingencies our accounting policies for reserves and contingencies cover a wide variety of business activities  including reserves for potentially uncollectible receivables  slow moving or obsolete inventory and legal and environmental exposures 
we accrue these reserves when our assessments indicate that it is probable that we have incurred a liability or will not recover an asset and we can reasonably estimate an amount 
for income tax exposures  we only 
table of contents recognize the economic benefit associated with a tax position if it is more likely than not that we will ultimately sustain a tax position 
after this threshold is met  we report an income tax position at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be ultimately sustained 
we review these estimates quarterly based on currently available information 
actual results may differ from our estimates and our estimates may be revised depending upon the outcome or changed expectations based on the facts surrounding each exposure 
we discuss annually with the audit committee of our board of directors our reserves and contingencies  as well as our policies and processes for evaluating them 
determination of net periodic pension cost each year we review with our actuaries the actuarial assumptions used in the determination of net periodic pension cost  as prescribed by statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the determination of net periodic pension cost is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions 
the two most critical assumptions are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
the return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions are influenced significantly by conditions within the debt and equity markets 
a sustained depression in the returns of debt and equity securities could cause a reduction in our assumed return on plan assets 
volatility in the corporate debt markets directly impacts the assumed discount rate  which is based on the returns on high quality debt instruments 
other assumptions include the rate of compensation increase and demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover 
we review the critical assumptions for our pension plans with the audit committee of our board of directors 
our net periodic pension cost for our us pension plans was million in  million in and million in our net periodic pension cost for all pension plans was million in  million in and million in the net periodic pension cost for all plans included a settlement loss of million in and million in no settlement loss was incurred in in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
in developing our assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we considered historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio 
at december   our us pension plans assets had an investment mix that approximated in equity securities and in debt securities  while our non us pension plans assets had an investment mix that approximated in equity securities and in debt securities 
in determining net periodic pension cost for the year ended december   our weighted average assumptions for the us pension plans and us pension plans was and on a weighted average basis for all plans  respectively  based on our investment mix and projected market conditions 
we believe our expected long term rates of return represent a reasonable return that could be achieved over the long term using our current asset allocation 
a change in the rate of return of basis points would have had the following effects on net periodic pension cost basis point in millions of dollars increase decrease us pension plans international pension plans all pension plans the selection of a discount rate for pension plans is required to determine the value of future pension obligations and represents our best estimate of our cost in the marketplace to settle all pension obligations through annuity purchases 
we determined the discount rate based upon current market indicators  including yields from published bond portfolios that provide for a general matching of bond maturities with the projected benefit cash flows from our plans 
the published bond portfolios consist of non callable corporate bonds that are at least aa quality 
in determining net periodic pension cost for the year ended december   we set our weighted average discount rates for the us pension plans and us pension plans at and on a weighted average basis for all plans  respectively 

table of contents a change in the discount rate of basis points would have had the following effects on net periodic pension cost basis point in millions of dollars increase decrease us pension plans international pension plans all pension plans we set the december  discount rate assumption for our us pension plans at  which was a decrease from at december  we set the december  weighted average discount rate assumption for our non us pension plans at  which was an increase from at december  on a worldwide basis  the weighted average discount rate decreased to at december  from at december  our weighted average assumptions for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for the us pension plans and non us pension plans was and on a weighted average basis for all plans  respectively  at december  at december   the projected benefit obligation for all pension plans worldwide exceeded the value of plan assets by million 
this represents a million reduction in funded status from the million in the total unfunded projected benefit obligation reported in the projected benefit obligation exceeded the plan assets for the us pension plans by million and the us plans by million at december  the primary drivers behind the million reduction in funded status was the significant decline in the fair value of plan assets as a result of current conditions in the debt and equity markets and a decrease in the weighted average discount rate at december  we expect the pension expense to be approximately million compared to million in  which included a settlement loss of million 
the expected increase in pension expense in  excluding the impact of settlement losses  primarily is due to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses 
however  this increase in pension expense has been tempered by design changes in several of our international plans during a change in the rate of return of basis points would have the following effects on the estimated net periodic pension cost basis point in millions of dollars increase decrease us pension plans international pension plans all pension plans a change in the discount rate of basis points would have the following effects on the estimated net periodic pension cost basis point in millions of dollars increase decrease us pension plans international pension plans all pension plans 
table of contents determination of postretirement benefit cost annually  we review with our actuaries the key economic assumptions used in calculating postretirement benefit cost as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
postretirement benefits include health care and life insurance plans 
the determination of postretirement benefit cost is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including the assumed health care cost trend rates  the ultimate health care trend rate and the discount rate for determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
except for the us plans  the same discount rate selected for the pension plans generally is used to calculate the postretirement benefit obligation by country 
net non pension postretirement benefit cost credit was million in  million in and million in a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate of basis points would have had the following effects on postretirement benefit cost basis point in millions of dollars increase decrease us postretirement plans international postretirement plans all postretirement plans a change in the discount rate of basis points would have had the following effects on postretirement benefit cost basis point in millions of dollars increase decrease us postretirement plans international postretirement plans all postretirement plans accounting for business combinations we allocate the purchase price of business combinations to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair value at the date of acquisition pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  we consider information obtained during our due diligence process and utilize various valuation methods including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows 
we are required to make subjective estimates in connection with these valuations and allocations 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  business combinations 
refer to new accounting standards below for further discussion 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  including disposition  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets 
fair value generally is determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
in order to determine if an asset has been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable  independent  cash flows are available 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires us to make significant estimates and consider the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges of million associated with long lived assets primarily in our performance coatings product line as a result of the disposition of a textile compounding plant  the restructuring of production for certain products that will cease or be transferred to more 
table of contents efficient production facilities and the declining demand in textile applications 
the impairment charges represent the excess of carrying value of the asset groups over their fair value 
the fair value of the asset groups was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows attributable to the asset groups over their remaining useful life 
discontinued operations in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we report in discontinued operations the results of a component of our business that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
we classify a component of our business as held for sale if it meets the following criteria as of each balance sheet date we commit to a plan to sell the disposal group 
the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition  subject only to the terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups 
we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell 
we believe the sale of the disposal group is probable and expect the transfer to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year 
we actively market the disposal group for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value 
actions necessary to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
the results of operations of all entities that have been disposed of or are classified as held for sale have been classified in the loss from discontinued operations net of tax line item in the consolidated statement of operations for the cash flow statement is presented on a consolidated basis  including both continuing operations and discontinued operations for accounting for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
we assign goodwill to our reporting units that either is at the operating segment level or one level below our operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
we have determined that our lubrizol additives operating segment constitutes a reporting unit  and that our noveon consumer specialties product line  estane engineered polymers business  temprite engineered polymers business and performance coatings product line within our lubrizol advanced materials operating segment constitute separate reporting units 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is to be tested annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected october as the annual evaluation date to test for potential goodwill impairment 
we use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of after tax earnings  foreign currency exchange rates  expected capital expenditures and working capital requirements  which are based upon our long range plan 
our long range plan is updated each fall as part of our annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management and our board of directors 
a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit  and is added to the present value of the forecasted cash flows 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which a reporting unit s cash flow is projected to grow beyond the period covered by the long range plan 
lastly  we develop a weighted average cost of capital to discount the expected future cash flows 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise  with the weighting of returns based on the capitalization of comparable companies 
while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and weighted average cost of capital assumptions  actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances 

table of contents intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions  including customer lists  technology  trademarks  patents  land use rights  favorable lease arrangements and non compete agreements  are amortized on a straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
under sfas no 
 intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
we have elected october as the annual evaluation date to test for potential impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
a relief from royalty model is used to determine whether the fair value of an intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount 
the fair value of the intangible asset is determined as the present value of fees avoided by owning the respective trademark 
as part of the annual impairment test  the non amortized intangible assets are reviewed to determine if the indefinite status remains appropriate 
after performing our annual goodwill impairment test as of october   we determined million of goodwill associated with our performance coatings  estane and temprite reporting units was impaired as the carrying value of goodwill within these reporting units exceeded its fair value 
the impairment charge reflects the full impairment of the goodwill of the performance coatings reporting unit and is driven mainly by the reporting unit s weak current performance and updated outlook reflecting current economic conditions 
the impairment charge also includes the partial impairment of the goodwill of the estane and temprite reporting units and is driven mainly by the increase in our cost of capital in the fourth quarter of and to a lesser extent  a reduction in their near term earnings outlook 
at december   the remaining value of goodwill associated with our estane  temprite  noveon consumer specialties and lubrizol additives reporting units totaled million  million  million and million  respectively 
no goodwill remains within our performance coatings reporting unit at december  a decrease in the fair value of our estane reporting unit could indicate the potential for an additional impairment of its goodwill 
any further decrease in the fair value of our temprite reporting unit could indicate the potential for an additional impairment of its goodwill 
as a result of the discontinued use of the noveon trade name  we recognized an impairment charge in accordance with sfas no 
of million million after tax to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value in we reflected this charge in the fourth quarter of as we believed at that time we would more likely than not discontinue the use of the noveon trade name  except in the limited context of the consumer specialties product line 
asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an obligation to perform asset retirement obligations aros that legally are imposed 
fin no 
requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of an obligation to perform aros that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we have identified aros related to certain of our leased facilities and to asbestos remediation activities that may be required at other company owned facilities in the future 
we record liabilities for aros at the time that they are identified and when they can be reasonably estimated 
due to the long term  productive nature of some of our manufacturing operations  absent plans or expectation of plans to initiate asset retirement activities  we are unable to reasonably estimate the fair value of such asbestos remediation liabilities since the potential settlement dates cannot be determined at this time
