overview athenahealth is a leading provider of internet based business services for physician practices 
our service offerings are based on four integrated components our proprietary internet based software  our continually updated database of payer reimbursement process rules  our back office service operations that perform administrative aspects of billing and clinical data management for physician practices  and our automated and 
table of contents live patient communication services 
our principal offering  athenacollector  automates and manages billing related functions for physician practices and includes a medical practice management platform 
we have also developed a service offering  athenaclinicals  that automates and manages medical record related functions for physician practices and includes an electronic medical record  or emr  platform 
remindercall  the newest offering from athenahealth  is our automated appointment reminder system that allows patients to either confirm the appointment or request rescheduling  we plan on combining remindercall with test result  prescription refill  collection  and other patient communications offerings in our athenacommunicator services suite that we expect to beta launch in we refer to athenacollector as our revenue cycle management service  athenaclinicals as our clinical cycle management service  and athenacommunicator as our patient cycle management service 
our services are designed to help our clients achieve faster reimbursement from payers  reduce error rates  increase collections  lower operating costs  improve operational workflow controls  improve patient satisfaction and compliance  and more efficiently manage clinical and billing information 
in  we generated revenue of million from the sale of our services compared to million in given the scope of our market opportunity  we have increased our spending each year on growth  innovation  and infrastructure 
despite increased spending in these areas  higher revenue and lower direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue have led to greater net profits 
our revenues are predominately derived from business services that we provide on an ongoing basis 
this revenue is generally determined as a percentage of payments collected by our clients  so the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians working within our client accounts and the collections of these physicians 
to provide these services  we incur expense in several categories  including direct operating  selling and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization expense 
in general  our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases  whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients 
our other expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future  our overall business management activities  and our infrastructure 
as our revenues have grown  the difference between our revenue and our direct operating expense also has grown  which has afforded us the ability to spend more in other categories of expense and to experience an increase in operating margin 
we manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity  in adherence to related financial covenants 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue from two sources from business services associated with our revenue cycle and clinical cycle offerings and from implementation and other services 
implementation and other services consist primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services and for ongoing training and related support services 
business services accounted for approximately   and of our total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
business services fees are typically to of a practice s total collections depending upon the size  complexity  and other characteristics of the practice  plus a per statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients 
accordingly  business services fees are largely driven by the number of physician practices we serve  the number of physicians working in those physician practices  the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians  and our contracted rates 
there is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician offices 
typically  discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season  which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about to days later 
none of our clients accounted for more than of our total revenues for the years ended december    or operating expense direct operating expense 
direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  claim processing costs  other direct costs  and stock based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients  including staff who implement new clients 
although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future  the direct operating expense is expected to decline as a 
table of contents percentage of revenues as we further increase the percentage of transactions that are resolved on the first attempt 
in addition  over the longer term  we expect to increase our overall level of automation and to reduce our direct operating expense as a percentage of revenues as we become a larger operation  with higher volumes of work in particular functions  geographies  and medical specialties 
in and  we include in direct operating expense the service costs associated with our athenaclinicals offering  which includes transaction handling related to lab requisitions  lab results entry  fax classification  and other services 
we also expect these costs to increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future but to decline as a percentage of revenue 
this decrease will be driven by increased levels of automation and by economies of scale 
direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent  depreciation  and amortization  except for amortization related to purchased intangible assets 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs including trade shows  brand messaging  and on line initiatives and personnel related expense for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  commissions  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense 
although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered  we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence 
accordingly  we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients 
we also plan to expand our marketing activities in certain areas  such as attending trade shows  expanding user groups  and creating new printed materials 
as a result  we expect that  in the future  sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute terms but decline over time as a percentage of revenue 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses for research and development employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense and consulting fees for third party developers 
we expect that  in the future  research and development expense will increase in absolute terms but not as a percentage of revenue as new services and more mature products require incrementally less new research and development investment 
for our revenue cycle related application development  we expense nearly all of the development costs as we are at the operational stage of the development cycle 
for our clinical cycle related application development  we capitalized nearly all of our research and development costs during the years ended december  and  which capitalized costs represented approximately of our total research and development expenditures in and approximately in these capitalized expenditures began to amortize during the first quarter of when we began to implement our services to clients who are not part of our beta testing program 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expense for administrative employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense  occupancy and other indirect costs including building maintenance and utilities  and insurance  as well as software license fees  outside professional fees for accountants  lawyers  and consultants  and compensation for temporary employees 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth and incur additional expense related to being a publicly traded company 
though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms  we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of overall revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development costs  which we amortize over a two year period from the time of release of related software code 
because our core revenue cycle application is relatively mature  we expense those costs as incurred  and  as a result  in approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized 
in the year ended december   approximately were expensed rather than capitalized 
as we grow  we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business  and we will continue to develop software that 
table of contents we capitalize 
at the same time  because we are spreading fixed costs over a larger client base  we expect related depreciation and amortization expense to decline as a percentage of revenues over time 
other income expense 
interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our former working capital line of credit  our equipment related term leases  our term loan and revolving loans under our credit facility  and our former subordinated term loan  offset by interest income on investments 
interest income represents earnings from our cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the loss on interest rate derivative contract represents the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that is not designated a hedge under fas although this derivative has not been designated for hedge accounting  we believe that such instrument is correlated with the underlying cash flow exposure related to variability in interest rate movements on our term loan 
in  the loss on warrant liability represents the change in the fair value of our warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock at the end of each reporting period 
this warrant liability and associated accounting to recognize this liability at its fair value  ceased upon the completion of our initial public offering  at which time the associated liability converted to additional paid in capital 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies set forth below  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the client  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
all revenue  other than implementation revenue  is recognized when the service is performed 
relative to our business services offering that is based on the collections of amounts by our customers  we do not recognize revenue until our customers have been paid 
as the implementation service is not separable from the ongoing business services  we record implementation fees as deferred revenue until the implementation service is complete  at which time we recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the expected performance period 
our clients typically purchase one year contracts that renew automatically upon completion 
in most cases  our clients may terminate their agreements with days notice without cause 
we typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe 
our clients are billed monthly  in arrears  based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenanet  minimum fees  flat fees  or per claim fees where applicable 
invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the month and delivered to clients primarily by email 
for most of our clients  fees are then deducted from a pre defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto debit transaction 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue  as appropriate  and are included in our accounts receivable balances 
deposits received for future services such as implementation fees are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized over the term of the service agreement when ongoing services commence 

table of contents we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  and other economic information on both an historical and prospective basis 
customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
changes in the allowance during fiscal and were not material 
there is no off balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances 
software development costs we account for software development costs under the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
under sop  costs related to the preliminary project stage of subsequent versions of athenanet or other technology are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred in the application development stage are capitalized 
such costs are amortized over the software s estimated economic life of two years 
in  approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized  based upon the stage of development of the software 
in the year ended december   approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense is measured on the date of grant as the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock and the option exercise price  multiplied by the number of options granted 
generally  we grant stock options with exercise prices equal to or above the estimated fair value of our common stock 
no compensation expense was recorded for options issued to employees prior to january  on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the grant date fair value of employee stock options and other forms of share based awards 
sfas r addresses accounting for share based awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  and share based awards  with compensation expense measured using the fair value  for financial reporting purposes  and recorded over the requisite service period of the award 
in accordance with sfas r  we recognize compensation expense for awards granted and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
under sfas r  we estimate the fair value of stock options and share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
we have recorded stock based compensation under sfas r using the prospective transition method and  accordingly  will continue to account for awards granted prior to the adoption date of sfas r following the provisions of apb opinion no 
prior periods have not been restated 
for awards granted after january   we have recognized compensation expense for awards with service conditions on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for the twelve months ended december    and  we recorded million  million  and million in stock based compensation expense  respectively 
as of december   the future expense of non vested options of approximately million is to be recognized through the fair value of our options issued during the years ended december  and  was determined using the black scholes model with the following range of assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate expected dividend yield expected option term years expected stock volatility 
table of contents since we completed our initial public offering in september  we have not had sufficient history as a publicly traded company to evaluate its volatility factor and expected term 
as such  we analyzed the volatilities and expected terms of a group of peer companies to support the assumptions used in its calculations for the years ended december  and we averaged the volatilities of the peer companies with in the money options  sufficient trading history and similar vesting terms to generate the assumptions detailed above 
these companies include hlth corporation formerly known as emdeon corp  quality systems  inc  per se technologies  inc 
acquired by mckesson corp 
and allscripts healthcare solutions  inc now allscripts misys healthcare solutions  inc 
the expected volatility for options granted during was between and throughout the year 
the expected volatility for options granted during and was 
the expected life of options granted during the years ended december  and  was determined to be years using the simplified method as prescribed by sab no 
 share based payment 
the risk free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires companies to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period 
we believe that there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods than those currently applied under sfas r  the compensation expense that we record in the future under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have historically reported for future grants 
for example  if the volatility percentage used in calculating our sfas r stock compensation expense had fluctuated by  the total stock compensation expense to be recognized over the stock options four year vesting period would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
if the forfeiture rate used in calculating our sfas r stock compensation expense had fluctuated by  the total stock compensation expense to be recognized over the stock options four year vesting period would have decreased or increased by approximately million 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we are subject to federal and various state income taxes in the united states  and we use significant judgment and estimates in determining our provision and related deferred tax assets 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
we consider whether a valuation allowance is needed on its deferred tax assets by evaluating all positive and negative evidence relative to its ability to recover deferred tax assets  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we begin with historical results  adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and changes in accounting policies  if any  and incorporate assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies  if any 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative pre tax income loss 
prior to the year ended december   we had incurred losses and it was difficult to assert that deferred tax assets were recoverable with this negative evidence 
during the fourth quarter of  our results of operations generated a cumulative profit as measured over the current and prior two years 
in addition  we have been profitable for 
table of contents six consecutive quarters 
based on consideration of the weight of positive and negative evidence  including forecasted operating results  we concluded that there was sufficient positive evidence that its deferred tax assets are more likely than not recoverable as of december  accordingly  the remaining valuation allowance of million was reversed as of december  as of december   we had federal and state nols of approximately  and  respectively  to offset future federal and state taxable income 
the state nols begin to expire and the federal nols expire at various times from through during the year ended december   we utilized tax net operating loss carryforwards to reduce the current tax provision by  we have generated nols from stock compensation deductions in excess of expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes excess tax benefits 
excess tax benefits are realized when they reduce taxes payable  as determined using a with and without method  and are credited to additional paid in capital and not as a reduction of income tax provision 
during the year ended december   the company realized excess tax benefits from state tax deductions of  which was credited to additional paid in capital 
as of december   the amount of unrecognized excess tax benefits is  which will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
we classify our deferred tax assets and liabilities as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability for financial reporting giving rise to the temporary difference 
a deferred tax asset that is not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting  including deferred tax assets related to nols  is classified according to the expected reversal date 
we have classified million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nol as current deferred tax assets at december  in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this statement clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company s financial statements 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
this interpretation also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted fin effective january  on january   we adopted fin and reduced deferred tax assets for unrecognized tax benefits totaling because of the company s net loss position and full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets  the adoption of fin had no impact on our balance sheet or accumulated deficit upon implementation 
our policy is to record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
as of december   we have no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
tax returns for all years are open for audit by the internal revenue service irs until we begin utilizing its net operating losses as the irs has the ability to adjust the amount of a net operating loss utilized on an income tax return 
our primary state jurisdiction for tax purposes is the commonwealth of massachusetts 
goodwill goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill annually in our fourth quarter based on a single reporting unit 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify 
table of contents potential impairment  compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill as of the date of impairment review 
the implied fair value of our reporting unit goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value of our reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the test for impairment requires management to make several estimates about fair value  principally related to the determination that we operate as a single unit and therefore that fair value is based on our market capitalization 
management estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our combined consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
purchased intangible assets other intangible assets consist of technology and customer relationships acquired in connection with a business acquisition and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we have estimated the useful life of the technology acquired from medicalmessaging to be five years and the customer relationships to be ten years

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  from depreciation and amortization of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of property and equipment during other income expense 
interest income for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million from interest income of million for the year ended december  the increase was directly related to the higher cash and short term investments balance during the year 
interest expense for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of million over interest expense of million for the year ended december  the decrease is related to a decrease in bank debt during the loss on interest rate derivative for the year ended december   was million  which was the result of the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that was not designated a hedge under fas although this derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that the instrument is closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings 
the loss on warrant liability for the year ended december   was million  which was the result of the change in the fair value of the warrants prior to our initial public offering ipo 
this change in the fair value of the warrants is attributable to the appreciation in the fair value of our common and preferred stock during this period  as the common stock increased from per share as of december   to per share at the time of our ipo 
these warrants converted to warrants to purchase shares of common stock upon the consummation of our ipo  at which time the existing liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of million  or  from depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the lower amortization amount relating to our capitalized software development costs  which is the result of previously capitalized costs becoming fully amortized during other income expense 
interest income for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million from interest income of million for the year ended december  the increase was directly related to the higher cash balance during the year 
interest expense for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  over interest expense of million for the year ended december  the increase is related to an increase in bank debt  a working capital line of credit  and an equipment line of credit during and penalties for the earlier repayment of debt during the loss on warrant liability for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million from million for the year ended december   as a result of the change in the fair value of the warrants 
this change in the fair value of the warrants is attributable to the appreciation in the fair value of our common and preferred stock during this period  as the common stock increased from per share as of december   to per share at the time of our ipo on september  these warrants converted to warrants to purchase shares of common stock upon the consummation of our ipo  at which time the existing liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital

accordingly  the results include the reversal of a million valuation allowance 
during these periods  total revenue increased each quarter  primarily due to the expansion of our client base and growth in revenue collections made on behalf of our existing clients 
our direct operating expense 
table of contents and selling and marketing expense also increased each quarter  primarily due to an increase in salary and benefit expense as we expanded our operations to serve and sell to our increasing client base 
research and development expense increased in each quarter during this period  primarily due to our development of athenaclinicals and other product and business development initiatives  as well as the expansion of athenahealth technology private limited 
general and administrative expense fluctuated during this period  with an overall upward trend  primarily as a result of our hiring additional personnel in connection with our anticipated growth and incurred expenses in preparation for becoming a public company 
we have experienced consistent revenue growth over the past several years  which is primarily the result of a steady increase in the number of physicians and other medical providers served by us 
this sequential revenue increase is driven by the implementation of new accounts and the retention of existing accounts 
because we earn ongoing fees  a large percentage of each quarter s revenue comes from accounts that also contributed to the revenues of the preceding quarter 
the vast majority of our clients pay for services as a percentage of collections posted  therefore our revenue is highly correlated to the underlying collections of our clients 
the provision of medical services by our clients takes place throughout the year  but there are seasonal factors that affect the total volume of patients seen by our clients  which in turn impacts the collections per physician and our related revenues per physician 
in particular  for patient visits that are discretionary or elective  we typically see a reduction of office visits during the late summer and during the end of year holiday season  which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients of about to days later 
therefore  the negative impact on client collections and related company revenues per physician is generally experienced in the first and third calendar quarters of the year 
in our experience  client collections and related company revenues per physician are seasonally stronger in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have funded our growth primarily through the private sale of equity securities  totaling approximately million  as well as through long term debt  working capital  equipment financing loans  and the completion of our initial public offering  which provided net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling million and investments of million 
our total indebtedness was million at december   and was comprised of equipment leases and amounts borrowed under our credit facility with bank of america  na looking forward to  we anticipate sufficient liquidity from cash flows and access to existing credit facilities to meet our operational needs and financial obligations 
our liquidity derived from cash flows is  to a large degree  predicated on our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner and the cost of operating our business 
cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december   was million and consisted of a net income of million and million utilized by working capital and other activities 
this is offset by positive non cash adjustments of million related to depreciation and amortization expense  million in non cash stock compensation expense  million of non cash rent expense  a million from a non cash loss on interest rate swap  and million for a provision for uncollectible accounts 
negative non cash adjustments relate to amortization of discounts on investments for million and million increase in deferred provision 
cash used by working capital and other activities was primarily attributable to a million increase in accrued expense  a million decrease in deferred rent  a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and a million increase in other long term assets  offset in part by a million increase in deferred revenue and a million increase in accounts payables 
these changes were attributable to growth in the size of our business and in the related direct operating expense

net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   which consisted of purchases of investments of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  and expenditures for internal development of the athenaclinicals application of million 
this outgoing investment cash flow was offset by positive investment cash flow of million from proceeds of the sales and maturities of investments and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  the majority of the cash provided in the period resulted from proceeds from long term debt and capital lease obligations of million  million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and a tax benefit from stock based awards of million 
this was offset by payments on long term debt of million and million of deferred financing fees 
the million of debt was either issued as fixed interest rate debt or has been effectively converted to fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps that change floating rates to fixed rates 
the weighted average interest rate on fixed rate long term debt is  including the effects of the interest rate swaps 
the current fair value of the swap is a liability of million

we make investments in property and equipment and in software development on an ongoing basis 
our property and equipment investments consist primarily of technology infrastructure to provide capacity for expansion of our client base  including computers and related equipment in our data centers and infrastructure in our service operations 
our software development investments consist primarily of company managed design  development  testing  and deployment of new application functionality 
because the practice management component of athenanet is considered mature  we expense nearly all software maintenance costs for this component of our platform as incurred 
for the electronic medical records emr component of athenanet  which is the platform for our athenaclinicals offering  we capitalize nearly all software development 
in the year ended december   we capitalized million in property and equipment and million in software development 
in the year ended december   we capitalized million of property and equipment and million of software development 
included in the capitalized property and equipment is a complex of buildings totaling  square feet  including approximately  square feet of office space  on approximately acres of land located in belfast  maine  for a total price of million 
we currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of approximately million over the next twelve months 
given our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  and funds available under our existing revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our business and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next twelve 
table of contents months 
we may increase our capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in infrastructure and personnel and as we expand our national presence 
in addition  we may pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies or experience unexpected operating losses  in which case we may need to raise additional funds sooner than expected 
accordingly  we may need to engage in private or public equity or debt financings to secure additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences  and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain required financing on terms satisfactory to us  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
beyond the twelve month period  we intend to maintain sufficient liquidity through continued improvements in the size and profitability of our business and through prudent management of our cash resources and our credit arrangements

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements subsequent to initial recognition 
prior to the issuance of sfas  which emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement and not an entity specific measurement  there were different definitions of fair value and limited definitions for applying those definitions under generally accepted accounting principles 
effective january   we adopted sfas on a prospective basis 
in accordance with the provisions of fsp no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 we have elected to defer implementation of sfas as it relates to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until january  we are evaluating the impact  if any  this standard will have on our non financial assets and liabilities 
accordingly  our adoption of this standard on january   is limited to financial assets and liabilities 
the initial adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
entities that elect the fair value option will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value may be elected on an instrument by instrument basis  with limited exceptions 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar assets and liabilities 
sfas was effective beginning after january  we did not designate any financial assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value on january   or subsequently 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the effect that the application of sfas r may have a material impact on our financial statements if an acquisition occurs  but the impact will depend upon whether an acquisition is made and will be determined at that time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes to a parent s ownership interest  and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas and have not yet determined the impact  if any  of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements 
we do not have any non controlling interest in our consolidated subsidiaries 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which requires additional financial statement disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
sfas requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable financial statement users to understand how and why a 
table of contents company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal because sfas only requires additional disclosure  the adoption will not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued eitf  determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions 
it also clarifies the impact of foreign currency denominated strike prices and market based employee stock option valuation instruments on the evaluation 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are assessing the impact of eitf on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the indian rupee 
none of our consolidated revenues are generated outside the united states 
none of our vendor relationships  including our contract with our offshore service provider  visionprocess business solutions inc  for work performed in india or the philippines  is denominated in any currency other than the us dollar 
in and  and  respectively  of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in chennai  india  and were incurred in indian rupees 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  these amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in deposits  money market funds  and short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the value of these securities  however  will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise 
interest rate risk as of december   we had long term debt and capital lease obligations totaling million  which have both variable and fixed interest rate components 
we have entered into an interest rate swap intended to mitigate variability in interest rate movements on our term loan 
the swap has an amortizing notional amount over the swap agreement 
for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the table below summarizes the principal terms of our interest rate swap transaction  including the notional amount of the swap  the interest rate payment we receive from and pay to our swap counterparty  the term of the transaction  and its fair market value at december  initial fair value at notional fiscal year maturity december  description underlying amount receive pay entered into fiscal year interest rate swap variable to fixed interest on term loan  libor plus fixed
