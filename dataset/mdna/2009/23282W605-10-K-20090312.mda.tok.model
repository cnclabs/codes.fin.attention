item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics that modulate muscle function for the potential treatment of serious diseases and medical conditions 
our research and development activities are founded on our knowledge and expertise regarding the cytoskeleton  a complex biological infrastructure that plays a fundamental role within every human cell 
these activities initially focused on inhibitors of cell division  and are now directed to the biology of muscle function  and in particular  to small molecule modulators of the contractility of cardiac  smooth and skeletal muscle 
we intend to leverage our experience in muscle contractility in order to expand our current pipeline into new therapeutic areas  and expect to continue to be able to identify additional potential drug candidates that may be suitable for clinical development 
we have four drug candidates currently in human clinical trials ck is in phase iia clinical trials for the potential treatment of heart failure  ispinesib is the subject of a phase i ii clinical trial in breast cancer patients  sb is the subject of a phase i ii clinical trial in patients with hodgkin or non hodgkin lymphoma  and gsk is the subject of phase i clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors 
we also have three potential drug candidates currently in preclinical development ck  a skeletal sarcomere activator which may be developed for diseases or medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting  a back up development compound for ck  and an inhibitor of smooth muscle myosin intended for inhaled delivery that may be useful as a potential treatment of diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension  asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
muscle contractility programs cardiac muscle contractility our lead drug candidate  ck  a novel cardiac muscle myosin activator for the potential treatment of heart failure  is currently in phase iia clinical development to evaluate the safety  tolerability  pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic profile of this drug candidate in both an intravenous and oral formulation 
in december  we announced top line results from a phase iia clinical trial evaluating the safety of ck in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and angina 
the primary safety endpoint was defined as stopping an exercise test during double blind treatment with ck or placebo due to unacceptable angina at an earlier exercise stage than at baseline 
this endpoint was observed in one patient receiving placebo and did not occur in any patient receiving ck we anticipate presenting final data from this clinical trial in 
table of contents at the november scientific sessions of the american heart association  we reported interim results from a phase iia clinical trial evaluating ck administered intravenously to patients with stable heart failure 
the interim results showed that ck demonstrated statistically significant increases in systolic ejection time and fractional shortening at plasma concentrations greater than ng ml and statistically significant increases in stroke volume at plasma concentrations greater than ng ml 
there were also statistically significant increases in ejection fraction at ck plasma concentrations greater than ng ml when ejection fraction was calculated by a hybrid method in which stroke volume  measured using doppler technology  was divided by the left ventricular end diastolic volume  measured using two dimensional echocardiography 
in addition  these data demonstrated statistically significant correlations between increasing ck plasma concentration and increases in systolic ejection time  stroke volume  fractional shortening  ejection fraction and cardiac output 
the results also showed statistically significant correlations between increasing ck concentrations and decreases in supine and standing heart rate and left ventricular end systolic volume 
this trial was planned to consist of cohorts 
we recently completed treatment of cohort of this trial 
we anticipate presenting final data from this clinical trial at the annual meeting of the american college of cardiology in march we are continuing to conduct an open label  non randomized phase iia clinical trial designed to evaluate an intravenous formulation of ck administered to patients with stable heart failure undergoing clinically indicated coronary angiography 
in addition  we have conducted five phase i clinical trials of ck in healthy subjects a first time in humans study evaluating an intravenous formulation  an oral bioavailability study evaluating both intravenous and oral formulations  and three studies of oral formulations a drug drug interaction study  a dose proportionality study and a study evaluating modified release formulations 
we believe the safety data from our phase iia clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of ck in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and angina  together with the improvements in systolic function observed in our phase iia clinical trial evaluating ck in stable heart failure patients  support the progression of ck into phase iib clinical development 
in mid  we anticipate the initiation of a phase iib clinical trial of ck in chronic heart failure outpatients at increased risk for death and hospitalization 
in the second quarter of  we anticipate initiating an additional phase iia clinical trial designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of both a modified release and an immediate release formulation of ck in patients with heart failure 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with amgen inc to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics that activate cardiac muscle contractility for potential applications in the treatment of heart failure  including ck the agreement provides amgen with a non exclusive license and access to certain technology 
the agreement also granted amgen an option to obtain an exclusive license world wide  except japan  to develop and commercialize ck and other drug candidates arising from the collaboration 
amgen s option is exercisable during a defined period  the ending of which is dependent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  primarily our delivery of certain phase i and phase iia clinical trials data for ck in accordance with an agreed development plan  the results of which may reasonably support its progression into phase iib clinical development 
in february  we announced that we believe we completed delivery of this data to amgen 
prior to the exercise or expiration of amgen s option  we are responsible for conducting all development activities for ck  at our own expense 
to exercise its option  amgen would pay an exercise fee of million and thereafter would be responsible for the development and commercialization of ck and related compounds  at its expense  subject to cytokinetics development and commercialization participation rights 
following exercise of the option  the agreement provides for potential pre commercialization and commercialization milestone payments of up to million in the aggregate on ck and other potential products arising from research under the collaboration  and royalties that escalate based on increasing levels of annual net sales of products commercialized under the agreement 
the agreement also provides for us to receive increased royalties by co funding phase iii development costs of drug candidates under the collaboration 
if we elect to co fund such costs  we would be entitled to co promote ck in north america and participate in agreed commercialization activities in institutional care settings  at amgen s expense 
if amgen elects not to exercise its option to ck  we may then independently proceed to develop and commercialize ck  ourselves or with another partner 

table of contents the clinical trials program for ck may proceed for several years  and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from this drug candidate until the program is successfully completed  regulatory approval is achieved  and a drug is commercialized 
ck is at too early a stage of development for us to predict when or if this may occur 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program will increase significantly as we advance ck through clinical development 
our expenditures will also increase if amgen does not exercise its option and we elect to develop ck or related compounds independently  or if we elect to co fund later stage development of ck or other compounds in our cardiac muscle contractility program under our collaboration and option agreement with amgen following amgen s exercise of its option 
skeletal muscle contractility in april  we announced that we had selected ck as the lead potential drug candidate from this program 
we expect to submit an investigational new drug application ind with the us food and drug administration fda to initiate a phase i clinical trial of ck in healthy volunteers in in january  we announced that we had selected another compound from this program as a backup development compound to ck ck and its backup development compound are structurally distinct small molecule activators of the skeletal sarcomere 
these potential drug candidates act on the troponin regulatory complex of the skeletal sarcomere 
activation of the troponin complex increases its sensitivity to calcium  leading to an increase in skeletal muscle contractility 
this mechanism of action has demonstrated encouraging pharmacological activity in preclinical models 
we are evaluating the potential indications for which ck may be useful 
these may include diseases and medical conditions associated with skeletal muscle weakness or wasting  such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  also known as als or lou gehrig s disease  cachexia in connection with heart failure or cancer  sarcopenia and general frailty associated with aging 
ck is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from its commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our skeletal muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our skeletal muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance ck  its back up compound or other compounds from this program through clinical development 
smooth muscle contractility in january  we announced that we had selected a lead potential drug candidate from this program for advancement 
this compound is a small molecule direct inhibitor of smooth muscle myosin 
by inhibiting the function of the myosin motor central to the contraction of smooth muscle  this small molecule directly leads to the relaxation of contracted smooth muscle 
specifically intended for inhaled delivery applications  this potential drug candidate has demonstrated encouraging pharmacological activity in preclinical models as a novel mechanism vasodilator and bronchodilator 
this data suggests that it may be useful as a potential treatment of diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension  asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
this potential drug candidate is currently in ind enabling studies 
this potential drug candidate is at too early a stage of development for us to predict if or when we will be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from its commercialization 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with this program 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our smooth muscle contractility program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that our expenditures relating to the research and development of compounds in our smooth muscle contractility program will increase significantly if and as we advance this smooth muscle myosin inhibitor or other compounds from this program through clinical development 

table of contents oncology program mitotic kinesin inhibitors we currently have three drug candidates in clinical trials for the potential treatment of cancer ispinesib  sb and gsk all of these arose from our earlier research activities directed to the role of the cytoskeleton in cell division and have been progressed under our strategic alliance with gsk 
this strategic alliance was established in to discover  develop and commercialize novel small molecule therapeutics targeting mitotic kinesins for applications in the treatment of cancer and other diseases 
mitotic kinesins are a family of cytoskeletal motor proteins involved in the process of cell division  or mitosis 
under that strategic alliance  we have focused primarily on two mitotic kinesins kinesin spindle protein ksp and centromere associated protein e cenp e 
in november  we amended the agreement and assumed responsibility  at our expense  for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins  other than cenp e 
gsk retained an option to resume responsibility for the development and commercialization of either or both of ispinesib and sb this option expired at the end of accordingly  we retain all rights to both ispinesib and sb  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
in each of june  and  we amended the agreement to extend the research term of the gsk strategic alliance for an additional year to continue joint translational research directed to cenp e 
ispinesib under our strategic alliance  gsk  in collaboration with the national cancer institute  conducted a broad phase ii clinical trials program designed to evaluate ispinesib across multiple tumor types 
to date  we believe some clinical activity for ispinesib has been observed in non small cell lung  ovarian and breast cancers  with the most clinical activity observed in a phase ii clinical trial evaluating ispinesib in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had failed treatment with taxanes and anthracyclines 
in addition  preclinical and phase ib clinical data relating to ispinesib indicate that it may have an additive effect when combined with certain existing chemotherapeutic agents 
as a result of gsk s option expiring  we have retained all development and commercialization rights to ispinesib 
we are conducting a phase i ii clinical trial for ispinesib to further define its clinical activity profile in chemotherapy na ve locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients 
this clinical trial is using a more dose dense schedule than was previously evaluated to determine if the overall response to ispinesib can be increased while maintaining its existing safety profile 
we intend to complete the phase i portion of this trial and to seek a strategic partner for the future development and commercialization of ispinesib 
sb sb was studied by gsk in a dose escalating phase i clinical trial evaluating its safety  tolerability and pharmacokinetics in advanced cancer patients when administered intravenously on a once every day schedule 
the observed toxicities at the recommended phase ii dose were manageable 
as a result of gsk s option expiring  we have retained all development and commercialization rights to sb we are conducting a phase i ii clinical trial evaluating sb in patients with hodgkin and non hodgkin lymphoma on a more dose dense schedule than was previously evaluated 
we intend to complete the phase i portion of this trial and to seek a strategic partner for the future development and commercialization of sb gsk under our strategic alliance  gsk is responsible  at its expense  for the development of and commercialization of gsk gsk is currently conducting a first time in humans phase i clinical trial of gsk in patients with advanced  refractory solid tumors 
we anticipate that gsk will initiate a phase ii clinical trial of gsk in we will receive royalties from gsk s sales of any drugs developed under the strategic alliance 
for those drug candidates that gsk develops under the strategic alliance  we can elect to co fund certain later stage development activities which would increase our potential royalty rates on sales of resulting drugs and provide us with the option to secure co promotion rights in north america 
if we elect to co fund later stage development  we expect that the royalties to be paid on future sales of gsk could potentially increase based on increasing product sales and our anticipated level of co funding 
if we exercise our co promotion option  then we 
table of contents are entitled to receive reimbursement from gsk for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercialization activities 
the clinical trials program for each of ispinesib  sb and gsk may proceed for several years  and we will not be in a position to generate any revenues or material net cash flows from any of these drug candidates until its clinical trials program is successfully completed  regulatory approval is achieved and a drug is commercialized 
each of these drug candidates is at too early a stage of development for us to predict when or if this may occur 
we currently fund all research and development costs associated with ispinesib and sb if we continue to conduct our phase i ii clinical trials for either or both of ispinesib and sb  our expenditures relating to research and development of these drug candidate will increase significantly 
we recorded research and development expenses for activities relating to our mitotic kinesins oncology program of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we received and recognized as revenue reimbursements from gsk of fte and other expenses related to our mitotic kinesins oncology program of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  development risks the successful development of any of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing and costs of the activities necessary to complete the development of any of our drug candidates or the date of completion of these development activities due to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the uncertainty of the timing of the initiation and completion of patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical trials  the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing of the analyses of our clinical trial data after these trials have been initiated and completed  our potential inability to obtain additional funding and resources for our development activities on acceptable terms  if at all  including  but not limited to  our potential inability to obtain or retain partners to assist in the design  management  conduct and funding of clinical trials  delays or additional costs in manufacturing of our drug candidates for clinical trial use  including developing appropriate formulations of our drug candidates  the uncertainty of clinical trial results  the uncertainty of obtaining fda or other foreign regulatory agency approval required for the clinical investigation of our drug candidates  the uncertainty related to the development of commercial scale manufacturing processes and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing facility  and possible delays in the characterization  synthesis or optimization of potential drug candidates 
if we fail to complete the development of any of our drug candidates in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us or our partners to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our programs on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are discussed further in the risk factors entitled we have never generated  and may never generate  revenues from commercial sales of our drugs and we may not have drugs to market for at least several years  if ever  clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the desired safety and efficacy of our drug candidates  which could prevent or significantly delay completion of clinical development and regulatory approval and clinical trials are expensive  time consuming and subject to delay  and other risk factors 

table of contents revenues our current revenue sources are limited  and we do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales for several years  if at all 
we have recognized revenues from our strategic alliances with amgen and gsk for license fees and contract research activities 
under our collaboration and option agreement with amgen  we received an upfront  non refundable license and technology access fee of million 
in connection with entering into the agreement  we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement with amgen 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock to amgen for net proceeds of million  of which the million purchase premium was recorded as deferred revenue 
we are amortizing the upfront fee and stock premium to license revenue ratably over the maximum term of the non exclusive license  which is four years 
we may receive additional payments from amgen upon achieving certain precommercialization and commercialization milestones 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we may also be eligible to receive reimbursement for contract development activities subsequent to amgen s option exercise  which we will record as revenue if and when the related expenses are incurred 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
revenues from gsk in were based on negotiated rates intended to approximate the costs for our full time employee equivalents ftes performing research under the strategic alliance and our out of pocket expenses  which we recorded as the related expenses were incurred 
gsk paid us an upfront licensing fee  which we recognized ratably over the strategic alliance s initial five year research term  which ended in june in  we received a million milestone payment from gsk relating to its initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk we may receive additional payments from gsk upon achieving certain precommercialization milestones 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
we record amounts received in advance of performance as deferred revenue 
the revenues recognized to date are non refundable  even if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in december  gsk s option to license ispinesib and sb expired and all rights to these drug candidates remain with us under the collaboration and license agreement  subject to our royalty obligations to gsk 
gsk continues to conduct the development of gsk under the agreement 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and other precommercialization milestones under our strategic alliances with gsk and  if amgen exercises its option  amgen  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year 
we expect that our future revenues will most likely be derived from royalties on sales from drugs licensed to gsk or amgen under our strategic alliances and from those licensed to future partners  and from direct sales of our drugs 
if amgen exercises its option  we will retain a product by product option to co fund certain later stage development activities under our strategic alliance with amgen  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
for those products being developed by gsk under our strategic alliance  we also retain a product by product option to co fund certain later stage development activities  thereby potentially increasing our royalties and affording us co promotion rights in north america 
if we exercise our co promotion rights under either strategic alliance  we are entitled to receive reimbursement for certain sales force costs we incur in support of our commercial activities 
research and development we incur research and development expenses associated with both partnered and unpartnered research activities 
research and development expenses related to our strategic alliance with gsk consisted primarily of costs related to research and screening  lead optimization and other activities relating to the identification of compounds for development as mitotic kinesin inhibitors for the treatment of cancer 
prior to june  certain of these costs were reimbursed by gsk on an fte basis 
from through november  gsk funded the majority of the costs related to the clinical development of ispinesib and sb under our amended 
table of contents collaboration and license agreement with gsk  we assumed responsibility for the continued research  development and commercialization of inhibitors of ksp  including ispinesib and sb  and other mitotic kinesins other than cenp e  at our sole expense 
we also have the option to co fund certain later stage development activities for gsk our conduct of the development of ispinesib and sb and the potential exercise of our co funding option for gsk would result in a significant increase in research and development expenses 
we expect to incur research and development expenses in the continued conduct of preclinical studies and clinical trials for ck for the potential treatment of heart failure  ck and other skeletal sarcomere activators for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting  our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor potential drug candidate and other smooth muscle myosin inhibitor compounds for the potential treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and diseases and medical conditions associated with bronchoconstriction  ispinesib for the potential treatment of breast cancer  sb for the potential treatment of hodgkin and non hodgkin lymphoma  and in connection with our research programs in other disease areas 
research and development expenses related to any development and commercialization activities we elect to fund would consist primarily of employee compensation  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and contract research  facilities costs and depreciation of equipment 
from our inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million for research and development activities relating to our cardiac muscle contractility program  million for our skeletal muscle contractility program  million for our smooth muscle contractility program  million for our mitotic kinesin inhibitors  million for our proprietary technologies and million for other research programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions  including  but not limited to  finance  human resources  legal  business and commercial development and strategic planning 
other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents and regulatory compliance 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in restructuring in september  we announced a restructuring plan to realign our workforce and operations in line with a strategic reassessment of our research and development activities and corporate objectives 
as a result  we have focused our research activities to our muscle contractility programs while continuing our ongoing clinical trials in heart failure and cancer and have discontinued early research activities directed to oncology 
to implement this plan  we reduced our workforce by approximately  or employees  to employees 
the affected employees were provided with severance payments and outplacement assistance 
we have completed substantially all restructuring activities and recognized all anticipated restructuring charges 
all severance payments were made as of december  we expect to record only immaterial charges to the accrued restructuring costs during  primarily related to employee benefits and outplacement services 
as a result of the restructuring plan  in  we recorded total restructuring charges of million for employee severance and benefit related costs and a million charge related to the impairment of lab equipment that is held for sale 
we expect to sell the held for sale equipment by september 
table of contents stock compensation the following table summarizes stock based compensation related to employee stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases for  and  which was allocated as follows in thousands years ended december  research and development general and administrative stock based compensation included in operating expenses as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options compensation arrangements granted under our stock plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards as of december  was million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in addition  through  we continued to amortize deferred stock based compensation recorded prior to adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  for stock options granted prior to the initial public offering 
the remaining balance became fully amortized in the fourth quarter of and the balance of deferred stock based compensation was zero at december  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which is the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we have not recorded an income tax provision in the years ended december   and because we had a net taxable loss in each of those periods 
given that we have a history of recurring losses  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  if not utilized  the federal and state operating loss carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning and  respectively 
due to california state s temporary suspension of net operating losses in and  the state carryover period will be extended by two additional years for an net operating losses sustained in pre tax years 
the net operating loss carryforwards include deductions for stock options 
when utilized  the portion related to stock options deductions will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision 
we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively  at december  if not utilized  the federal carryforwards will expire in various amounts beginning in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where equity transactions resulted in a change of ownership as defined by internal revenue code section during the year ended december   we conducted a study and determined that our use of our federal research credit is subject to such a restriction 
accordingly  we reduced our deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance by million 
as a result  the research credit amount as of december  reflects the restriction on our ability to use the credit 
on january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas fin 
the new standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit  in 
table of contents our judgment  which is greater than likely to be realized 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin on january  resulted in no fin liability on the balance sheet 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was million 
we are currently not subject to income tax examinations 
in general  the statute of limitations for tax liabilities for these years remains open for purpose of adjusting the amounts of the losses and credits carried forward from those years 
interest and penalties were zero for we account for interest and penalties by classifying both as income tax expense in the financial statements 
because we have recorded a full valuation allowance on all our deferred tax assets  fin has had no impact on our effective tax rate 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change materially over the next months 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues years ended december  increase decrease in millions research and development revenues from related party license revenues from related parties total revenues we recorded total revenues of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development revenues from related party refers to revenues from our partner gsk  which is also a stockholder of cytokinetics 
research and development revenues from gsk of million in consisted of patent expense reimbursements 
research and development revenues from gsk of million in consisted of a milestone payment for gsk s initiation of a phase i clinical trial of gsk in patients with solid tumors  and patent expense reimbursements of million 
research and development revenues from gsk of million in consisted of million for the reimbursement of ftes and approximately million for patent expense reimbursements 
fte reimbursements from gsk terminated in june due to the conclusion of the initial five year research term under the gsk agreement for all mitotic kinesins except cenp e 
the fte sponsorship was determined annually by gsk and us in accordance with the annual research plan and contractually predefined fte support levels 
in each of june   and  the research term of our strategic alliance with gsk was extended for an additional year under an updated research plan focused only on cenp e without corresponding fte reimbursement 
in december  gsk s option to license each of ispinesib and sb as provided under the parties collaboration and license agreement expired 
accordingly  we retain all rights to both ispinesib and sb  subject to certain royalty obligations to gsk 
license revenues from related parties represents license revenue from our strategic alliances with amgen and gsk 
license revenue from amgen was million in  million in and million in  and represented recognition of the upfront license fee and the premium paid on the common stock purchase by amgen 
as of december   our remaining balance of amgen deferred revenue was million 
we are amortizing the amgen deferred revenue on a straight line basis over the maximum term of the non exclusive license granted to amgen under the collaboration and option agreement  which is four years 
license revenue from gsk was zero in each of and and million in the license revenue from gsk was amortized on a straight line basis over the agreement s initial research term  which ended in june

we recorded these reimbursements as related party revenue 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total completion costs vary significantly for each drug candidate and are difficult to estimate 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which early research programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with applicable regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain and maintain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we expect our research and development expenditures to decrease in  as a result of our restructuring in september we expect to continue development of our drug candidate ck for the potential treatment of heart failure and our potential drug candidates ck for the potential treatment of diseases and medical conditions associated with muscle weakness or wasting  and our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor for the potential treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and diseases and medical conditions associated with 
table of contents bronchoconstriction  and our phase i clinical development of our drug candidates ispinesib and sb for the potential treatment of cancer

auction rate securities ars 
our long term investments at december  included at par value million of ars 
these ars were intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
as of december   there were no ars in an unrealized loss position  and there were no failed auctions associated with our ars through that date 
our ars with auction reset dates prior to february  had successful auctions at which their interest rates were reset 
in february  we liquidated million of our ars at par  which were classified as short term investments as of december  with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  these ars have experienced multiple failed auctions since february  as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
as a result  these affected securities are currently not liquid 
all of our ars are secured by student loans 
up to approximately of the value of these student loans are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government 
additionally  all of our ars had the highest credit rating of aaa as of december  in february  the rating of certain of our ars with million in par value was reduced to a all of these securities continue to pay interest according to their stated terms generally basis points over the ninety one day us treasury bill rate with interest rates resetting every days 
these ars are scheduled to ultimately mature between and  although we do not intend to hold them until maturity 
the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
the fair value of these ars were estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of december  the significant assumptions of this valuation model were discount margins ranging from to basis points which are based on industry recognized student loan sector indices  an additional liquidity discount of approximately basis points and an estimated term to liquidity of to years 
other items this analysis considers are the collateralization underlying the ars  the creditworthiness of the counterparty  and the timing of expected future cash flows 
these ars were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics as the securities held by us 
although the ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  based on valuation models of the individual securities  we have recognized in the statement of operations an unrecognized loss of approximately million in interest and other  net for ars for which we have concluded that an other than temporary impairment exists 
the fair value in long term investments for these ars at december  was estimated million 
in connection with the failed auctions of our ars  which were marketed and sold by ubs ag and its affiliates  in october  we accepted a settlement with ubs ag pursuant to which ubs ag has issued to us series c auction rate securities rights the ars rights 
the ars rights provide us the right to receive the par value of our ars  ie  the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid interest 
pursuant to the ars rights  we may require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time between june  and july  in addition  ubs or its affiliates may sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of the ars at its discretion at any time prior to expiration of the ars rights  subject to the obligation to pay us the par value of such ars 
the ars rights are not transferable  tradable or marginable  and will not be listed or quoted on any securities exchange or any electronic communications network 
as consideration for ars rights  we agreed to release ubs ag  ubs securities llc and ubs financial services  inc  and or their affiliates  directors  and officers from any claims 
table of contents directly or indirectly relating to the marketing and sale of the ars  other than for consequential damages 
ubs s obligations in connection with the ars rights are not secured by its assets and ubs is not required to obtain any financing to support these obligations 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations in connection with the ars rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
the ars rights represent a firm agreement in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which defines a firm agreement as an agreement with an unrelated party  binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable  with the following characteristics a the agreement specifies all significant terms  including the quantity to be exchanged  the fixed price and the timing of the transaction  and b the agreement includes a disincentive for nonperformance that is sufficiently large to make performance probable 
the enforceability of the ars rights results in a put option  which we recognized as a separate freestanding instrument that is accounted for separately from the ars investment 
as of december   we recorded million as fair value of the put option assets  classified as long term assets on the balance sheet as december   with a corresponding credit to interest and other  net in the statement of operations for the year ended december  the put option does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas therefore  we elected to measure the ars rights at fair value under sfas to mitigate volatility in reported earnings due to its linkage to the ars 
we valued the put option using a black scholes option pricing model that included estimates of interest rates  based on data available as of december   and was adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  any change in the assumptions on which these estimates are based or market conditions would affect the value of the ars rights 
prior to accepting the ubs settlement offer  we recorded our ars as investments available for sale 
we recorded unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale debt securities  in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet 
such an unrealized loss did not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period 
simultaneously  due to the ars rights granted by ubs  we made a one time election to transfer the related ars holdings from available for sale securities to trading securities 
as a result of this transfer  we recognized an other than temporary loss of approximately million  and reversed the related recognized loss that was previously recorded in other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
the recording of the ars rights under sfas and the recognition of the other than temporary impairment loss resulted in no net impact to the statement of operations for the year ended december  we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the ars rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related ars with no material net impact to the statement of operations  subject to the continued expected performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement 
the ars rights will continue to be measured at fair value under sfas until the earlier of our exercise of the ars rights  ubs s purchase of the ars in connection with the ars rights or the maturity of the ars underlying the ars rights 
in connection with the settlement  we entered into a loan agreement with ubs bank usa and ubs financial services inc on january   we borrowed approximately million under the loan agreement  with our ars held in accounts with ubs and its affiliates as collateral 
the loan amount was based on of the fair value as assessed by ubs at the time of the loan 
we have drawn down the full amount available under the loan agreement 
the amount of interest we will pay under the loan agreement is intended to equal the amount of interest we would otherwise receive with respect to our ars 
the borrowings under the loan agreement are payable upon demand 
however  ubs financial services inc or its affiliates will provide to us alternative financing on terms and conditions substantially the same as those under the loan agreement  unless the demand right was exercised as a result of certain specified events or the customer relationship between ubs and us is terminated for cause by ubs 
if such alternative financing cannot be established  then a ubs affiliate will purchase the pledged ars at par value 
proceeds of sales of our ars will first be applied to repayment of the loan with the balance  if any  for our account 
we continue to monitor the market for ars and consider its impact if any on the fair market value of our investments 
if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in earnings  offset by corresponding increases in the put option 
at present  if we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we may not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal until a future auction for these investments is successful  another secondary market evolves for these securities  they are redeemed by the issuer or 
table of contents they mature 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  we could be required to hold them to maturity 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on an ongoing basis for impairment 
shelf registration statement 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  which was declared effective in november the shelf registration statement allows us to issue shares of our common stock from time to time for an aggregate initial offering price of up to million 
the specific terms of offerings  if any  under the shelf registration statement would be established at the time of such offerings 
in august  we secured a new line of credit with ge capital of up to million to finance certain equipment until september  the line of credit was subject to the terms of a master security agreement between us and ge capital  dated february and as amended on march  and related term sheet 
as of december   this line of credit had expired and we had not borrowed any funds under this line 
as of december   future minimum payments under lease obligations and equipment financing lines were as follows in thousands within two to four to after one year three years five years five years total operating leases equipment financing line total our long term commitments under operating leases relate to payments under our two facility leases in south san francisco  california  which expire in and under the provisions of our amended collaboration and facilities agreement with portola pharmaceuticals  inc portola  we were obligated to reimburse portola for certain equipment costs incurred by portola in connection with research and related services that portola provided to us 
we began to incur these costs when the equipment became available for use in the second quarter of our payments to portola for such equipment costs  totaling  were made in eight quarterly installments commencing in the first quarter of and through the fourth quarter of no further payments are due under this agreement 
in future periods  we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to expand our research programs and related research and development activities 
we also plan to continue to conduct clinical development of our cardiac muscle myosin activator ck for the potential treatment of heart failure  of ispinesib for the potential treatment of breast cancer and of sb for the potential treatment of hodgkin and non hodgkin lymphoma 
we intend to continue to progress our skeletal sarcomere activator ck and our smooth muscle myosin inhibitor through ind enabling studies and to conduct clinical development of these potential drug candidates 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we advance the research and development of our other muscle contractility programs through research to candidate selection 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the initiation  progress  timing  scope and completion of preclinical research  development and clinical trials for our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by requirements of regulatory agencies  amgen s decision with respect to its option for ck  and if amgen exercises its option  amgen s decisions with regard to funding of development and commercialization of ck or other cardiac muscle myosin activators for the treatment of heart failure under our collaboration  gsk s decisions with regard to future funding of development of our drug gsk  our level of funding for the development of current or future drug candidates  
table of contents the number of drug candidates we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  our ability to establish and maintain selected strategic alliances required for the development and commercialization of our potential drugs  our plans or ability to expand our drug development capabilities  including our capabilities to conduct clinical trials for our drug candidates  our plans or ability to establish sales  marketing or manufacturing capabilities and to achieve market acceptance for potential drugs  expanding and advancing our research programs  hiring of additional employees and consultants  expanding our facilities  the acquisition of technologies  products and other business opportunities that require financial commitments  and our revenues  if any  from successful development of our drug candidates and commercialization of potential drugs 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  interest earned on investments  proceeds from our loan with ubs  and the proceeds from the kingsbridge committed equity financing facility will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
while amgen may choose to exercise its option for an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ck  there is no certainty this will occur 
if  at any time  our prospects for internally financing our research and development programs decline  we may decide to reduce research and development expenses by delaying  discontinuing or reducing our funding of development of one or more of our drug candidates or potential drug candidates or of other research and development programs 
alternatively  we might raise funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that funding  if needed  will be available on attractive terms  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
similarly  financing obtained through future strategic alliances may require us to forego certain commercialization and other rights to our drug candidates 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other 
table of contents assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
investments available for sale and trading investments 
our investments consist of ars  municipal and government agency bonds  commercial paper  us government treasury securities  and money market funds 
we designated all investments  except for ars held by ubs  as available for sale and are therefore reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reclassified ars held by ubs from available for sale to trading securities 
investments that we designate as trading assets are reported at fair value  with gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
see notes to financial statements note cash equivalents  investments and fair value measurements for further detailed discussion 
investments with original maturities greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified as short term investments 
investments with remaining maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments 
in addition  we classify investments as short term or long term based upon whether such assets are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the business 
other than temporary impairment 
all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments below the cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
factors considered by management in assessing whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred include the nature of the investment  whether the decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting the investment  the financial condition of the investee  the severity and the duration of the impairment  and whether we have the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
when we determine that an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the investment is written down to its market value at the end of the period in which we determine that an other than temporary decline had occurred 
the amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary  if any  on available for sale securities are included in other income or expense 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in interest and other  net 
the par value of our investments in ars totaled million at december  and million at december  we determined that no impairment of our investments existed at december  due to the resetting variable rates of these securities  their fair value generally approximated cost until february there were no realized gains or losses from these investments during the years ended december   or there had been no failed auctions on any of our ars through december  and we deemed that no impairment existed as of that date 
the unrealized loss on these investments was zero at december  at december   we classified million of its investment in ars as long term due to the uncertainty as to whether such securities will be available for current operations 
at december   we classified our investment in ars as long term investment trading securities  where unrealized gains and losses are recorded in current period earnings 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that certain criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for research performed and milestones met  and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 

table of contents research and development revenues  which are earned under agreements with third parties for contract research and development activities  may include non refundable license fees  research and development funding  cost reimbursements and contingent milestones and royalties 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue as we perform under the applicable agreement 
where the level of effort is relatively consistent over the performance period  we recognize total fixed or determined revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated period of expected performance 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  provided the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort and risk is involved in achieving the milestone and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if these conditions are not met  we defer the milestone payment and recognize it as revenue over the estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
research and development revenues and cost reimbursements are based upon negotiated rates for our ftes and actual out of pocket costs 
fte rates are intended to approximate our anticipated costs 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
none of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful 
in revenue arrangements in which both parties make payments to each other  we evaluate the payments in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products to determine whether payments made by us will be recognized as a reduction of revenue or as expense 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue we recognize may be reduced by payments made to the other party under the arrangement unless we receive a separate and identifiable benefit in exchange for the payments and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
the application of eitf issue no 
has not impacted us 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations cros  and other vendors 
for preclinical studies  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the percentage of work completed to date and contract milestones achieved 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  duration of enrollment and percentage of work completed to date 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and status meetings with cros and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are dependent on the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by our cros and other vendors 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate data  we may under or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies or clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity levels become known 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
stock based compensation we apply the provisions of sfas r  accounting for stock based compensation  which establishes accounting for share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the employee s requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award 
we elected the modified prospective transition method for awards granted subsequent to april   the date of our initial public offering  and the prospective transition method for awards granted prior to our initial public offering 
prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes under either transition method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based 
table of contents compensation  and complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods  or services 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates at the time  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if conditions change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
income taxes we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the financial statements and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to zero  because we believe that  based upon a number of factors  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
in july  the fasb issued fin fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts 
we adopted fin on january  the cumulative effect of adopting fin was recorded net in deferred tax assets  which resulted in no fin liability on the balance sheet 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was million 
see notes to financial statements  note income taxes for additional information 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits were million 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf issued a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaboration arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property  which is focused on how the parties to a collaborative agreement should account for costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties  how shared payments pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the income statement and certain related disclosure questions 
eitf issue no 
is to be applied retrospectively for collaboration arrangements in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt eitf issue no 
in the first quarter of and currently do not believe the adoption of eitf issue no

sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas expanded on the implementation guidance in sfas for estimating the present value of future cash flows for some hard to value financial instruments such as auction rate securities 
the adoption of sfas and sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position

the fair value option election is irrevocable and may generally be made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position as the fair value option was not elected for any of our financial assets or financial liabilities at the date of adoption  nor for any of our financial assets and liabilities transacted in the year ended december  except the put option resulting from ubs s ars right offering

we adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for non refundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf issue no 
states that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
entities should then continue to evaluate whether they expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest a portion of our excess cash in debt instruments of high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure in any one issuer and investment class 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by attempting to limit default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including us government and agency securities  high grade municipal and us bonds and money market funds 
our investment portfolio of short term investments is subject to interest rate risk  and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
at december   we held approximately million of ars classified as long term investments  whose underlying assets are student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and each auction since then has failed 
consequently  the 
table of contents investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  they are redeemed by the issuers or the investments mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
as of december   all our ars were aaa rated  the highest rating by a rating agency 
in february  the rating for certain of our ars with a par value of million was reduced to a at december   our investment advisors provided a valuation for the ars investments utilizing a discounted cash flow approach to arrive at the valuation of our ars  which was corroborated by a separate and comparable discounted cash flow analysis we prepared 
based on this level valuation defined by sfas  we valued the ars investments at million  which represents a decline in value of million from par 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
these assumptions are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  thereby could result in significant changes to the fair value of our ars 
in connection with the failed auctions of our ars  which were marketed and sold by ubs ag and its affiliates  in october  we accepted a settlement with ubs ag pursuant to which ubs ag has issued to us the ars rights 
the ars rights provide us the right to receive the par value of our ars  ie  the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid interest 
pursuant to the ars rights  we may require ubs to purchase our ars at par value at any time between june  and july  in addition  ubs or its affiliates may sell or otherwise dispose of some or all of the ars at its discretion at any time prior to expiration of the ars rights  subject to the obligation to pay us the par value of such ars 
the ars rights are not transferable  tradable or marginable  and will not be listed or quoted on any securities exchange or any electronic communications network 
as consideration for ars rights  we agreed to release ubs ag  ubs securities llc and ubs financial services  inc  and or their affiliates  directors  and officers from any claims directly or indirectly relating to the marketing and sale of the ars  other than for consequential damages 
ubs s obligations in connection with the ars rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support these obligations 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations in connection with the ars rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to purchase the ars and the auction process continues to fail  we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
we valued the put option using a black scholes option pricing model that included estimates of interest rates  based on data available as of december   and was adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  any change in these assumptions and market conditions would affect the value of the ars rights 
a decline in fair value of the ars would be largely offset by an increase in fair value of the ars rights 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded our ars as investments available for sale 
we recorded unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale debt securities  in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet 
such an unrealized loss did not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period 
simultaneously  due to the ars rights granted by ubs  we made a one time election to transfer the related ars holdings from available for sale securities to trading securities 
as a result of this transfer  we recognized an other than temporary loss of approximately million  and reversed the related temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded in other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet 
the recording of the ars rights under sfas and the recognition of the other than temporary impairment loss resulted in no net impact to the statement of operations for the year ended december  we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the ars rights will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related ars with no material net impact to the statement of operations  subject to ubs s continued expected performance of its obligations in connection with the ars rights 
the ars rights will continue to be measured at fair value under sfas until the earlier of our exercise of the ars rights  ubs s purchase of the ars in connection with the ars rights  or the maturity of the ars underlying the ars rights 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
consequently  we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to significant interest rate risk and have therefore excluded them from the table below 
on the liability side  our 
table of contents equipment financing lines carry fixed interest rates and therefore also may be subject to changes in fair value if market interest rates fluctuate 
we do not have any foreign currency or derivative financial instruments 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio  except ars  and equipment financing lines dollars in thousands fair value at december  beyond total assets short term investments average interest rate liabilities equipment financing lines average interest rate
