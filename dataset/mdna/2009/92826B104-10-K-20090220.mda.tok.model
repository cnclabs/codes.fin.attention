item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview virtual radiologic corporation is a leading provider of teleradiology services throughout the united states and we have recently begun expanding to serve customers in international markets 
we provide radiologic interpretations  or reads  for emergency and routine care cases through the utilization of a scalable communications network incorporating encrypted broadband internet connections and proprietary workflow management software 
we serve our customers radiology practices  hospitals  clinics and diagnostic imaging centers by providing reads hours a day  days a year 
our distributed operating model provides our team of american board of radiology certified radiologists with the flexibility to choose the location from which they work and allows us to serve customers located throughout the world 
we provide radiologic interpretations for a broad range of digital diagnostic imaging modalities  including ct  mri and ultrasound 
diagnostic radiology aids in the diagnosis and treatment of injuries  diseases and other medical conditions by interpreting images of the human body 
our affiliated radiologists collectively have the expertise  including subspecialty fellowship training  necessary to permit them to read all diagnostic imaging modalities  including ct  mri  ultrasound  nuclear medicine  pet  and x ray technology modalities 
currently  almost all of the reads performed by our affiliated radiologists are ct  mri  ultrasound  nuclear medicine and x ray technology modalities 
for the year ended december   of the reads we performed were ct scans 
we have recently begun to license the use of our proprietary radiology workflow engine  vrad enterprise connect sm  and provide operations support services to large radiology practices  hospital systems and academic medical facilities around the world 
the utilization of our proprietary teleradiology platform and radiology workflow engine  along with our operational support services enables customers to extend their services  enhance ancillary revenue and increase radiologist efficiency 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires the exercise of significant judgment and the use of estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the policies described in the following paragraphs to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and require critical management judgment and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
principles of consolidation we consolidate our financial results in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin r  which requires a primary beneficiary to consolidate entities determined to be variable interest entities  or vies 
we have determined that the affiliated medical practices are vies  and that vrc is the primary beneficiary of the affiliated medical practices  as defined by fin r  and as a result is required to consolidate the affiliated medical practices 
the following tables show the unaudited condensed consolidating balance sheets as of december  and  and the unaudited condensed consolidating statements of operations for the years ended december   and the amounts reflected in the eliminations columns of the condensed consolidating financial statements represent affiliated party management and professional fees and non controlling interest

table of contents revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our teleradiology services to radiology practices  hospitals  clinics and imaging centers 
teleradiology revenue is recognized in the period when a diagnostic read and operational support services have been completed and when collection is reasonably assured 
revenue realized through the licensing of vrad enterprise connect sm was not material for the year ended december  accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and generally do not bear interest 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectable receivables 
the allowance is comprised of specific reserves and a general reserve for potentially uncollectable amounts based on our historical bad debt experience 
in determining the amount of the specific reserve  we review the accounts receivable for customers who are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues 
we make judgments about their creditworthiness based on collections information available to us and historical payment performance 
we also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on historical credits issued 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf issue no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r and eitf  stock based compensation costs are estimated using the fair value of the award as calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and are recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the black scholes model utilizes various assumptions that require significant judgment  including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option term 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in future periods from what is recorded in the current period 
physician stock based compensation 
we record stock based compensation expense in connection with any equity instrument awarded to our affiliated radiologists in accordance with eitf issue no 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense related to such issuance by determining the then current fair value of the award using a black scholes model at the date of grant and at the end of each subsequent financial reporting period thereafter 
physician stock based compensation expense is included in professional services expense 
employee stock based compensation 
we also record stock based compensation expense in connection with any award of stock options to employees and directors 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense associated with such awards to our employees and directors granted prior to january   in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 using the intrinsic value method and in accordance with sfas no 
r for awards granted on or after january   by determining the fair value using a black scholes model 
we calculate the stock based compensation expense related to awards to our employees and directors based on the fair value of awards on the date granted 
employee stock based compensation expense is included in sales  general and administrative expense 
medical malpractice loss reserves we maintain professional liability insurance policies with third party insurers on a claims made basis  subject to a self insured retention  deductibles  exclusions and other restrictions 
our self insured retention under our professional liability insurance program is insured through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 
we record liabilities for specific case reserves  claims made loss development reserves and claims incurred but not reported based on specific case analysis and an actuarial valuation using industry data and our historical loss patterns 
the actuarial analysis utilizes industry loss data as a result of our limited loss history 
an inherent assumption in such estimates is that industry data and our historical loss patterns can be used to predict future patterns with reasonable accuracy 
insurance liabilities are necessarily based on estimates  including claim frequency and severity 
because many factors can affect historical and future loss patterns  the determination of an appropriate reserve involves complex  subjective judgment  and actual results may vary significantly from estimates 

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill we account for acquired goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  or sfas no 
and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
as such  we record acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities  at their respective fair values  recording to goodwill the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the values assigned to identifiable intangible assets are based on valuations that have been prepared using methodologies and valuation techniques consistent with those used by independent appraisers 
these methodologies and techniques utilize various assumptions that require significant judgment  including an estimation of the future cash flows of identifiable intangible assets and the discounting of cash flows to their present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return  or discount rate 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
in accordance with sfas no 
we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired 
our tests are based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure 
we found no impairment of recognized goodwill as of december  income taxes vrc recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method 
as such  deferred taxes are based on the temporary differences  if any  between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts 
the deferred taxes are determined using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period plus the change during the period in deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
developing a provision for income taxes  including the effective tax rate and the analysis of potential tax exposure items  if any  requires significant judgment and expertise in federal  state and foreign income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets 
our judgment and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and or cash flows 
as previously noted  we consolidate our financial results under the provisions of fin r 
for income tax purposes  however  we are not considered a consolidated entity 
as a result  income generated by the affiliated medical practices  as well as any losses they are able to fund  are excluded from vrc s calculation of income tax liability 
in addition  losses generated by the affiliated medical practices that are funded by vrc result in temporary differences between vrc s book and tax bases of accounting 
these temporary differences will reverse in future periods to the extent those losses are able to be recovered by vrc 
vrc s federal income tax return is currently under examination by the internal revenue service  or irs 
in addition  vrp s federal income tax return is currently under examination by the irs and  in conjunction with their audit of vrp s federal income tax return  the irs is also examining the quarterly employment tax returns of vrp 
these examinations are in the preliminary stages and we continue to work with the irs to expedite the conclusion of these examinations 
at this time we do not believe the results of these examinations will have a material adverse effect on us  however the timing and results of any final determination remain uncertain and any adverse determination from the irs could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
trends in our business and factors affecting our results of operations during  we continued to focus our growth initiatives on supplementing our core teleradiology business through the expansion of our unique distributed operating model and enhancements to our proprietary workflow management software 
we continued to focus on acquiring new customers  attracting and retaining additional radiologists  generating additional sales from existing customers and further penetration into the finals read market 

table of contents in addition  we expanded our service offerings through the licensing of a technology infrastructure and operations support services product called vrad enterprise connect sm 
this product provides customers with the ability to schedule  organize  assign  track and report on thousands of reads every day 
the utilization of our proprietary teleradiology platform along with our operational support services enables customers to extend their services  enhance ancillary revenue and increase radiologist efficiency 
we also expanded our service offerings outside the united states by signing customers in singapore  united arab emirates and brazil through vrc s international subsidiary  vrl 
we completed our first acquisition on april  when we acquired diagna radiology  llc  or diagna 
diagna was an idaho based teleradiology practice with independent contractor physicians and customers serving hospitals and other medical facilities 
all customers and radiologists were successfully transitioned to our operating platform during in august  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
on october   we completed this stock repurchase program 
we repurchased  shares at an average price of per share 
repurchases took place in the open market and pursuant to trading plans meeting the requirements of rule b of the securities exchange act of revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue from the radiology services that we provide to our customers 
we generally seek to provide these services pursuant to contracts that have a two year term and automatically renew for successive one year terms unless terminated by the customer or by us 
the amount that we charge for our radiology services varies by customer and is based upon a number of factors  including the hours of coverage  the number of reads  whether the reads are preliminary reads or final reads  and the technical and administrative services provided 
we typically bill our customers at the beginning of the month following the month in which the services were provided 
because we primarily contract directly with our customers and are paid directly by our customers  we do not generally depend upon payment by third party payers such as medicare  medicaid  private insurance or patients 
we have experienced significant revenue growth since our inception 
recently our growth in revenue resulted from an increase in our customer base  an increase in utilization of our services by our customers  an increase in volume of higher priced final reads  high customer retention rates  and customer relationships acquired through our acquisition of diagna 
the above factors have been partially offset by declines in our average price per study and declines in same site volume growth since our inception 
our revenues are also affected by seasonality 
while our revenues have continued to grow each year  we typically experience increased demand for our services and higher revenue growth during the third quarter of each year 
we believe that during the summer months there are an increased amount of outdoor and transportation activities  which leads to more hospital visits  as well as there being more frequent vacation time taken by our customers radiologists 
we expect this seasonality with respect to our revenues to continue 
our operating results are thus subject to seasonal fluctuations  which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our performance to fall short of quarterly expectations 
in addition  our revenues are affected by fluctuations in the price per study charged to the customers to whom we provide service 
in general  we have seen the greatest per read pricing declines in preliminary reads and specifically in ct and plain film reads 
more recently our customers have been impacted by the economic downturn 
this resulted in a decrease in hospital admissions during the second half of  affecting overall imaging volumes 
we believe that the downturn also prompted some of our radiology practice customers to work longer hours thereby reducing the number of studies they sent to us 
these factors resulted in us experiencing slower 
table of contents than historical growth rates in the second half of in addition we saw an increased amount of pricing pressure from competition in our marketplace 
we expect these declines in price to continue for the near future 
in addition we are unable to predict what impact a continued economic downturn will have on our business or when general economic conditions will improve 
key revenue metrics for the year ended december  change change change customers facilities reads of us hospitals served same site volume growth percentage of read revenue from final reads preliminary reads year over year change in price per read plain film all other total percentage change in price per read from price mix plain film modality includes all x ray technology images 
all other modalities are primarily comprised of ct  mri and ultrasound images 
we also expect to derive revenue in the future from contracts we have recently entered into for the licensing of our technology infrastructure including vrad enterprise connect sm and the provision of management and support services 
operating expenses our operating expenses consist primarily of professional services expense and sales  general and administrative expense 
professional services expense 
our professional services expense consists of the fees we pay to our affiliated radiologists for their services  physician stock based compensation and medical malpractice liability expense 
physician cash compensation expense 
physician cash compensation expense is the fees paid to our affiliated radiologists for providing diagnostic interpretation services for our customers 
we compensate our affiliated radiologists using a formula that includes a base level of compensation and additional amounts with regard to the number of hours worked and the number and type of reads performed 
we recognize physician cash compensation expense in the month in which our affiliated radiologists perform the reads for our customers 
physician cash compensation also includes amounts paid for quality assurance services 
since our inception  our physician cash compensation expense has increased each year as we have added more affiliated radiologists to fulfill the increased demand for our services as our business and customer base has grown 
however  physician cash compensation expense as a percentage of revenue has decreased due to the increased productivity of our affiliated radiologists 
the increases in productivity by the existing 
table of contents affiliated radiologists have been  and may continue to be  offset  in part  by significant increases in newly engaged affiliated radiologists and the costs associated with the typical to day period during which newly engaged affiliated radiologists obtain necessary state licenses and hospital credentials  and thereafter become accustomed to our workflow technology 
we expect that our physician cash compensation expense will continue to increase  but may decrease as a percentage of revenues over time as the efficiency and utilization of our affiliated radiologists improves 
physician stock based compensation expense 
we record stock based compensation expense in connection with any award of stock options to our affiliated radiologists 
physician stock based compensation expense is a non cash expense that fluctuates based upon the fair value of our common stock underlying the awards at the close of each reporting period as required by eitf issue no 
as the value of an award is based on the underlying value of the common stock  we may record additional expense or income based on fluctuations in that value 
our physician stock based compensation expense may also increase in future periods if we issue additional options and other stock based awards to our affiliated radiologists 
medical liability expense 
medical liability expense consists primarily of premiums paid for third party medical malpractice insurance  claims made loss development reserves related to our self insured retention and incurred but not reported  or ibnr  loss reserves 
we amortize medical liability insurance premiums over the term of the policy to which they related and recognize loss development and ibnr reserves based on actuarial analyses performed during the policy term 
our medical liability expense has increased each year since inception due to the increases in our medical liability insurance premiums primarily associated with the increased volume of reads our affiliated radiologists have performed 
in addition  as a result of the growth in our business we have experienced an increase in loss claim frequency which has resulted in an increase in loss reserves during key professional service metrics for the year ended december  radiologists under contract radiologists providing services average diagnostic cash compensation per read sales  general and administrative expense 
sales  general and administrative expense is our second most significant expense as a percentage of revenue 
sales  general and administrative expense consists primarily of employee compensation expense  sales and marketing expense  information technology expense  the costs associated with the licensing and credentialing of our affiliated radiologists and the costs associated with maintaining our facilities 
our sales  general and administrative expense has increased each year since our inception as a result of increased employee compensation expenses and costs associated with development and maintenance of our expanding business  such as information technology and facilities costs 
we expect sales  general and administrative expense to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue in the near term  however  we believe that this expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue over time

comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenue year ended december  change in dollars percentage dollars in thousands revenue from reads other revenue total revenue the increase in revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   resulted primarily from an increase in the number of customers to whom we provided services  including customer relationships acquired through the purchase of diagna  and increased volume from existing customers 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in our average price per read 
the number of customers to whom we provided services increased to as of december   from as of december  the number of medical facilities to whom we provide services increased to  as of december   from as of december  for the years ended december  and  approximately of our revenues from reads were derived from preliminary reads and approximately from final reads

for the year ended december   the number of physicians performing reads increased  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  medical malpractice liability expense increased due to additional loss reserves resulting from an increase in loss claim frequency 
the decrease in the non cash component of professional service expense resulted from physician stock based compensation related primarily to the decreased fair value of our common stock

employee compensation 
our employee compensation expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in non cash employee stock based compensation expense and increased compensation paid to existing employees 
the increase in non cash employee stock based compensation from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  relates primarily to an increase in the number of options outstanding as of december  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in performance based bonus compensation 
in addition  the number of administrative and operations personnel decreased from december  to december  employee compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from the hiring of additional sales professionals during and higher commissions on increased revenue

information technology 
our information technology expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from increased provisioning costs for data center floor space and communications bandwidth and additional radiologist network connections together with increases in software transactional costs associated with our growth in volumes 
information technology expense as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other general and administrative 
our other general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the settlement of a medical malpractice claim and from the establishment of loss reserves for additional medical malpractice claims 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment charges of  related to a portion of a trade show booth that is no longer being utilized and  for internally developed software that is no longer expected to generate future economic benefit 
we also experienced significant increases in repairs and maintenance expense  general insurance expense  facilities expense and outside accounting and board of director fees relating to the costs of being a public company and the growth in our business 
other general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we believe that sales  general and administrative expenses  including the costs related to being a public company  will increase as we continue to grow 
we also anticipate that in the near term our sales  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue will increase  however  we believe that this expense will decrease as a percentage of revenue over time 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the purchase of additional capital equipment for our operations and the amortization of customer relationship and non compete intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of diagna 
we believe that depreciation and amortization expense will increase in the future 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was and for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
other income expense 
other income expense increased from expense of million for the year ended december  to income of  for the year ended december  this increase in other income expense relates primarily to the interest earned on the proceeds from our initial public offering and the fact that we had no debt outstanding during the twelve months ended december  income tax expense 
income tax expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our provision for income taxes increased million as a result of an increase in vrc s taxable income from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by certain discrete tax benefits recognized in the second half of related to research and development tax credits 
as a result of these items the effective tax rate decreased from in to in as previously discussed  we consolidate our financial results in accordance with fin r 
however  for income tax purposes  vrc is a single tax entity that is taxed as a corporation and is not included in a tax consolidated group with the affiliated medical practices 
as a result  tax losses of the affiliated medical practices are not available to offset taxable income of vrc 
this was the primary driver behind the effective tax rate for the year ended december

licensing and credentialing 
our licensing and credentialing related expenses increased from  for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase relates primarily to the amount and timing of initial and renewal license applications on a greater number of affiliated radiologists  which was partially offset by the comparatively lower costs of renewal applications 
licensing and credentialing related expenses as a percentage of revenue were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other general and administrative 
our other general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase resulted from an increase in facilities expense and outside professional expense as well as other general operating expense primarily due to our initial public offering and the growth in our business 
other general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the increase in depreciation expense related to additional capital equipment purchased for our operations 

table of contents other income expense 
other income expense decreased from income of  for the year ended december  to expense of million for the year ended december  this increase in other income expense relates to the interest and accelerated amortization of capitalized closing costs associated with our credit facility in place during income tax expense 
income tax expense increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   which resulted primarily from an increase in pre tax net income for vrc from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  because vrc is a single tax entity that is taxed as a corporation and is not included in a tax consolidated group with the affiliated medical practices  tax losses of the affiliated medical practices are not available to offset taxable income of vrc 
the difference in the consolidated group for financial statement purposes and tax purposes  combined with the valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards of certain of the affiliated medical practices  resulted in the increase in income tax expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these factors resulted in an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  compared to a rate of for the year ended december  preferred stock accretion 
preferred stock accretion decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this accretion relates to our series a preferred stock  which was issued on may   and is calculated based on the difference between the estimated fair value of the series a preferred stock as of the consolidated balance sheet date compared to the fair value of the stock on the previous consolidated balance sheet date 
all shares of our series a preferred stock were converted to common stock at the time of our initial public offering  and as a result  there was no further recognition of preferred stock accretion or decretion for periods after december
