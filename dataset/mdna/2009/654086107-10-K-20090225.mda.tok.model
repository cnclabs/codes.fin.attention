table of contents rate proceeding 
on april   nicor gas filed with the icc for an overall increase in rates 
the company s filing  as updated  provides a revenue increase of million for a rate of return on rate base of percent  which reflects an percent cost of common equity 
the requested rate increase is needed to recover higher operating costs and increased capital investments 
in its rate filing  nicor gas has proposed some new rate adjustment mechanisms 
these include mechanisms that would adjust rates to reflect certain changes in the company s bad debt expense and cost of gas used for operations 
also included are a volume balancing rider that would adjust rates to recover fixed costs  an energy efficiency rider that would fund energy efficiency programs and a rider that would adjust rates to recover a portion of capital expenditures incurred to replace certain older infrastructure 
on february   the aljs proposed order was issued recommending an increase in base revenues of approximately million  a rate of return on rate base of percent and a rate of return on equity of percent 
the proposed order also includes approval of a volume balancing rider that would adjust rates to recover fixed costs and an energy efficiency rider that would fund energy efficiency programs 
nicor gas and other parties to the proceeding will have the opportunity to file written briefs to identify points where they agree or disagree with the proposed order 
after considering these briefs  the aljs may modify the proposed order before submitting it as their recommendation to the icc commissioners 
the icc commissioners will then make the final decision on nicor gas rate increase request and that decision may differ from the aljs recommendation 
that final decision is expected to be issued no later than march  new rates would be effective prospectively 
capital market environment 
the volatility in the capital markets during has caused general concern over the valuations of investments  exposure to increased credit risk and pressures on liquidity 
the company has reviewed its investments  exposure to credit risk and sources of liquidity and  with the exception of the impact on postretirement benefit costs discussed below  does not currently expect any future material adverse impacts relating to these items 
the company sponsored defined benefit pension plan experienced significant declines in the market values of its investments in these market value declines adversely impact the company s future postretirement benefit costs in two ways 
first  the expected return on the pension plan s assets which serves to reduce postretirement benefit costs will decline as a result of the lower asset market values 
second  the pension plan s actuarial losses largely due to the decline in asset market values will be amortized over the average remaining service life of plan participants 
as a regulated utility  nicor gas expects continued rate recovery of the eligible costs of its defined benefit postretirement plans and  accordingly  associated changes in the plan s funded status have been deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until recognized in net income  instead of being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the adverse impact of both factors on postretirement benefit costs compared to costs is approximately million 
about one fourth of this added cost will be capitalized as a cost of constructing gas distribution facilities and the remainder will be included in gas distribution operating and maintenance expense  net of any amounts charged to affiliates 
the fair value of the company s defined benefit pension plan assets still exceeds the projected benefit obligation at december  the company does not expect to make any contributions to the plan in however  if market values of the plan assets continue to significantly decline  the company may be required to make a contribution

table of contents costing of physical sales activity and improved results from the company s risk management activities associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by nicor s energy related products and services businesses  partially offset by unfavorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory 
nicor enerchange uses derivatives to mitigate commodity price risk in order to substantially lock in the profit margin that will ultimately be realized 
a source of commodity price risk arises as nicor enerchange purchases and holds natural gas in storage to earn a profit margin from its ultimate sale 
however  gas stored in inventory is required to be accounted for at the lower of weighted average cost or market  whereas the derivatives used to reduce the risk associated with a change in the value of the inventory are carried at fair value  with changes in fair value recorded in operating results in the period of change 
in addition  nicor enerchange also uses derivatives to mitigate the commodity price risks of the utility bill management products offered by nicor s energy related products and services businesses 
the gains and losses associated with the utility bill management products are recognized in the months that the services are provided 
however  the underlying derivatives used to hedge the price exposure are carried at fair value 
for those derivatives that don t meet the requirements for hedge accounting  the changes in fair value are recorded in operating results in the period of change 
as a result  earnings are subject to volatility as the fair value of derivatives change 
the volatility resulting from this accounting can be significant from period to period 
corporate and eliminations operating income for  and was impacted by the following items in  corporate and eliminations operating income included million of costs associated with nicor s other energy ventures utility bill management products attributable to colder than normal weather excludes costs of approximately million recorded within other energy ventures 
in  corporate and eliminations operating income included million of benefits associated with nicor s other energy ventures utility bill management products attributable to warmer than normal weather excludes costs of approximately million recorded within other energy ventures 
in  there was no material weather impact related to other energy ventures utility bill management contracts 
the above noted benefits or costs resulting from variances from normal weather related to these products are recorded primarily at the corporate level as a result of an agreement between the parent company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the weather impact of these contracts generally serves to partially offset the gas distribution segment s weather risk 
the amount of the offset attributable to the utility bill management products marketed by nicor s other energy ventures will vary depending upon a number of factors including the time of year  weather patterns  the number of customers for these products and the market price for natural gas 
in  corporate and eliminations operating income included recoveries of previously incurred legal costs of million 
the legal cost recoveries were from a counterparty with whom nicor previously did business during the pbr timeframe 
the total recovery was million  of which million was allocated to corporate and million was allocated to the gas distribution segment recorded as a reduction to operating and maintenance expense

nicor s other energy ventures operating revenues decreased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to lower revenues at nicor s energy related products and services businesses million decrease and nicor enerchange million decrease 
lower revenues at nicor s energy related products and services businesses were due to lower average revenue per utility bill management contract  attributable to product mix 
lower revenues at nicor enerchange were due primarily to unfavorable changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory and lower results from the company s risk management activities associated with hedging the product risks of the utility bill management contracts offered by nicor s energy related products and services businesses  partially offset by the favorable costing of physical sales activity

table of contents changes in valuations of derivative instruments used to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas inventory 
higher revenues at nicor s energy related products and services businesses were attributable to an increase in average customer contracts million increase 
corporate and eliminations primarily reflects the elimination of gas distribution revenues against nicor solutions expenses for customers purchasing the utility bill management products 
gas distribution margin 
nicor utilizes a measure it refers to as gas distribution margin to evaluate the operating income impact of gas distribution revenues 
gas distribution revenues include natural gas costs  which are passed directly through to customers without markup  subject to icc review  and revenue taxes  for which nicor gas earns a small administrative fee 
these items often cause significant fluctuations in gas distribution revenues  with equal and offsetting fluctuations in cost of gas and revenue tax expense  with no direct impact on gas distribution margin 
a reconciliation of gas distribution revenues and margin follows in millions gas distribution revenues cost of gas revenue tax expense gas distribution margin gas distribution margin increased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to colder weather approximately million increase and the impact of customer interest approximately million increase 
gas distribution margin increased million in compared to the prior year due to colder weather approximately million increase  partially offset by lower average distribution rates approximately million decrease which included the negative impact of approximately million attributable to the icc s rate order rehearing decision that went into effect in april and the impact of customer interest approximately million decrease 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased million in compared to the prior year due primarily to higher bad debt expense million increase and payroll and benefit related costs million increase 
higher bad debt expense is attributable to higher revenues and worsening economic conditions 
also included in gas distribution operating and maintenance expense for were recoveries of previously incurred costs million  of which million relates to a recovery of costs associated with the prior year pcb matter and million relates to legal cost recoveries from a counterparty with whom nicor previously did business during the pbr timeframe 
gas distribution operating and maintenance expense increased million in compared to the prior year 
higher bad debt expense million increase was partially offset by lower company use gas and storage related gas costs million decrease attributable primarily to lower prices paid for natural gas
