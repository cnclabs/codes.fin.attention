item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
some of the information in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this form k  including our plans and strategies for our business  includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
please review the forward looking statements and the risk factors sections of this form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those anticipated or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for endocrine disorders such as diabetes  which may be safer  more effective and more convenient for patients 
we develop our product candidates by applying our proprietary formulation technologies to existing drugs in order to improve their therapeutic profiles 
our initial development efforts are focused on peptide hormones 
our most advanced product candidate  viaject  has been studied in two pivotal phase clinical trials for the treatment of patients with type and type diabetes 
earlier stage product candidates include viatab  a sublingual tablet formulation of insulin 
viaject is our proprietary injectable formulation of recombinant human insulin designed to be absorbed into the blood faster than the currently marketed rapid acting insulin analogs 
we have recently completed two pivotal phase clinical trials of viaject  one in patients with type diabetes and the other in patients with type diabetes 
in both clinical trials we compared viaject to humulin r  a form of recombinant human insulin 
we believe viaject can improve the management of blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes by more closely mimicking the natural first phase insulin release that healthy individuals experience at mealtime 
patients in both clinical trials were treated for a period of six months 
in march  we announced our plan to submit an nda to the fda by the end of to market viaject for the treatment of diabetes 
we expect that the nda will be submitted under section b of the ffdca and be based upon results from multiple pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies as well as our two completed phase studies of viaject in patients with type and type diabetes 
we intend to seek approval for a iu cc liquid formulation of viaject that is bioequivalent to the two part iu cc lyophilized powder formulation of viaject that was used in our pivotal phase clinical trials 
in october we executed a letter of intent to purchase a disposable insulin pen designed by wockhardt ltd 
for use with viaject 
we intend to submit this pen to the fda for review at a later date after completing certain modifications that we believe will improve its commercial performance 
in we plan to conduct additional clinical trials designed to generate additional data to enhance viaject s potential commercial success 
we have developed all of our product candidates utilizing our proprietary viadel technology  which allows us to study the interaction between peptide hormones and small molecules 
we use our technology to reformulate existing peptide drugs with small molecule ingredients that are generally regarded as safe by the fda to improve their therapeutic profiles 
we are a development stage company 
we were incorporated in december and commenced active operations in january to date  we have generated no revenues and have incurred significant losses 
we have financed our operations and internal growth through our initial public offering in may and follow on offering in february and prior to that  private placements of convertible preferred stock and other securities 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
our net loss was million for the year ended september  as of september   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
the deficit accumulated during the development stage is attributable primarily to our research and development activities and non cash charges for accretion of beneficial conversion rights and deemed dividend warrants and stock based compensation 
research and development and general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net loss applicable to common stockholders  represent approximately and  respectively  of the expenses that we have incurred since our inception 
we expect to continue to generate significant losses as we continue to develop our product candidates 
financial operations overview revenues to date  we have generated no revenues 
we do not expect to begin generating any revenues unless any of our product candidates receive marketing approval or if we receive payments in connection with strategic collaborations that we may enter into for the commercialization of our product candidates 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of the cost associated with our basic research activities  as well as the costs associated with our drug development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  manufacturing development efforts and activities related to regulatory filings 
our research and development expenses consist of external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigative sites  third party manufacturing organizations and consultants  employee related expenses  which include salaries and benefits for the personnel involved in our preclinical and clinical drug development and manufacturing activities  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
while we have suspended significant expenditures on our earlier stage product candidates and any enlargement of our laboratory facilities pending further development of our regulatory plans for viaject  we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we continue our clinical trial extension program for the pivotal phase clinical trials of viaject  which is designed to run through february  conduct additional clinical trials of viaject to support our commercialization efforts and  potentially  fda approval  and purchase recombinant human insulin and other materials to build commercial supply inventory for viaject 
if we obtain regulatory approval for viaject  research and development expenses may increase significantly as we prepare for the commercial launch of viaject and reinvigorate development work on our early stage product candidates 
we have used our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research projects  including our drug development programs 
to date  we have not tracked expenses related to our product development activities on a program by program basis 
accordingly  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of research and development expenses that we incurred with respect to each of our clinical and preclinical product candidates 
however  substantially all of our research and development expenses incurred to date are attributable to our viaject program 
the following table illustrates  for each period presented  our research and development costs by nature of the cost 
december  inception to year ended september  september  in thousands research and development expenses pre clinical expenses manufacturing expenses clinical regulatory expenses total the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  specific timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates 
this is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to secure approval by the fda for our product candidates under section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or the ffdca  our ability to file our nda for viaject in december as planned and  once filed  the length of time that will elapse before our nda is fully reviewed by the fda  the costs associated with preparing and submitting our maa for viaject to the emea  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for product candidates  particularly viaject  our ability to secure approval by the fda for viaject without conducting additional pivotal clinical trials  
table of contents the fda s findings regarding data anomalies observed in india in our phase clinical trial of viaject for patients with type diabetes and the impact of those findings on the timing of a regulatory approval  the size  endpoints and duration of additional clinical trials of viaject to support our commercialization efforts and  potentially  fda approval  the cost to fully develop the iu cc liquid formulation of viaject  our ability to establish that the iu cc liquid formulation of viaject is well tolerated in chronic use  the cost to develop an insulin pen program for use with viaject  the costs of pre commercialization activities  including increased insulin purchases  the costs associated with qualifying and obtaining regulatory approval of suppliers of insulin and manufacturers of our product candidates  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and the terms and success of the collaborations  including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from potential strategic collaborators 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of viaject or our other product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with product development 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authority were to require us to conduct an additional pivotal phase clinical trial of viaject  we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of that clinical development program 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expenses  in our executive  legal  accounting  finance and information technology functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense  travel expenses  costs associated with industry conventions and professional fees  such as legal and accounting fees and consulting costs 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will not change significantly as we focus our product development efforts on obtaining regulatory approval for viaject 
over the longer term  however  these expenses could increase as we approach the commercial launch of viaject marketable securities in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic  investments in debt and equity securities issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb in may  our marketable securities were classified as available for sale 
in accordance with that standard  these securities are reported at market value with unrealized gains and losses shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we regularly evaluate the performance of these investments individually for impairment  taking into consideration the investment  volatility and current returns 
if a determination is made that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the related securities are written down to their estimated fair value 
as of september  and  the company had million and marketable security investments  respectively 
pre launch inventory inventory costs associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit 
if the probability of future commercial use and future economic benefit cannot be reasonably determined  then costs associated with pre launch inventory that has not yet received regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense during the period the costs are incurred 
for the year ended september   the company expensed million of costs associated with the purchase of recombinant human insulin  as research and development expense after it passed quality control inspection by the company and transfer of title occurred 
the company plans on submitting the nda for viaject in december until the company can determine the probability of viaject receiving regulatory approval  costs associated with the purchase of recombinant human insulin will continue to be expensed as research and development 
comprehensive income loss we classify our marketable securities as available for sale  in accordance with asc topic  comprehensive income  issued by the fasb in june other comprehensive income include changes in equity for unrealized holding gains losses on marketable securities  which have arisen during the period 
during the year ended september   marketable security investments were sold at a par value and the september  net unrealized loss of was fully recaptured 

table of contents interest income interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  resulting primarily from the million in net proceeds received from our initial public offering in may and follow on offering in february in november  our board of directors approved investment policy guidelines  the primary objectives of which are the preservation of capital  the maintenance of liquidity and maintenance of appropriate fiduciary control subject to our business objectives and tax situation 
due to the uncertainty in the credit and financial markets  along with our intention to file an nda in december and secure fda approval of viaject  we have modified our investment strategy and primarily invested in certain marketable securities  which consist primarily of short to intermediate term debt securities issued by the us government  treasury securities and us government agencies 
the focus on preserving cash and investing in stable securities generated lower returns during the year ended september  during the period from before we file our nda until the fda finishes its review of our nda  we intend to maintain this conservative strategy until the credit and financial markets improve and become more stable 
exercise of warrants in march  we offered the holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our series b convertible preferred stock and an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share the opportunity to exercise such warrants at an exercise price of  representing a discount in the exercise price 
such holders exercised all of such warrants on a combination of cashless and cash exercise basis 
we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock and received aggregate cash proceeds of approximately million in connection with such exercises 
as a result of the discounted exercise price  in the fiscal quarter ended march   we recorded a deemed dividend charge of approximately million for the warrants that were so exercised 
as of september   we had warrants outstanding to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this form k  we believe that the following accounting policies  which we have discussed with our audit committee  are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals in preparing our financial statements  we must estimate accrued expenses pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturers that conduct and manage preclinical studies  clinical trials and manufacture product for these trials on our behalf 
this process involves communicating with relevant personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for services when we have not yet been invoiced for or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
the financial terms of these agreements vary and may result in uneven payment flows 
to date  we have not adjusted our estimates at any balance sheet date in any material amount 
examples of preclinical study  clinical trial and manufacturing expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and professional service fees 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  in the financial statements based on fair value 
the fair value of the stock underlying the options is a significant factor in determining credits or charges to operations appropriate for the stock based payments to both employees and non employees 
we selected the black scholes valuation model as the most appropriate valuation method for stock option grants to employees  members of our board of directors and non employees 
the fair value of these stock option grants is estimated as of their date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
because we lack sufficient company specific historical and implied volatility information  we based our estimate of expected volatility on the median historical volatility of a group of publicly traded companies that we believe are comparable to us based on the criteria set forth in accounting standards codification asc topic c and sab topic d  particularly line of business  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
we will continue to consistently apply this process using the same companies or  if those companies become no longer comparable  other appropriately comparable companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our share price becomes available 
however  we will regularly review these comparable companies  and may substitute more appropriate companies if facts and circumstances warrant a change 
we use the average of the weighted average vesting period and the contractual life of the option  eight years  as the estimated term of the option 
the risk free rate of interest for periods within the contractual life of the stock option is based on the yield of a us treasury strip on the date the award is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the award 
we estimate forfeitures based on actual forfeitures during our limited history 
additionally  we have assumed that dividends will not be paid 
for options granted to non employees and non directors  primarily consultants serving on our scientific advisory board  we measure fair value of the equity instruments utilizing the black scholes valuation model  if that value is more reliably measurable than the fair value of the consideration or service received 
the fair value of these equity investments are periodically revalued as the options vest and are recognized as expense over the related period of service or the vesting period  whichever is longer 
as of september   we issued to these non employees options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
because we must revalue these options for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the stock based compensation expense related to these non employee options will increase or decrease  based on changes in the price of our common stock 
for the years ended september   and  the stock based compensation expense related to these options was million  million  and million  respectively 
for the year ended september   the stock based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the stock based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended september   the stock based compensation expense was million  of which million is reflected in research and development expenses and million is reflected in general and administrative expenses 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of september   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  connecticut state net operating loss carryforwards of million and federal and local research and development tax credit carryovers of approximately million  all of which expire starting in at september   we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of approximately million  as our management believes it is uncertain that it will be fully realized 
if we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination 

table of contents results of operations year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in research and development costs related to our recently completed pivotal phase clinical trials for viaject and a decrease of million in the costs of manufacturing clinical supplies 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million for the purchase of recombinant human insulin during the fiscal year in order to build commercial supply inventory for viaject and an increase of million in professional fees for the preparation of the filing of our planned nda 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to non employees 
while we have suspended significant expenditures on our earlier stage product candidates pending further development of our regulatory plans for viaject  we do not anticipate that our research and development expenses will decrease materially  if at all  as we continue our phase clinical trial extension program for viaject  conduct new clinical trials of viaject  produce validation batches  and purchase recombinant human insulin 
general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this decrease is attributable to the following items a decrease of million in stock based compensation charges for the non employee directors due to a change in vesting policy from immediate vesting to vesting pro rata over one year  a decrease of million in professional fees  a decrease of million in personnel expenses and a decrease of million in travel expenses were due to a one time event that occurred in general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
because we must revalue options granted to non employees for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the stock based compensation income for the year ended september  was thousand 
we do not expect our general and administrative expenses to increase significantly over the next twelve months as we focus our product development efforts on obtaining regulatory approval for viaject 
over the longer term  however  we anticipate these expenses will increase as we approach the commercial launch of viaject 

table of contents interest and other income 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was due to shifting our investments primarily into treasury securities 
the focus on preserving cash and investing in stable securities generated lower returns during the year ended september  interest expense 
for the years ended september  and  we had no interest expense 
net loss and net loss per share 
year ended september  decrease in thousands  except per share amounts net loss net loss per share net loss was million  or per share  for the year ended september  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the decrease in net loss was primarily attributable to the decreased expenses described above 
while we have suspended significant expenditures of our earlier stage product candidates in order to focus our product developments efforts on obtaining regulatory approval for viaject  we expect our losses to continue as we initiate additional clinical trials of viaject to support our commercialization efforts and  potentially  fda approval 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  revenue 
we did not recognize any revenue during the years ended september  or research and development expenses 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts research and development percentage of net loss research and development expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to increased research and development costs related to our recently completed pivotal phase clinical trials for viaject 
specific increases in research and development expenses included million related to increased clinical trial expenses in  million related to increased manufacturing expenses in for the process development  scale up and manufacture of commercial batches of viaject to support our clinical trials and regulatory submissions  and million related to increased personnel costs  non cash stock based compensation expenses and consulting fees 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees and million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to non employees 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts general and administrative percentage of net loss general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended september   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in personnel expense 
the balance of the increase was attributable to increases in insurance expenses  depreciation expenses and higher legal and consulting fees associated with becoming a public company 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  include million in stock based compensation expense related to options granted to employees 
because we must revalue options granted to non employees for accounting purposes each reporting period  the amount of the stock based compensation expense for the year ended september  was thousand 
interest and other income 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts interest and other income percentage of net loss interest and other income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents in  resulting primarily from the million in net proceeds received from our initial public offering in may and follow on offering in february interest expense 
for the years ended september  and  we had no interest expense 
deemed dividend warrants 
on march   we offered the holders of warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of series b convertible preferred stock and an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share the opportunity to exercise such warrants at an exercise price of  representing a discount in the exercise price 
such holders exercised all such warrants on a combination of cashless and cash exercise basis 
we issued  shares of common stock and received aggregate cash proceeds of million in connection with such exercises 
as a result of the discounted exercise price  we recorded a non cash deemed dividend of approximately million for the warrants that were exercised in the year ended september  no equivalent charge to stockholders was incurred in the year ended september  net loss applicable to common stockholders and net loss per share 
year ended september  increase in thousands  except per share amounts net loss applicable to common stockholders net loss per share net loss applicable to common stockholders was million  or per share  for the year ended september  compared to million  or per share  for the year ended september  the increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the increased expenses described above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and cash flows as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products or other sources of revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated significant operating losses since we were incorporated in we have funded our research and development operations primarily through proceeds from our series a convertible preferred stock financing in and our mezzanine and series b convertible preferred stock financings in through december   we had received aggregate gross proceeds of million from these sales 
we received an aggregate of million from our initial public offering in may and follow on offering in february at september   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million 
to date  we have invested our excess funds primarily in managed money funds with two major financial institutions 
all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are categorized as cash equivalents 
we plan to continue to invest our cash and cash equivalents in accordance with our approved investment policy guidelines  which set forth our policy to hold investment securities to maturity 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended september  primarily reflects the net loss for the period  offset in part by stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization expenses and a decrease in income tax receivable  accounts payable  income tax payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in operations for the years ended september  and primarily reflects the net loss for the period  offset in part by depreciation  share base compensation and changes in accrued expenses  accounts payable and deferred compensation 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended september  primarily reflects sale of marketable securities partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended september  and primarily reflects the purchases of marketable securities  property and equipment and leasehold improvement costs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended september   million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects the proceeds from sale of stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds from our follow on public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflects proceeds from our initial public offering 
in july  we entered into a supply agreement with nv organon  which will terminate in december  to purchase specified minimum quantities of recombinant human insulin 
we anticipate that our minimum purchase requirements for the next nine consecutive quarters will total as much as million depending on our regulatory plans for viaject 
on february   we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share and received net proceeds from this offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses  of million 
certain of our stockholders sold  shares in the offering 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares from the selling stockholders 
on may   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the offering resulted in gross proceeds of million 
we received net proceeds from the offering of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and additional offering expenses 
the remaining net proceeds were invested in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  in accordance with our investment policy 
funding requirements we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures at least through the second quarter of fiscal year we have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
for example  if the fda were to require us to conduct an additional pivotal phase clinical trial of viaject  our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to complete that clinical development program 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  and to the extent that we may or may not enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to secure approval by the fda for viaject under section b of the ffdca  our ability to file our nda for viaject in december as planned and  once filed  the length of time that will elapse before our nda is fully reviewed by the fda  
table of contents the costs associated with preparing and submitting our maa for viaject to the emea  our ability to market  commercialize and achieve market acceptance for product candidates  particularly viaject  our ability to secure approval by the fda for viaject without conducting additional pivotal clinical trials  the fda s findings regarding data anomalies observed in india in our phase clinical trial of viaject for patients with type diabetes and the impact of those findings on the timing of a regulatory approval  the size  endpoints and duration of additional clinical trials of viaject in patients with type diabetes to support our commercialization efforts and  potentially  fda approval  the cost to fully develop the iu cc liquid formulation of viaject  our ability to establish that the iu cc liquid formulation of viaject is well tolerated in chronic use  the cost to develop an insulin pen program for use with viaject  the cost of purchasing recombinant human insulin and other materials to build commercial supply inventory for viaject  taking into account currency exchange rate fluctuations  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the cost associated with qualifying and obtaining regulatory approval of suppliers of insulin and manufacturers of our product candidates  our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and the terms and success of the collaborations  including the timing and amount of payments that we might receive from potential strategic collaborators  and the continued participation of patients in our viaject phase clinical trial extension program  which is designed to run through february we do not anticipate generating product revenue for the next few years 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several years 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we do not currently have any commitments for future external funding 
additional equity or debt financing or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain drug candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently or enter into corporate collaborations at a later stage of development 
in addition  any future equity funding will dilute the ownership of our equity investors 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase commitments total fixed contractual obligations recent accounting pronouncements effective october   the company adopted the provisions asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which substantially incorporates the fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  no 
 fair value measurements 
these provisions define fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expand disclosures about fair value measurements 
portions of these provisions have been deferred for one year for certain non financial assets and liabilities 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted the fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 amendments based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles the codification 
the codification became the single source of authoritative gaap in the united states  and other than rules and interpretive releases issued by the united states securities and exchange commission sec 
the codification reorganized generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  into a topical format that eliminates the previous gaap hierarchy and instead established two levels of guidance authoritative and nonauthoritative 
all non grandfathered  non sec accounting literature that was not included in the codification became nonauthoritative 
the adoption of the codification did not change previous gaap  but rather simplified user access to all authoritative literature related to a particular accounting topic in one place 
accordingly  the adoption had no impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
all prior references to previous gaap in the company s consolidated financial statements were updated for the new references under the codification 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  as permitted by the terms of our investment policy guidelines 
currently  our investments are primarily limited to highly liquid money market investments 
a portion of our investments may be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates were to increase 
the effective duration of our portfolio is currently less than one year  which we believe limits interest rate and credit risk 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure 
pursuant to our supply agreement with nv organon  our purchases of insulin are denominated in euros 
most of our other transactions are denominated in united states dollars and do not present a material exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
