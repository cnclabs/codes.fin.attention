item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview iris international  inc consists of three operating units in two business segments as determined in accordance with sfas our in vitro diagnostics  or ivd  segment also called iris diagnostics division  designs  manufactures and markets ivd systems  consumables and supplies for urinalysis and body fluids 
with the acquisition of leucadia technologies  inc  or leucadia  in we created iris molecular diagnostics  or imd  whose operations are included as part of the iris diagnostics division 
our sample processing segment markets small centrifuges and other processing equipment and accessories for rapid specimen processing 
the initial applications for our technology have been in the urinalysis market and we are the leading worldwide provider of urine microscopy systems  with more than  systems sold in over countries 
we generate revenues primarily from sales of ivd instruments  ivd consumables and service and sample processing instruments and supplies 
revenues from ivd instruments include sales of urine microscopy and chemistry analyzers manufactured by us and urine chemistry analyzers sourced from a japanese manufacturer 
we sell our urine microscopy analyzers worldwide and the ichem velocity  our fully automated chemistry analyzer internationally since september we currently distribute the japanese manufacturer s fully automated chemistry analyzers domestically  but upon clearance of our k pending with the fda for our ichem velocity  we will begin selling our chemistry analyzer in the united states 
consumables include products such as chemical reagents and urine test strips 
service revenues are derived primarily from annual service contracts purchased by our domestic customers after the initial year of sale  which is covered by product warranty and spare parts from international customers 
once the analyzers are installed  we generate recurring revenue from sales of consumables 
consumable and service revenue should continue to expand as the installed base of related instruments increases 
revenue is also generated from sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies  which primarily consists of centrifuge systems  dna processing workstations and blood analysis products 
domestic sales of our urinalysis systems are direct to the customer through our sales force 
international sales  with the exception of france which are sold direct to end use customers  are through independent distributors 
international sales represented of consolidated revenues during the year ended december  as compared to during the year ended december  international sales are made through independent distributors  gross profit margin is lower than domestic sales of the same products  but we do not incur sales and marketing costs for such sales 
our sample processing products are sold worldwide primarily through distributors 
in december  a manufacturing  supply and transition agreement was signed with idexx laboratories idexx 
a million non recurring net payment has been recorded as other income and does not impact revenue from operations 
this agreement allows idexx to manufacture and distribute rotors compatible with the drives of idexx machines 
during the second quarter of  we closed the operations of our advanced digital imaging research subsidiary  or adir  whose costs had previously been substantially covered by government sponsored grants 
while the closing of adir resulted in a one time charge of approximately  in the second quarter of  period expenses related to this operation decreased slightly and we no longer incur costs related to salaries and related overhead of this subsidiary 
on april  we acquired leucadia  now named iris molecular diagnostics  or imd  a development stage molecular diagnostics company 
with this acquisition  we acquired significant core technology for an ultra sensitive protein detection and novel in vitro separation and concentration process  as well as in process research and development for bacteria and cancer detection applications 
we have invested significant capital to acquire technologies and to increase our investment in research and development to advance our broad product pipeline in morphology  molecular diagnostics and sample 
table of contents processing 
research and development expense increased to million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in we believe these significant investments in research and development will continue to address the need for automation and improved clinical utility within the major market segments of the in vitro diagnostics market 
the following table summarizes product technology expenditures for the periods indicated in thousands total product technology expenditures during year less amounts capitalized during year to software development costs as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow less amounts reimbursed through grants for government sponsored research and development research and development expense as reported in the consolidated statements of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations require us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we regularly discuss with our audit committee the basis of our estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenues are primarily derived from the sale of ivd instruments  sales of consumable supplies and services for ivd systems as well as sales of sample processing instruments and related supplies 
revenue is recognized once all of the following conditions have been met i an authorized purchase order has been received in writing with a fixed and determinable sales price  ii customer credit worthiness has been established  and iii delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
revenue is recorded in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf statement revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements  which generally require revenue earned on product sales involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements if sold separately 
multiple elements of certain domestic product sales include ivd instruments  training  consumables and service 
accordingly  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the element s respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately and specifically defined in a quotation or contract 
a portion of our revenues are derived from sales type leases as we provide lease financing to certain customers that purchase our diagnostic instruments 
leases under these arrangements are classified as investment 
table of contents in sales type leases 
these leases typically have terms of five years 
revenue from sales type leases is recognized when collectibility of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable and no important uncertainties surround the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us as lessor under the lease 
the minimum lease payments that accrue to our benefit as lessor are recorded as the gross investment in the lease 
the difference between the gross investment in the lease and the sum of the present value of the minimum lease payments and unguaranteed residual value  accruing to our benefit as lessor  are recorded as unearned income 
we have certain government contracts with cancellation clauses or renewal provisions that are generally required by law  such as i those dependant on fiscal funding outside of a governmental unit s control  ii those that can be cancelled if deemed in the tax payers best interest  and iii those that must be renewed each fiscal year  given limitations that may exist on multi year contracts that are imposed by statute 
under these circumstances and in accordance with the relevant accounting literature  as well as considering our historical experience  a thorough evaluation of these contracts is performed to assess whether cancellation is remote or whether exercise of the renewal option is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues from service contracts ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally received in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels and future sales forecasts 
since the introduction of our iq product line  the installed base of our legacy analyzers have been steadily declining and less than units remain in use as of december  we maintain a base supply of service parts for these products 
management will periodically review the carrying value of such parts to ensure that they continue to equal or do not exceed net realizable value 
goodwill and core technology our intangible assets consist of goodwill  which is not being amortized and core technology  which is being amortized over its useful life of years 
all intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis 
goodwill is evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  based on various analyses  including a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value  cash flow and profitability projections 
the analysis necessarily involves significant management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
core technology is evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to a potential impairment 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long lived assets present in that operation 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  long lived assets  including such intangibles  are written down to their respective fair values 
at december   we evaluated goodwill and determined that fair value had not decreased below carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary in accordance with sfas no 
substantially all of the goodwill resides in the ivd reporting unit 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs in connection with our development of our urine analyzers in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the cost of capitalized software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
we capitalize software development costs once technological feasibility is established and such costs are determined to be recoverable against future revenues 
capitalized software development costs are expensed to cost of sales over periods up to five years 
when  in management s estimate  future revenues will not be sufficient to recover previously capitalized software development costs  we will expense such items as additional software development amortization in the period the 
table of contents impairment is identified 
such adjustments are normally attributable to changes in market conditions or product quality considerations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense represents the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which was issued in july fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest  penalties and disclosures required 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
stock based compensation effective january  we implemented the provisions of sfas no 
r that establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services or incurs a liability in exchange for goods and services that is based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
the primary focus of this pronouncement is on issuing share based payments for services provided by employees 
this pronouncement also requires recognition of compensation expense for new equity instruments awarded or for modifications  cancellations or repurchases of existing awards starting january  compensation expense for new equity awards will be based on the fair value of the stock on the date of grant and will be recognized over the vesting service period 
an award of a liability instrument  as defined by this pronouncement  will initially be recorded at fair value and will be adjusted each reporting period to the new fair value through the date of settlement 
under the terms of this pronouncement  we began to expense equity awards using a modified version of prospective application 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes results of operations data for the periods indicated 
the percentages in the table are based on total revenues with the exception of percentages for gross profit margins which are computed on related revenue 
year ended december  in thousands revenues ivd instruments ivd consumables and service sample processing instruments and supplies total revenues gross profit ivd instruments ivd consumable and service sample processing instruments and supplies gross profit operating expenses marketing and selling general and administrative research and development  net total operating expenses operating income other income expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss gross profit margin percentages are based on the related sales of each category 
income tax percentage is computed based on the relationship of income taxes to pre tax income 
during  we acquired in process research and development amounting to million which is not deductible for tax purposes 
comparison of year ended december  to revenues for the year ended december  increased by over the prior year to million from million in revenues in the ivd urinalysis segment increased to million in  from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments increased to million from million in the prior year 
our unit volume of iq analyzers sold during increased approximately with the number of units sold domestically remaining constant whereas the number of units sold internationally increased 
domestically  we sell the iq microscopy analyzers separately or combined with an automated chemistry analyzer that we acquire from a japanese company 
the majority of our domestic sales are sold as combined systems 
internationally  we sell our iq microscopy analyzer and ichem velocity automated chemistry analyzer separately or combined as an iricell workstation since the release of the ichem velocity in september total international revenues accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue during compared to during sales of ivd consumables and service increased during the year to million from million  an increase of over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments and the success of converting expiring warranty agreements to service agreements 
revenues from the sample 
table of contents processing instruments and supplies increased to million up from million  a increase over this growth was primarily driven by the new express centrifuge partially offset by declining sales of more mature products  such as the express centrifuge 
overall gross profit margins increased from in to in the gross profit margin of our ivd instruments was in versus in  as the launch of our recently introduced ichem velocity carries higher start up manufacturing costs such as manufacturing learning curve  training and higher material costs due to small lot procurement in the initial stages 
in addition  our gross margins on ivd instruments were negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations on purchases of arkray s chemistry analyzers which are denominated in japanese yen 
the gross margin of our ivd consumables and service increased to during compared to in the consumable gross margin improvement primarily resulted from economies of scale generated by our increasing volume of urine microscopy consumables partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations on purchases of dry chemistry strips denominated in japanese yen 
our chemistry strip manufacturing operation continues to operate below capacity  but we expect to improve its utilization with increased demand for our proprietary urine chemistry test strips as a result of an increasing installed base our new ichem velocity automated urine chemistry analyzers in the mid to high volume segment of the urinalysis market 
in addition  we experienced gross profit margin improvement in our domestic instrument service as a result of economies of scale and cost containments even with an increasing domestic installed base 
gross profit margin for our sample processing laboratory instruments and supplies segment remained constant at in and marketing and selling expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase includes additional personnel and related costs of million  primarily relating to new product introductions  and professional and gpo fees of  and other expenses of  general and administrative expenses amounted to million  or of revenues  in  as compared to million or of revenues in this increase includes additional personnel and related costs of million most of which is attributed to a significant investment in information technology staff needed to improve our business systems 
in addition  our board compensation expense and corporate insurance increased by  and other corporate expenses increased by  partially offset by a reduction in professional fees for audit and sox services of  research and development expense for the year ended amounted to million and the year ended amounted to million 
the increase includes million in personnel and related expenses  and an increase in clinical development related expenses of  these costs were partially offset by a reduction in ichem velocity prototype and research materials totaling  a decrease in consultants  patent prosecution and other miscellaneous expenses  primarily related to the ichem velocity development of  and cost reductions as a result of the shutdown of adir of  interest income during amounted to million  a  decrease over mainly due to a lower interest rate environment on our cash balances  which our cash balances are lower due to the repurchase of our common stock during the year under our stock repurchase plans 
income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the increase in the income tax provision resulted from a reduction in research and development tax credits and the release of valuation allowance in the prior year 
we have federal and state research and development and other tax credit carryovers totaling million 
other income from non recurring manufacturing transition rights of million during related to an agreement entered with idexx operations  inc idexx  in december this manufacturing  supply and transition agreement allows idexx to manufacture and distribute rotors compatible with the drives of idexx 
table of contents machines  and in exchange for the manufacturing transition rights  we received million with an offset of  related to costs associated with the manufacturing transition rights 
comparison of year ended december  to revenues for the year ended december  increased by over the prior year to million from million in revenues in the ivd urinalysis segment increased to million in  from million in the prior year 
sales of ivd instruments increased to million from million in the prior year 
our unit volume of instruments sold during increased approximately with the number of units sold domestically remaining constant whereas the number of units sold internationally increased 
domestically  we sell the iq microscopy analyzers separately or combined with an automated chemistry analyzer we acquire from a japanese company 
the majority of domestic sales are sold as combined systems which carry a much higher average selling price 
internationally  we sell our iq microscopy analyzer separately or with our semi automated chemistry analyzer  as we do not have the distribution rights for the fully automated chemistry analyzer 
in we launched a fully automated chemistry analyzer  the ichem velocity that was developed internally 
total international revenues accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue during compared to during sales of ivd consumables and service increased during the year to million from million  an increase of over  primarily due to the larger installed base of instruments and the success of converting warranty agreements to service agreements 
in addition  we continue to service and support the installed base of legacy systems discontinued in revenues from the sample processing instruments and supplies increased to million up from million  a increase over as this business segment has increased in almost all of its core express product lines 
overall gross profit margins increased from in to in the gross profit margin of our ivd instruments was in and  as our increased unit volume was derived almost entirely from the sale of lower margin international units 
the gross margin of our ivd consumables and services increased to during compared to in the increase resulted from the continued leveraging of our german chemistry strip manufacturing operation  although it continues to operate below capacity until we launch of our new automated urine chemistry analyzer in in addition  gross profit margin improvement can be attributed to cost improvements in our services area 
gross profit margin for our sample processing laboratory instrument and supply segment increased from in to as a result of increased volume and cost saving initiatives 
marketing and selling expenses totaled million  or of revenues  in as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase includes additional personnel and related costs of million  higher commissions of  and higher fees paid to gpos of  general and administrative expenses amounted to million for both and this year we experienced increases in professional fees for audit and legal services of  and additional facility costs of  both years experienced finance department related restructuring costs  however during the year ended december   we reduced  of personnel related costs as a result of this transition 
research and development expense for the year ended amounted to and the year ended amounted to million of which million represents the purchased in process research and development expenses booked in the second quarter of relating to the acquisition of leucadia technologies  inc the year ended includes the cost of closing down the adir subsidiary  which amounted to approximately  our spending in  excluding the purchased in process research and development  increased by million and included higher payroll and related costs of  increased facility costs of  and incremental materials and supplies spending for our new chemistry analyzer amounting to  these costs were partially offset by incremental capitalized software development expenditures of  relating to our new products 
research and development expenses were net of reimbursed costs received by governmental grants from our adir subsidiary  which amounted to  and million for the and  respectively 

table of contents interest income during amounted to million  a  increase over and relates to our continued investment of excess cash during the year as well as interest earned on lease financing from the sale of instruments to customers 
our sales type lease financings increased to million at december  compared to million the prior year 
income tax expense during the year amounted to of pre tax income as compared to during the prior year 
the decrease in the income tax provision resulted from the exclusion of million for purchased in process research and development not deductible for tax purposes in the prior year 
the tax provision continues to be primarily a non cash expense  since we have significant deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
our federal tax loss carryforward amounts to approximately million as of december  in addition  we also have research and development and other tax credit carryovers totaling million  net of valuation allowances 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates our expected minimum contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease commitments not included in the table above are normal recurring accounts payable or accrued expenses which are presented on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our ivd instruments  consumables and service  as well as sales of sample processing instruments and supplies 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents amounted to million compared to million at december  adverse macro economic forces have been impacting our selling markets and the credit markets of our customers 
although the impact thus far has been relatively mild  we continue to face the following challenges deferrals of purchases due to decreases in capital budgets of our customers  delays in the purchasing cycle due to greater scrutiny of deals and increased internal competition for limited capital dollars  and a significant increase in requests for quotes for operating leases 
the aforementioned factors may lead to a decrease in revenue  an increase of deferred revenue  or could lead to installment cash collections that will affect our liquidity and capital resources 
operating cash flows 
cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december  improved to million compared to cash provided by operations of million during the prior year 
in addition to a net income increase of million  our improvement includes non cash items consisting of higher depreciation and amortization of  and tax benefits from stock option exercises of  in addition  cash flow 
table of contents was positively impacted by a million reduction in inventories   reduction in investment in sales type leases  an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a  increase in deferred service contract revenue 
we experienced a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in prepaid expense and other current assets which offset the positive cash flow 
the sources of cash were partially offset by a decrease of deferred taxes of  the number of days sales in accounts receivable increased to days at the end of compared to days for the prior year end 
the number of days sales in accounts receivable varies and extends due to the greater volume of international customers 
our cash flow has been favorably affected by tax credit carry forwards and tax loss carry forwards 
as of december   we have federal and state tax credit carry forwards of million and million  respectively  net of valuation allowances 
we continue to realize tax deductions from the exercise of certain stock options 
during the year ended december   we realized cumulative excess tax deductions of approximately million relating to this item 
during the year ended december   we paid federal and state taxes of million and  respectively 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in  a million increase over the prior year period primarily as a result of our purchase of short term marketable securities of million with a partial offset of a  decrease in purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities totaled million during the year ended december   primarily from the repurchase of common stock for retirement in the amount of million and a reduction in tax deduction benefits from the exercise of stock options of  with an offset being the issuance of common stock of  over the prior year 
we currently have a credit facility with a commercial bank  which was renewed in may  consisting of a million revolving line of credit for working capital and a million line of credit for acquisitions and product opportunities 
the credit facility has variable interest rates  which will change from time to time based on changes to either the libor rate or the lender s prime rate 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the new credit facility 
we are subject to certain financial and non financial covenants under the credit facility with the bank and as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
in november  we filed with the securities and exchange commission a shelf registration statement on form s  which allows us to sell up to million in common stock  preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
in december  the shelf registration statement was declared effective 
as of december   no securities had been issued pursuant to this registration statement 
on march   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase and retirement plan of up to million of our common stock over a month period 
under this plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately  on july   our board of directors terminated the share repurchase and retirement plan 
on november   our board of directors authorized a second share repurchase and retirement plan of up to million of our common stock over a month period 
as of december   under this second plan  we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately on september   our chief executive officer exercised a stock option to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share  on a net issue basis in a transaction approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors 
we issued  shares of common stock to our chief executive officer  and retained  shares of common stock with an aggregate market value of  based on the last closing price of our common stock immediately prior to exercise of per share 
of this amount   was applied in payment of the aggregate exercise price of the stock options and 
table of contents  was applied in payment of payroll taxes arising from the option exercise 
these options had a term expiring on november  we believe that our current cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and cash available under the credit facility with the bank will be sufficient to fund normal operations 
however  additional funding may be required to fund expansion of our business 
there is no assurance that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  except for the measurement of share based payments 
sfas was effective for the company on january  however  in february  the fasb released fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements other than the disclosures required by sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in our annual report on from k for the year ended december  the adoption of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  effective january   is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  which replaces sfas no the statement retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in the purchase accounting 
it also changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requires the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
sfas no 
r is effective for us beginning july  and will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after that date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb  which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests 
minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and  upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning july  and will apply prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 
sfas 
this statement changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires us to provide enhance disclosures about a how and why we use derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective prospectively for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no

the intent of fsp sfas is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r and other applicable accounting literature 
fsp sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
we will evaluate the potential impact of fsp sfas on acquisitions on a prospective basis 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
this is intended to improve financial reporting by indentifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap 
this statement will be effective days following the us securities and exchange commission s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendment to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
currently  there is no impact of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our business is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not invest in derivatives  foreign currency forward contracts or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we had no debt at december   thus were not subject to market risk for changes in interest rates on debt obligations 
we are subject to market risk for changes in interest rates on our short term investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in certificates of deposit and other short term investments  and the market value of these investments fluctuate based on changes in interest rates 
foreign currencies we conduct business in certain foreign markets  primarily in the european union and asia 
our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
we are subject to certain foreign currency risks in the importation of goods from japan and as a result of commercial operations in europe and asia 
our purchases from a major japanese ivd supplier are denominated in japanese yen 
these components represent a significant portion of our material costs 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars with the exception of france  where sales are denominated in euros 
fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate for japanese yen and euros could result in increased costs for our key components and increased costs for commercial operations in europe 
to mitigate the potential impact of adverse fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate for these currencies  we periodically purchase foreign currency forward contracts 
during the year ended december   we entered into such contracts for euros and japanese yen totaling  and million  respectively 
as of december   we do not have any remaining foreign currency forward contracts in japanese yen or euros 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships
