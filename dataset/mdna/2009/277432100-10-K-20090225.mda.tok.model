forward looking statements and risk factors this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements for eastman chemical company eastman or the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted gaap in the united states  and should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap  the company s management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to impairment of long lived assets  environmental costs  us pension and other post employment benefits  litigation and contingent liabilities  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition and results 
these estimates require management s most significant judgments in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company believes  based on historical results  the likelihood of actual write offs having a material impact on financial results or earnings per share is low 
however  if one of the company s key customers were to file for bankruptcy  or otherwise be unable to make its required payments  or there was a significant continued slow down in the economy  the company could be forced to increase its allowances 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
the company s allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the asset  adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used  significant changes in business conditions  or current or projected cash flow losses associated with the use of the assets 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
for long lived assets to be held and used  fair value of fixed tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets is determined primarily using either the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved or an appraisal 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale or other than by sale  fair value is determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment and require reporting units to be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is considered impaired when their fair value  as established by appraisal or based on undiscounted future cash flows of certain related products  is less than their carrying value 
the company conducts its annual testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in the third quarter of each year  unless events warrant more frequent testing 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles primarily consist of goodwill in the chemicals  adhesives  specialty polymers and inks caspi segment  which has maintained earnings through the second half of as such  recent events did not warrant retesting 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as the company s assumptions related to long lived assets are subject to change  additional write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted  resulting in a charge to earnings 
the company recognized no fixed tangible asset impairment costs and no definite lived intangible asset impairment costs in results from continuing operations during the company recognized fixed tangible asset impairment costs of million and definite lived intangible asset impairment costs of million in results from continuing operations during environmental costs the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas no 
the company also establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains 
environmental assets  as defined in sfas no 
 include but are not limited to waste management units  such as landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on an expected life of the environmental assets and the applicable regulatory closure requirements 
these future expenses are charged against earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
currently  the company estimates the useful life of each individual asset is up to years 
if the company changes its estimate of the asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets  expenses to be charged against earnings could increase or decrease 
in accordance with interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  the company also monitors conditional obligations and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs 
the company s reserve was million at december  and million at december   representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date over the regulated assets estimated useful lives for asset retirement obligation costs 
pension and other post employment benefits the company maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits 
additionally  eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates and expected return on plan assets 
for the us  at december   the company assumed a discount rate of percent on its defined benefit pension plan  percent on its other post employment benefit plan and an expected return on assets of percent 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company expects its pension expense to be similar to the december  projected benefit obligation and expense are affected by year end assumptions 
the sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted 
they also may not be additive  so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the company s long term assumptions in the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate for the us pension plan and other postretirement welfare plans change in assumption impact on pre tax us benefits expense impact on december  projected benefit obligation for us pension plan impact on december  benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans basis point decrease in discount rate million million million basis point increase in discount rate million million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million no impact n a basis point increase in expected return on assets million no impact n a the expected return on assets and assumed discount rate used to calculate the company s pension and other post employment benefit obligations are established each december the expected return on assets is based upon the long term expected returns in the markets in which the pension trust invests its funds  primarily the domestic  international  and private equity markets 
historically  the company has achieved an actual return which was equal to or greater than the expected return on assets 
however  due to the global recession in  the actual returns for were below expected returns 
the assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high grade corporate bonds  which are used to develop a yield curve 
this yield curve is applied to the expected durations of the pension and post employment benefit obligations 
as future benefits under the us benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount  changes in the health care trend assumptions do not have a material impact on the results of operations 
the company uses the market related valuation method to determine the value of plan assets  which recognizes the change of the fair value of the plan assets over five years 
if actual experience differs from these long term assumptions  the difference is recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain loss and then amortized into earnings over a period of time based on the average future service period  which may cause the expense related to providing these benefits to increase or decrease 
the charges applied to earnings in   and due to the amortization of these unrecognized actuarial losses  largely due to actual experience versus assumptions of discount rates  were million  million  and million  respectively 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company does not anticipate that a change in pension and other post employment obligations caused by a change in the assumed discount rate during will impact the cash contributions to be made to the pension plans during however  an after tax charge or credit will be recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  as of december  for the impact on the pension s projected benefit obligation of the change in interest rates  if any 
while the amount of the change in these obligations does not correspond directly to cash funding requirements  it is an indication of the amount the company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years 
the amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates  actual returns on plan assets  retirement  attrition rates of employees  and other factors 
for further information regarding pension and other post employment obligations  see note  retirement plans  to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  the company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
the company expenses legal costs  including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency  as incurred 
based upon facts and information currently available  the company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by monetary damages  costs or expenses  and charges against earnings in particular periods 
income taxes the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the ability to realize the deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and statement of financial position 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million has been provided against the deferred tax assets 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
 the company recognizes income tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold and accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions which is recorded as a component of the income tax provision 
prior to  the company determined tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the company recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations strategic actions and related presentation of non gaap financial measures during and  the company took strategic actions in its performance polymers segment to address its underperforming polyethylene terephthalate pet manufacturing facilities outside the united states 
in second quarter  the company completed the sale of its pet manufacturing facility in spain and in first quarter  the company completed the sale of its pet polymers and purified terephthalic acid pta manufacturing facilities in the netherlands and the pet manufacturing facility in the united kingdom and related businesses 
results from  charges related to  and gains and losses from disposal of the spain  the netherlands  and the united kingdom assets and businesses are presented as discontinued operations 
in fourth quarter  the company completed the sale of its mexico and argentina manufacturing facilities 
as part of this divestiture  the company entered into transition supply agreements for polymer intermediates 
in order to provide a better understanding of the impact on performance polymers segment results of the divested latin american pet assets  this management s discussion and analysis includes certain financial measures with and without sales and operating results in latin america from pet manufacturing facilities and related businesses in mexico and argentina and with and without contract polymer intermediates sales 
in fourth quarter  the company sold its polyethylene pe and epolenetm polymer businesses and related assets of the performance polymers and caspi segments 
as part of the pe divestiture  the company entered into a transition supply agreement for contract ethylene sales  from which sales revenue and operating earnings are included in the performance chemicals and intermediates pci segment results in and also in fourth quarter  the company made strategic decisions relating to the scheduled shutdown of cracking units in longview  texas and a planned shutdown of higher cost pet assets in columbia  south carolina 
accelerated depreciation costs resulting from these decisions were million and million in and  respectively 
for more information on accelerated depreciation costs  see gross profit in the results of operations section of this management s discussion and analysis 
in  the company sold certain mineral rights at an operating manufacturing site  recognizing million of other operating income 
this management s discussion and analysis includes the following non gaap financial measures and accompanying reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
the non gaap financial measures used by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with gaap 
company sales and segment sales and results from continuing operations excluding sales revenue and results from continuing operations from sales in latin america of pet products manufactured at the divested mexico and argentina pet manufacturing sites  company and segment sales excluding contract ethylene sales under a transition agreement related to the divestiture of the pe product lines  company and segment sales excluding contract polymer intermediates sales under a transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the pet manufacturing facilities and related businesses in mexico and argentina  company and segment gross profit  operating earnings and earnings from continuing operations excluding accelerated depreciation costs  asset impairments and restructuring charges  and other operating income  and company earnings from continuing operations excluding net deferred tax benefits related to the previous divestiture of businesses 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations eastman s management believes that contract ethylene sales under the transition agreement related to the divestiture of the pe product lines  the contract polymer intermediates sales under the transition supply agreement related to the divestiture of the pet manufacturing facilities and related businesses in mexico and argentina  and the other operating income from the sale of mineral rights do not reflect the continuing and expected future business of the pci and performance polymers segments or of the company 
in addition  for evaluation and analysis of ongoing business results and of the impact on the company and segments of strategic decisions and actions to reduce costs and to improve the profitability of the company  management believes that company and segment earnings from continuing operations should be considered both with and without accelerated depreciation costs  asset impairments and restructuring charges  and deferred tax benefits related to the previous divestiture of businesses  and that company and segment sales and results from continuing operations should be considered both with and without sales revenue and results from continuing operations from sales in latin america of pet products manufactured at the divested mexico and argentina manufacturing facilities 
management believes that investors can better evaluate and analyze historical and future business trends if they also consider the reported company and segment results  respectively  without the identified items 
management utilizes company and segment results including and excluding the identified items in the measures it uses to evaluate business performance and in determining certain performance based compensation 
these measures  excluding the identified items  are not recognized in accordance with gaap and should not be viewed as alternatives to the gaap measures of performance 
overview the company generated sales revenue of billion for compared to billion for excluding the results of contract ethylene sales  contract polymer intermediates sales  and sales from divested pet facilities in mexico and argentina  sales revenue increased by percent 
the sales revenue increase was due to increased selling prices in response to higher raw material and energy costs more than offsetting lower sales volume 
although the company had some volume decline through the first nine months compared to first nine months  in addition to normal seasonality  eastman s sales volumes had an unprecedented drop in fourth quarter due to the global recession 
operating earnings were million in compared to million in excluding accelerated depreciation costs  asset impairments and restructuring charges and other operating income  operating earnings were million in compared with million in the company had strong results  despite eastman  and the chemical industry as a whole  facing unprecedented declines in demand  particularly in fourth quarter  extremely volatile raw material and energy costs and an uncertain global economy 
the lower full year operating earnings were driven by the year over year decline in fourth quarter results  primarily due to the sharp deterioration in demand 
this decline in demand caused lower sales volume and historically low capacity utilization which resulted in higher unit costs 
these challenges resulted in lower than anticipated operating margins for the majority of the segments and the company as a whole 
primarily as a result of strategic actions related to the performance polymers and pci segments  as well as a corporate severance program  operating earnings in were negatively impacted by million in asset impairments and restructuring charges and million of accelerated depreciation costs  and were positively impacted by million in other operating income 
operating earnings in were negatively impacted by million in asset impairments and restructuring charges and million of accelerated depreciation costs 
asset impairments and restructuring charges for were primarily related to the divestiture of the company s mexico and argentina pet manufacturing sites 
earnings from continuing operations increased by million for as compared to excluding accelerated depreciation costs and asset impairments and restructuring charges  net  earnings from continuing operations were million and million  respectively 
earnings from continuing operations for compared to benefited from a lower effective tax rate 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company generated million in cash from operating activities during compared to million generated by operating activities in the difference was primarily due to a more challenging economic environment resulting in lower net earnings excluding accelerated depreciation and asset impairments and restructuring charges 
in  the company contributed million to its us defined benefit pension plan and did not make any contributions in in  the company received proceeds from sales of assets and investments of million  repurchased shares totaling million  and repaid million of borrowings 
the company believes that cash balances  cash flows from operations  and external sources of liquidity will be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash flow requirements 
as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn million committed revolving credit facility the credit facility 
the credit facility is substantially available through  is supported by a diverse group of banks  and can be drawn for general corporate purposes 
the company is currently in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
in addition  there are no material debt maturities until the company believes the combination of cash from operations  manageable leverage  and committed external sources of liquidity provides a solid financial foundation that positions it well in the current volatile economic and financial environments 
in addition to the completion of the sale of its pet polymers and pta manufacturing facilities in the netherlands and the pet manufacturing facility in the united kingdom in first quarter  actions to improve the performance of its performance polymers segment including the transformation at the south carolina facility 
in the fibers segment  the company completed the acetate tow capacity expansion in the united kingdom and announced a cellulose acetate tow alliance in korea 
eastman continued to progress on its strategic growth initiatives including the industrial gasification project in the us gulf coast and 
in june  as part of the progression on the gasification project in beaumont  texas  the company acquired entire ownership interest in tx energy  llc tx energy for approximately million  which is primarily allocated to properties and equipment 
front end engineering and design for the project is planned to be completed by mid the company is pursuing non recourse project financing utilizing the department of energy s federal loan guarantee program and its completed application was submitted in november in  the company completed the purchase of an idled methanol and ammonia plant in beaumont  texas from terra industries inc and intends to restart these facilities using raw materials supplied via pipeline from the nearby gasification facility  once the gasification facility is complete 
in december  the company announced an alliance with sk chemicals company ltd 
sk to form a company to acquire and operate a cellulose acetate tow manufacturing facility and related business  with the facility to be constructed by sk in korea 
eastman will have majority ownership and will operate the facility 
construction began in first quarter and is expected to be completed during second quarter annual capacity at the site is expected to be approximately  metric tons and eastman s total worldwide capacity for acetate tow is expected to exceed  metric tons  an increase of percent 
the impact on global capacity is estimated to be an increase of approximately two percent

in addition  the company has evaluated long term purchase obligations with an entity that may be a vie at december  this potential vie is a joint venture from which the company has purchased raw materials and utilities for several years and purchases approximately million of raw materials and utilities on an annual basis 
the company has no equity interest in this entity and has confirmed that one party to this joint venture does consolidate the potential vie 
however  due to competitive and other reasons  the company has not been able to obtain the necessary financial information to determine whether the entity is a vie  and whether or not the company is the primary beneficiary 
guarantees and claims also arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with suppliers  customers  and non consolidated affiliates when the company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others  if specified triggering events occur 
non performance under a contract could trigger an obligation of the company 
these potential claims include actions based upon alleged exposures to products  intellectual property and environmental matters  and other indemnifications 
the ultimate effect on future financial results is not subject to reasonable estimation because considerable uncertainty exists as to the final outcome of these claims 
however  while the ultimate liabilities resulting from such claims may be significant to results of operations in the period recognized  management does not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity

dividends the company declared quarterly cash dividends of per share for a total of per share in   and the company has declared a cash dividend of per share during the first quarter of  payable on april  to stockholders of record on march  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental certain eastman manufacturing sites generate hazardous and nonhazardous wastes of which the treatment  storage  transportation  and disposal are regulated by various governmental agencies 
in connection with the cleanup of various hazardous waste sites  the company  along with many other entities  has been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the us environmental protection agency under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  which potentially subjects prps to joint and several liability for such cleanup costs 
in addition  the company will be required to incur costs for environmental remediation and closure and postclosure under the federal resource conservation and recovery act 
reserves for environmental contingencies have been established in accordance with eastman s policies as described in note  significant accounting policies  to the company s consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
because of expected sharing of costs  the availability of legal defenses  and the company s preliminary assessment of actions that may be required  it does not believe its liability for these environmental matters  individually or in the aggregate  will be material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company accrues environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
this undiscounted accrued amount reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental expenditures for remediation costs range from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  in addition to remediation activities  the company establishes reserves for closure postclosure costs associated with the environmental assets it maintains 
environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units  such as landfills  water treatment facilities  and ash ponds 
when these types of assets are constructed or installed  a reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements 
these future expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets 
fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the interpretation also clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation caro refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the company performed a thorough examination of various asset categories 
although it may have caros at certain of its facilities  including  but not limited to  the potential for asbestos abatement activities  the company is unable to determine potential settlement dates to be used in fair value calculations for estimating these obligations as a result of an absence of plans or expectations to undertake a major renovation or demolition project that would require the removal of asbestos 
the company continues to monitor these conditional obligations  as well as any new ones that may develop  and will record reserves associated with them when and to the extent that more detailed information becomes available concerning applicable retirement costs 
the recorded obligations did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reserves related to environmental assets accounted for approximately percent of the total environmental reserve at december  currently  the company s environmental assets are expected to reach the end of their useful lives at different times over the next years 
if the company were to invest in numerous new environmental assets  or  these assets were to require closure a significant number of years before the company anticipated they would  the amortization on them would increase  and could have a material negative impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company views the likelihood of this occurrence to be remote  and does not anticipate  based on its past experience with this type of planned remediation  that an additional accrual related to environmental assets will be necessary 
the company s cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
these amounts were primarily for operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities  but also included expenditures for construction and development 
the company does not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of recently promulgated environmental laws and regulations to materially increase the company s planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities 
inflation in recent years  general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on eastman s costs 
the cost of raw materials is generally based on market price  although derivative financial instruments were utilized  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market price fluctuations 
the volatility of raw material and energy costs will continue and the company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit

see forward looking statements and risk factors below 
forward looking statements and risk factors the expectations under outlook and certain other statements in this annual report on form k may be forward looking in nature as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements and other written and oral forward looking statements made by the company from time to time may relate to  among other things  such matters as planned and expected capacity increases and utilization  anticipated capital spending  expected depreciation and amortization  environmental matters  legal proceedings  exposure to  and effects of hedging of  raw material and energy costs  foreign currencies and interest rates  global and regional economic  political  and business conditions  competition  growth opportunities  supply and demand  volume  price  cost  margin  and sales  earnings  cash flow  dividends and other expected financial results and conditions  expectations  strategies  and plans for individual assets and products  businesses and segments as well as for the whole of eastman chemical company  cash requirements and uses of available cash  financing plans  pension expenses and funding  credit ratings  anticipated restructuring  divestiture  and consolidation activities  cost reduction and control efforts and targets  integration of acquired businesses  strategic initiatives and development  production  commercialization  and acceptance of new products  services and technologies and related costs  asset  business and product portfolio changes  and expected tax rates and net interest costs 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations these plans and expectations are based upon certain underlying assumptions  including those mentioned with the specific statements 
such assumptions are in turn based upon internal estimates and analyses of current market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  economic conditions and other factors 
these plans and expectations and the assumptions underlying them are necessarily subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future conditions and results 
actual results could differ materially from expectations expressed in the forward looking statements if one or more of the underlying assumptions and expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized 
in addition to the factors described elsewhere in this annual report  the following are some of the important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements conditions in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the company s business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by the global recession  including the credit market crisis  declining consumer and business confidence  fluctuating commodity prices  volatile exchange rates  and other challenges currently affecting the global economy 
the company s customers may experience deterioration of their businesses  cash flow shortages  and difficulty obtaining financing 
as a result  existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion 
further  suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions  which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to the company 
if the global recession continues for significant future periods or deteriorates significantly  the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
in addition  natural disasters  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the company operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw material and energy commodities  or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities  could affect availability and costs of raw material and energy commodities 
while temporary shortages of raw material and energy may occasionally occur  these items have historically been sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements 
however  their continuous availability and price are impacted by natural disasters  plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand  domestic and world market and political conditions  changes in government regulation  war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism  and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure 
eastman s operations or products may  at times  be adversely affected by these factors 
the company s competitive position in the markets in which it participates is  in part  subject to external factors in addition to those that the company can impact 
natural disasters  pandemic illnesses  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the company operates or does business or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials  and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw material and energy supplies to the company and for delivery of the company s products to customers  could negatively impact the company s competitive position and its ability to maintain market share 
for example  supply and demand for certain of the company s products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which  in turn  impact demand for and pricing of the company s products 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations limitation of the company s available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations  including natural disasters  pandemic illnesses  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the company operates or does business  or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of raw material and energy supplies to the company and for delivery of the company s products to customers  could have a material adverse affect on sales revenue  costs and results of operations and financial condition 
the company has an extensive customer base  however  loss of  or material financial weakness of  certain of the largest customers could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced and no assurances can be made that the company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers 
the company has efforts underway to exploit growth opportunities in certain core businesses by developing new products and technologies  licensing technologies  expanding into new markets  and tailoring product offerings to customer needs 
current examples include integrextm technology and new pet polymers products and tritantm and other copolyester product innovations 
there can be no assurance that such efforts will result in financially successful commercialization of such products or acceptance by existing or new customers or new markets or that large capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due  among other things  to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor 
the company has made  and intends to continue making  strategic investments  including in industrial gasification  and has entered  and expects to continue to enter  into strategic alliances in technology  services businesses  and other ventures in order to build  diversify  and strengthen certain eastman capabilities  improve eastman s raw material and energy cost and supply position  and maintain high utilization of manufacturing assets 
there can be no assurance that such investments and alliances will achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the company s results of operations or that large capital projects for such growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due  among other things  to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers 
such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from these strategic investments and projects 
the company anticipates obtaining non recourse project financing for its industrial gasification project 
there is risk that such financing cannot be obtained or  if obtained  may be on terms different than those assumed in the company s projections for financial performance of the project  due to any circumstance  change  or condition in the loan syndication  financial  capital markets  or government loan guarantee programs  that could reasonably be expected to materially affect availability  terms  and syndication of such financing 
the ability to enter into financially acceptable project commercial agreements for such elements as engineering  procurement  and construction  off take agreements  commodity and or interest hedges  utilities  administrative services  and others  as well as obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals and operating permits  may impact the available financing for the project or the terms of such financing  if available  including the nature and terms of any recourse back to the company 
in addition to productivity and cost reduction initiatives  the company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases where warranted and accepted by the market  however  the company s earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized  not be sufficient to cover increased raw material and energy costs  or have a negative impact on demand and volume 
there can be no assurances that price increases will be realized or will be realized within the company s anticipated timeframe 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company has undertaken and expects to continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
the company s facilities and businesses are subject to complex health  safety and environmental laws and regulations  which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future 
the company s accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based 
the amount accrued reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  chemical control regulations  and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
the company and its operations from time to time are parties to  or targets of  lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  asbestos  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company 
the company has deferred tax assets related to capital and operating losses 
the company establishes valuation allowances to reduce these deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company s ability to utilize these deferred tax assets depends on projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  and the availability of tax planning strategies 
realization of these assets is expected to occur over an extended period of time 
as a result  changes in tax laws  assumptions with respect to future taxable income  and tax planning strategies could result in adjustments to these assets 
due to the company s global sales  earnings  and asset profile  it is exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company may use derivative financial instruments  including swaps  options and forwards  to mitigate the impact of changes in exchange rates and interest rates on its financial results 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful and operating results could be affected by significant adverse changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s sources of liquidity have been and are expected to be cash from operating activities  available cash balances  the revolving million credit facility  sales of domestic receivables under the million accounts receivable securitization program  the commercial paper market  and the capital markets 
additionally  the company relies upon third parties to provide it with trade credit for purchases of various products and services 
while the company maintains business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions  their continued viability is not certain and could lead them not to honor their contractual credit commitments or to renew their extensions of credit or provide new sources of credit 
furthermore  trade creditors may be unable to obtain credit and reduce their trade credit extension 
recently  the capital and credit markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the failure or near failure of a number of large financial services companies 
if the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited  the company may incur increased costs associated with borrowings 
in addition  it is possible that the company s ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when it would like  or need  to do so  which could have an impact on the company s ability to finance its business or react to changing economic and business conditions 
while the company believes that recent governmental and regulatory actions reduce the risk of a further deterioration or systemic contraction of capital and credit markets  there can be no certainty that the company s liquidity will not be negatively impacted 
company borrowings are subject to a number of customary covenants and events of default  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
while the company expects to remain in compliance with such covenants  there is no certainty that events and circumstances will not result in covenant violations which could limit access to credit facilities or cause events of default with outstanding borrowings 
in addition  the company s cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable consequences to the company s customers and the markets in which the company competes as a result of the current financial  economic  and capital and credit market conditions and uncertainty 
the foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors nor necessarily present them in order of importance 
this disclosure  including that under outlook and forward looking statements and risk factors  and other forward looking statements and related disclosures made by the company in this annual report on form k and elsewhere from time to time  represents management s best judgment as of the date the information is given 
the company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise  except as required by law 
investors are advised  however  to consult any further public company disclosures such as in filings with the securities and exchange commission or in company press releases on related subjects 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding foreign operations 
to mitigate the company s exposure to these market risks  eastman has established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis  which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and or commodity prices 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities  which include long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements 
currently  these borrowings and investments are predominately us dollar denominated 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions  and other factors 
for purposes of calculating the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  the company uses a one percent or less absolute shift in interest rates 
for and  the market risks associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  assuming an instantaneous absolute shift in interest rates of one percent or less were approximately million and million  respectively 
this exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates 
the company s operating cash flows and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business 
in order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk  the company enters into currency options to hedge probable anticipated  but not yet committed  export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than five years and denominated in foreign currencies  and forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
for  the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately million and an additional million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates 
for  the market risks associated with borrowings denominated in foreign currencies assuming a percent adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency was approximately million and an additional million for each additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency rates 
furthermore  since the company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials and energy 
to mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities  principally propane and natural gas  the company enters into option and forward contracts 
for  there was limited market risk associated with options and forwards for these same commodities 
for  the market risk associated with forwards and options for feedstock and natural gas  assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of percent  was million and an additional million for each one percentage point move in closing price thereafter
