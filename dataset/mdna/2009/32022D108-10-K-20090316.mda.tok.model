item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the major elements of our balance sheets and statements of income 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview we operate banking centers in eight contiguous counties in central kentucky along the interstate corridor and the louisville metropolitan area  including southern indiana 
our markets range from the major metropolitan area of louisville in jefferson county  kentucky approximately miles north of our headquarters in elizabethtown  kentucky to hart county  kentucky  approximately miles south of elizabethtown to harrison county  indiana approximately miles northwest of our headquarters 
our core markets have experienced a growth rate of in deposits for the past three years 
based on the current economic slow down  management anticipates that our markets may not continue to grow at a similar rate experienced over the last few years 
however  we believe we will still be well positioned to benefit from growth in our local markets when the economy rebounds in the future 
during the second quarter of  we completed the acquisition of fsb bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  the farmers state bank 
the farmers state bank had approximately million in total assets and million in deposits with offices in harrison and floyd county  indiana 
these counties are adjacent to four of our kentucky counties and are part of the louisville msa 
the acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to our earnings during the first full year of the combined operations 
during the third quarter  we opened our twentieth full service banking center  which expanded our current footprint in bullitt county  kentucky 
the cedar grove banking center complements our existing branches located in shepherdsville and mt 
washington  kentucky 
we will continue our expansion efforts in with two additional banking centers under development 
one will be in hardin county  kentucky located at the entrance to the fort knox military base 
the other will be our fourth site in louisville  kentucky and located in the middletown area 
over the past several years we have focused on enhancing and expanding our retail and commercial banking network in our core markets as well as establishing our presence in the louisville market 
our core markets  where we have a combined market share  have become increasingly competitive as several new banks have entered those markets during the past few years 
in order to protect and grow our market share  we are replacing existing branches with newer  enhanced facilities and anticipate constructing several new facilities over the next few years 
in addition to the enhancement and expansion in our core markets  we have been increasing our presence in the louisville market 
our acquisition of fsb bancshares  inc has broadened our retail branch network in the louisville market  which now extends into southern indiana 
approximately of the deposit base in the louisville market is controlled by six out of state banks 
while the market is very competitive  we believe this creates an opportunity for smaller community banks with more power to make decisions locally 
we believe our investment in these initiatives along with our continued commitment to a high level of customer service will enhance our market share in our core markets and our development in the louisville market 
our retail branch network continues to generate encouraging results 
total deposits have grown over the past three years 
total deposits were million at december   an increase of million from december  the continued development of the retail branch network into the louisville market also yielded positive results 
we have a combined million in deposits in our three full service banking centers in the louisville market 
we opened two of these facilities in the 
table of contents second quarter of to support our growing customer base in this market 
in june we opened our third new full service banking center in louisville 
additional sites within the louisville market are under development with our fourth location scheduled to open in the second quarter of competition for deposits continues to be challenging in all of the markets we serve 
this intense competition and actions by the fomc could add to additional margin compression as the interest rate environment continues to be volatile 
we have developed a strong commercial real estate niche in our markets 
we have an experienced team of bankers who are focused on providing service and convenience to our customers 
it is quite common for our bankers to close loans at a customer s place of business or even the customer s personal residence 
this high level of service has been especially well received in our louisville market  which is dominated by regional banks 
currently  of our loan portfolio resides in the louisville market 
to further develop our commercial banking relationships in louisville  we opened a private banking office in april this office is an upscale facility complementing our full service centers in louisville allowing us to further attract commercial deposit relationships in conjunction with our commercial lending relationships 
this emphasis on commercial lending generated growth in the total loan portfolio and growth in commercial loans over the past three years 
commercial loans were million at december   an increase of million  or from december  although we had substantial growth in the loan portfolio during the year  credit quality remained challenging in there was a significant migration of loans into the special mention and substandard loan categories during the second half of the year resulting in higher provision for loan losses 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million compared to million at december  allowance for loan loss to total loans increased to at december  compared to at december  the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans fell to from at december  compared to december  despite the continued deterioration in economic conditions during the fourth quarter  the corporation s capital position remained well capitalized as defined by regulatory standards 
our capital position was further bolstered in the first quarter of by our participation in the us treasury department capital purchase program 
under the capital purchase program  we sold million of cumulative perpetual preferred shares to the us treasury in a transaction that closed on january  it is our belief that the economy is in a very deep and long lasting recession 
during the last quarter of  the continued economic slowdown moved to sectors not previously impacted including consumer  commercial  industrial among others 
credit issues are broadening in these sectors and economic recovery is most likely several quarters away 
we will continue to monitor credit quality very closely in as this recession persists 
as the economy and the financial sector continue to struggle  probable losses in the loan portfolio could increase  resulting in higher provision for loan losses during subsequent development on january   we sold million of cumulative perpetual preferred shares  with a liquidation preference of  per share the senior preferred shares to the us treasury under the terms of its capital purchase plan 
pursuant to cpp  the us treasury will purchase up to billion of senior preferred shares on standardized terms from qualifying financial institutions as part of the troubled asset relief program authorized by the emergency economic stabilization act of the senior preferred shares constitute tier capital and rank senior to our common shares 
the senior preferred shares pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and will reset to a rate of per annum after five years 

table of contents under the terms of the cpp stock purchase agreement  we also issued the us treasury a warrant to purchase an amount of our common stock equal to of the aggregate amount of the senior preferred shares  or million 
the warrant entitles the us treasury to purchase  common shares at a purchase price of per share 
the initial exercise price for the warrant and the number of shares subject to the warrant were determined by reference to the market price of our common stock calculated on a day trailing average as of december   the date the us treasury approved our application 
the warrant has a term of years 
the cpp is voluntary and requires a participating institution to comply with a number of restrictions and provisions  including standards for executive compensation and corporate governance and limitations on share repurchases and the declaration and payment of dividends on common shares 
the standard terms of the cpp provide that a participating financial institution may not without the consent of the us treasury pay regular quarterly dividends in an amount greater than the most recent quarterly dividend paid before october   which is per share in our case 
this dividend limitation will remain in effect for the earlier of three years or until such time that the preferred shares are redeemed 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses is critical to the understanding of our results of operations since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan loss review committee  which is comprised of senior officers  evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
we estimate the allowance using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses based in part on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio are more dependent upon credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was our estimate of probable losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate resulted in a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million for the period 
if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could be materially increased 
goodwill and other intangible assets costs in excess of the estimated fair value of identified assets acquired through purchase transactions are recorded as an asset 
as per statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  an annual impairment analysis 
table of contents is required to be performed to determine if the asset is impaired and needs to be written down to its fair value 
this assessment is conducted annually or more frequently if conditions warrant 
per the december  analysis  no impairment was identified as a result of these tests 
in making these impairment analyses  management must make subjective assumptions regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
it is possible that these judgments may change over time as market conditions or our strategies change  and these changes may cause us to record impairment changes to adjust the goodwill to its estimated fair value 
impairment of investment securities all unrealized losses are reviewed to determine whether the losses are other than temporary 
investment securities are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation to determine whether a decline in their value belowamortized cost is other than temporary 
we evaluate a number of factors including  but not limited to valuation estimates provided by investment brokers  how much fair value has declined below amortized cost  how long the decline in fair value has existed  the financial condition of the issuer  significant rating agency changes on the issuer  and management s intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the possibility for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized

net interest income the principal source of our revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as changes in market interest rates 
the growth in our commercial loan portfolio has increased net interest income 
the increase in the volume of interest earning assets increased net interest income by million for compared to a year ago 
average interest earning assets increased million for compared to 
table of contents despite the increase in interest earning assets  our net interest margin realized a modest decline of eleven basis points 
the yield on earning assets averaged for compared to an average yield on earning assets of for the same period in this decrease was offset by a decrease in our cost of funds 
net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets decreased to for compared to for the period 
our cost of funds averaged for the period compared to an average cost of funds of for the same period in going forward  our cost of funds is expected to continue to decrease as certificates of deposit re price and roll off into new certificates of deposit at lower interest rates 
our net interest margin is likely to compress in future quarters as a result of the federal open market committee fomc decreasing the federal funds rate by basis points since september the current federal funds rate is a range of to 
correspondingly  variable rate loans that are tied to the federal prime rate are immediately re priced downward with these rate cuts 
however  interest rates paid on customer deposits  which are priced off of the london interbank offering rate libor  have not adjusted downward proportionately with the declining interest yields on loans and investments 
libor  which is a market driven rate  did not decline in rate as much as the prime rate 
therefore  we do not expect our deposit costs to decline as fast as our yield on loans 
sixty percent of deposits are time deposits that re price over a longer period of time 
this difference in the timing of the repricing of our assets and deposits is expected to continue to lower our net interest margin

in addition  we continue to emphasize growing our checking account base to better enhance our profitability and franchise value 
we originate qualified va  khc  rhc and conventional secondary market loans and sell them into the secondary market with servicing rights released 
prevailing mortgage interest rates fell substantially in late and remained at attractive levels during helping to contribute to the increase in the volume of loans closed for we invest in various types of liquid assets  including united states treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  mutual funds  stocks and others

currently  one of the original nine lots held for sale remains unsold 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  during the second and fourth quarters of on equity securities 
management believes this impairment was primarily attributable to current economic conditions

these associates were hired for a commercial private banking center which opened in april  a new louisville retail branch facility that opened in june  a new bullitt county retail branch facility that opened in august and other positions to support our growth 
we added twenty additional associates in the second quarter of as a result of the recent acquisition 
we look for a continued increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in line with recent years  as we progress with our retail expansion and market protection efforts 
office occupancy expense and equipment and outside services and data processing increased due to additional operating expenses related to our expansion efforts and a system upgrade 
we anticipate the increased level of non interest expense to continue in with additional retail expansion

on october   the fdic published a restoration plan designed to replenish the deposit insurance fund over a period of five years and to increase the deposit insurance reserve ratio 
in order to implement the restoration plan  the fdic proposes to change both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates 
either an increase in the risk category of our bank subsidiary  or adjustments to the base assessment rates  could materially increase our deposit insurance premiums and assessments

the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses quarterly to maintain a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the committee determines the allowance by applying loss estimates to graded loans by categories  as described below

this relationship had been previously classified during the first quarter of we also recorded a million specific reserve on a commercial real estate relationship during the fourth quarter of the reserve was increased based on an updated appraisal of the underlying collateral 
the increase in the provision was also related to strong loan growth in the overall portfolio as well as from specific reserves on several other commercial real estate relationships

it is our expectation that the economy will remain in a recession at least for the next several quarters 
credit quality will continue to be one of our primary focuses in the million increase in substandard assets for was primarily the result of downgrading loans with twelve borrowers with balances ranging from  to million 
offsetting this increase was the transfer of three classified loans having balances of million  million and million to real estate acquired through foreclosure

although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
we develop our allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates represent a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio  which we apply to individual loans based on loan type 

table of contents non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans longer than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans under sfas  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired when we no longer anticipate full principal or interest payments in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from collateral 
we review our loans on a regular basis and implement normal collection procedures when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
we generally charge off consumer loans when management deems a loan uncollectible and any available collateral has been liquidated 
we handle commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies on an individual basis with the advice of legal counsel 
we recognize interest income on loans on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
we discontinue accruing interest on impaired loans when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when we discontinue interest accrual  we reverse existing accrued interest and subsequently recognize interest income only to the extent we receive cash payments 
we classify real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
we classify new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired we record it at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
we charge any write down of the property at the time of acquisition to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense 
real estate acquired through foreclosure increased million to million at december  the increase was primarily the result of three commercial credit relationships totaling million  million and million that were transferred during the period

these credit relationships are secured by real estate and we have provided adequate allowance based on current information 
all non performing loans are considered impaired 
non performing assets for the period include million in restructured commercial  mortgage and consumer loans 
restructured loans primarily consist of five credit relationships with balances ranging from  to  the terms of these loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest and extend the term  thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
the borrowers are currently meeting the terms of the restructured loans 
the decrease in restructured loans from december  was primarily due to the removal of one credit relationship totaling million from the restructured loan category since the terms of the loan are now substantially equivalent to terms on which loans with comparable risks are being made and the borrower has performed per the terms of the contract 
investment securities interest on securities provides us our largest source of interest income after interest on loans  constituting of the total interest income for the year ended december  the securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings and contributes to the management of interest rate risk 
we have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including short term united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks  bankers acceptances  and federal funds 
we may also invest a portion of our assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
we are also authorized to invest in mutual funds and stocks whose assets conform to the investments that we are authorized to make directly 
the available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios decreased by million during the period as securities were called for redemption in accordance with their terms due to decreasing rates 
the fsb bancshares  inc acquisition contributed approximately million in federal agencies and obligations of states and political subdivisions that are held to maturity 
we also purchased  in equity securities during the period 

table of contents we review all unrealized losses at least on a quarterly basis to determine whether the losses are other than temporary and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
we consider the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  we may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
the unrealized losses on our temporarily impaired debt securities held in state and municipal issuers are a result of changes in interest rates for fixed rate securities where the interest rate received is less than the current rate available for new offerings of similar securities 
because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity and not credit quality  and because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  we have evaluated the decline in the fair value of our trust preferred securities  which are included in corporate securities and are directly related to the credit and liquidity crisis being experienced in the financial services industry over the past year 
the trust preferred securities market is currently inactive making the valuation of trust preferred securities very difficult 
the trust preferred securities are valued by management using unobservable inputs ie  level inputs under sfas no 
through a discounted cash flow analysis as permitted under sfas and using the expected cash flows appropriately discounted using present value techniques 
refer to note fair value for more information 
all of our trust preferred securities remain investment grade with the exception of three securities and have continued to pay interest as scheduled through december   and are expected to continue paying interest as scheduled 
we believe the cash flows of our trust preferred securities  as discounted  appropriately reflect the estimated fair value of the securities 
management has analyzed this portfolio to determine whether the decline is other than temporary and has concluded that only temporary impairment exists 
see note securities for more information 
management will continue to evaluate these securities for impairment quarterly 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we have reflected the current period temporary fair value decline in stockholders equity through comprehensive income 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  during the year on equity securities with a cost basis of  management believes this impairment was primarily attributable to current economic conditions 
since recovery does not appear likely in the near future  we recognized the impairment losses 
previously  we recognized the decline in market value of these equity securities in stockholders equity through comprehensive income 
we continue to monitor these holdings

deposits we rely primarily on providing excellent customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by 
table of contents competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years market conditions have caused us to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of the use of those products on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
in conjunction with our initiatives to expand and enhance our retail branch network  we emphasize growing our customer checking account base to better enhance profitability and franchise value 
total deposits increased million compared to december  the acquisition of fsb bancshares  inc contributed approximately million in deposits 
retail and commercial deposits increased million which was offset by a million decrease in public funds and brokered certificates for the period 
brokered deposits were million at december  compared to million at december  to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from these changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins 
we continue to offer attractive certificate rates for various terms to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current rate environment  while protecting the margin 
we offer a broad selection of deposit instruments  including non interest bearing checking  statement and passbook savings accounts  health savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of our deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
management periodically adjusts interest rates paid on our deposit products  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties 
we also offer certificates of deposit with a variety of terms  interest rates and minimum deposit requirements 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively for funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  market conditions continue to significantly affect our ability to attract and maintain deposits and our cost of funds 
the following table breaks down our deposits

these borrowings averaged a rate of for and for advances from federal home loan bank deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for our general business purposes 
we can also use advances borrowings from the fhlb of cincinnati to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
advances from the fhlb are secured by our stock in the fhlb  certain securities  certain commercial real estate loans and substantially all of our first mortgage  multi family and open end home equity loans 
at december  we had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and the capacity to increase our borrowings an additional million 
the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages  other real estate loans and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided that we meet certain creditworthiness standards

the trust loaned the proceeds of the offering to us in exchange for junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures which we used to finance the purchase of fsb bancshares  inc in accordance with fasb interpretation  the trust is not consolidated with our financial statements but rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability 
the subordinated debentures  which mature on june   can be called at par in whole or in part on or after june  the subordinated debentures pay a fixed rate of for thirty years 
we have the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debt from time to time for a period not to exceed five consecutive years 
the subordinated debentures are considered as tier i capital for the corporation under current regulatory guidelines 
in  another trust we formed completed a private placement of  shares of cumulative trust preferred securities with a liquidation preference of  per security for a total outstanding of million 
these securities pay distributions of interest 
on march  we called the million in subordinated debentures adjustable quarterly at libor plus basis points on march  and issued new year cumulative trust preferred securities at a year fixed rate of adjusting quarterly thereafter at libor plus basis points

liquidity liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  at a reasonable cost  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
we maintain an investment and funds management policy  which identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the asset liability committee continually monitors our liquidity position 
our sources of funds include the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  the payment of principal on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds realized from loans held for sale  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding 
we also secured federal funds borrowing lines from three of our correspondent banks 
two of the lines are for million each and the other one is for million 
our banking centers also provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to our competitors or other markets in response to interest rate changes  we have the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
traditionally  we have also borrowed from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we had sufficient collateral available to borrow  approximately  an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future

table of contents sources of funding for the corporation include dividends from the bank  borrowings and access to the capital markets 
also  the corporation has lines of credit of million with a correspondent bank 
the primary source of funding for the corporation has been dividends and returns of investment from the bank 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the corporation by the bank without prior approval of the kofi 
under these laws  the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
as a result of a million dividend in used to finance the purchase of fsb bancshares  inc  the bank needed and obtained approval for its first quarter dividend 
because of these limitations  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the corporation 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million to the corporation 
capital stockholders equity decreased  during  primarily due to cash dividends declared and the net change in unrealized losses on securities available for sale 
this decrease was offset by net income earned during the year

the current repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of  shares from time to time if market conditions are deemed favorable 
the repurchase program will remain effective until the number of shares authorized is repurchased or until the program expires november  as of december    shares could be repurchased under the current stock repurchase program 
on january   we sold million of cumulative perpetual preferred shares  with a liquidation preference of  per share the senior preferred shares to the us treasury under the terms of its capital purchase plan 
pursuant to cpp  the us treasury will purchase up to billion of senior preferred shares on standardized terms from qualifying financial institutions as part of the troubled asset relief program authorized by the emergency economic stabilization act of the senior preferred shares constitute tier capital and rank senior to our common shares 
the senior preferred shares pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and will reset to a rate of per annum after five years 
the senior preferred shares may be redeemed at any time  at our option 
under the terms of the cpp stock purchase agreement  we also issued the us treasury a warrant to purchase an amount of our common stock equal to of the aggregate amount of the senior preferred shares  or million 
the warrant entitles the us treasury to purchase  common shares at a purchase price of per share 
the initial exercise price for the warrant and the number of shares subject to the warrant were determined by reference to the market price of our common stock calculated on a day trailing average as of december   the date the us treasury approved our application 
the warrant has a term of years and is potentially dilutive to earnings per share 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banks

impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation and changes in prices 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
we also incorporate assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december  and december  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  their relative pricing schedules  market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
we use various asset liability strategies to manage the re pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within our guidelines 
table of contents of acceptable levels of risk taking 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables  our balance sheet has an asset sensitive position 
this means that our earning assets  which consist of loans and investment securities  will change in price at a faster rate than our deposits and borrowings 
therefore  if short term interest rates increase  our net interest income will increase 
likewise  if short term interest rates decrease  our net interest income will decrease 
our sensitivity to interest rate changes is presented based on data as of december  and december  decrease in rates increase in rates dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points projected interest income loans investments total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base december  decrease in rates increase in rates dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points projected interest income loans investments total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base
