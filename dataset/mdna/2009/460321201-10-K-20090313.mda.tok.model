critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments or estimates and entail material uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to our rail ferry service segment voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
our voyage expenses are estimated at the beginning of the voyages based on historical actual costs or from industry sources familiar with those types of charges 
as the voyage progresses  these estimated costs are revised with actual charges and timely adjustments are made 
the expenses are ratably expensed over the voyage based on the number of days in progress at the end of the period 
we believe there is no material difference between recording estimated expenses ratably over the voyage versus recording expenses as incurred 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require no estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets 
various methods are used to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our depreciable assets and due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
because drydocking charges can be material in any one period  we believe that the acceptable deferred method provides a better matching for the amortization of those costs over future revenue periods benefiting from the drydocking of our vessel 
we capitalize only those costs that are incurred to meet regulatory requirements or upgrades  or that add economic life to the vessel 
normal repairs  whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not  are expensed as incurred 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
however  pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain of our foreign operations are subject to us income taxes when those earnings are repatriated to the us we have indefinitely re invested earnings of  and  of and foreign earnings  respectively  and accordingly  have not provided deferred taxes in the amount of  and  against those earnings 
the jobs creation act  which first applied to us on january   changed the united states tax treatment of the foreign operations of our us flag vessels and our international flag shipping operations 
we made an election under the jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under a tonnage tax rather than under the usual us corporate income tax regime 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we adopted fin on january  self retention insurance as explained further in note e to the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report  we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish self insurance provisions for hull and machinery and loss of hire for each policy year based on our estimates of eventual claims settlement cost 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estimated potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  historical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we believe that insurance and the indemnification of a previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries may mitigate our exposure 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant s employment history with the company 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
in september of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
this statement requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under sfas no 
 actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the measurement date  the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured  is required to be the company s fiscal year end

the increase in revenue from million in to million in was due to increased voyages and freight rate escalation for increasing fuel costs in rail ferry service gross voyage results for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a profit of million in this increase was due to additional sailings in as well as increased cargo volumes which were carried as a result of the addition of second decks on each rail ferry vessel 
operation of the vessels with the second decks began in the third quarter of revenues for this segment increased from million in to million in due to the additional sailings and increased cargo volumes utilizing second deck capacity 
other gross voyage profit for this segment increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to adjusted earnings recorded in for dry bulk s subsidiary companies which is discussed further below 
other income and expenses administrative and general expenses a g increased from million in to million in a substantial portion of this increase was due to fees related to non ordinary charges associated with advisory and legal costs resulting from an unaffiliated shipping company s unsolicited conditional offer to purchase the company s outstanding shares  employee relocation expenses associated with the move of the company s headquarters to mobile  alabama  and amortization of stock grants awarded to executive officers

these increases were primarily wages and maintenance  including drydock amortization charges on our us flag pure car truck carriers 
revenues for the segment increased from million in to million in this improvement is a result of higher volumes of supplemental cargoes in on our us flag pure car truck carriers  higher charter rates in on our international flag pure car truck carriers and increased charterhire days for our us flag jones act coal carrier  which was in drydock during the first and second quarters of contract of affreightment gross voyage profit of million for this segment in was consistent with while this segment operated more voyages in  higher port and fuel costs eroded some of these positive results as compared to rail ferry service gross voyage results before impairment loss for this segment improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this improvement is primarily from higher cargo volumes due to the installation of the second decks  which began operating in the third quarter of revenues for this segment increased from million in to million in due to the completion and operation of the second deck cargo volume in second half of the added volume caused operating margins to improve  primarily in the fourth quarter of the pre tax impairment loss of million recorded in the second quarter of was related to our investment in the rail ferry service s terminal in new orleans located on the mississippi river gulf outlet mr go

other gross voyage profit for this segment increased from  in to million in primarily due to nonrecurring expenses in of million related to terminating the lease of an intermodal terminal facility in memphis  tennessee 
the decrease in revenue for this segment was mainly due to prior year income adjustments 
other income and expenses administrative and general expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily associated with one time costs related to the termination of our lease agreement on our former new orleans office and an increase in audit fees related to the initial audit of our internal control over financial reporting as required under section of the sarbanes oxley act

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital which we define as the difference between our total current assets and total current liabilities increased from million at december   to million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased during by million to a total of million 
this increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million  and cash provided by investing activities of million  offset by cash used by financing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt 
operating activities generated positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation  amortization and gains on sales of assets and investments 
cash provided by operating activities of million for also included  among other things  the add back of the non cash loss of million on the early redemption of preferred stock  the deduction of the non cash million pre tax gain on the sale of lash assets  and the deduction of the non cash recognition of million in earnings from our equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  which included a gain on the sale of a panamax bulk carrier 
we received cash dividends of million from the normal operations of our unconsolidated entities  with the proceeds from the aforementioned sale presented in investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities of million for included proceeds from the sale of our discontinued lash liner service assets of million  proceeds from dry bulk s subsidiary company s sale of the panamax bulk carrier of million  proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million and principal payments received under direct financing leases of million  partially offset by capital improvements of million  including improvements to our information technology systems and additional tank work on our rail ferry vessels 
cash used for financing activities of million for included regularly scheduled debt payments of million  payment of million on the early redemption of our preferred stock  million of repurchases of our common stock  and million on cash dividends paid on our common stock 
in march of  we signed an agreement with regions bank to provide us with an unsecured revolving line of credit for million 
this facility replaced the prior secured revolving line of credit for the like amount 
as of december   million of the million revolving credit facility  which expires in april of  was pledged as collateral for letters of credit  and the remaining million was available 
currently we are evaluating our options to increase our line of credit and expect tighter bank restrictions due to the overall condition of the credit markets 
we frequently evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional vessels or businesses 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions 
we generally do not announce our acquisitions or dispositions until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement 
we may require additional financing in connection with any such acquisitions  the consummation of which could have a material impact on our financial condition or operations 
preferred stock redemption on february   we redeemed our  outstanding shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
in lieu of the cash redemption  holders of  shares of the preferred stock elected to convert their shares into approximately  shares of the company s common stock 
the remaining  outstanding shares of preferred stock were retired for cash including accrued and unpaid dividends to  but excluding  the redemption date  pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock 
upon completion of the redemption  we no longer have any shares of our convertible exchangeable preferred stock outstanding 
the total cash payment for the redemption of the preferred stock including the accrued and unpaid dividends was  we had a charge to earnings of approximately million in the first quarter of from the redemption of the preferred stock 
stock repurchase program on january   the company s board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to a total of  shares of the company s common stock 
we expect that any share repurchases under this plan will generally be made from time to time for cash in open market transactions at prevailing market prices 
the timing and amount of any purchases under the program will be determined by management based upon market conditions and other factors 
through december   we have repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
unless and until the board otherwise provides  this new authorization will remain open indefinitely or until we reach the  share limit 
debt and lease obligations as of december   we held three vessels under operating contracts  six vessels under bareboat charter or lease agreements and four vessels under time charter agreements 
the types of vessels held under these agreements include four pure car truck carriers  five breakbulk multi purpose vessels  two container vessels  and a tanker vessel operating in our time charter segment and a molten sulphur carrier operating in our contracts of affreightment segment 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities 
we entered into a new lease agreement on our new york city office which became effective october  the length of the lease is nine years and nine months  with graduated payments starting after an initial nine month period of free rent 
the agreement calls for total annual payments of  for years one through five and total annual payments of  for years six through nine 
the rent expense  along with the associated leasehold improvements are being amortized using the straight line method over the lease term 
debt covenants in the unanticipated event that our cash flow and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  obtain additional equity capital  enter into financings of our unencumbered vessels or restructure debt 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity despite the current disruption of the capital and credit markets and can continue to fund working capital and capital investment liquidity needs through cash flow from operations 
while not significant to date  the disruption in capital and credit markets may result in increased borrowing costs associated with any additional short term and long term debt 
we presently have variable to fixed interest rate swaps on of our long term debt 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following is a summary of the scheduled maturities by period of our debt and lease obligations that were outstanding as of december  debt and lease obligations s total thereafter long term debt including current maturities interest payments operating leases vessel commitments total by period the above contractual obligations table does not include our approximate million obligation to the alabama state port authority related to the terminal upgrades in mobile  al  to be paid by us over the ten year terminal lease 
this long term obligation  reported in other long term liabilities  will be met by the operation of our rail ferry vessels in the mobile port 
the chart further excludes contingent equity contributions that may be payable to dry bulk under the circumstances described under liquidity and capital resources bulk carriers 
for additional information on our operating leases  see note j 
current economic and market issues the current economic crisis has affected us in a number of areas 
due to the turmoil in the financial markets  banking institutions have tightened lending standards or eliminated access to credit for new projects 
financial institutions with which we have no existing relationship have indicated an unwillingness to lend to us 
those institutions with which we do have existing relationships ceased lending activities in late  but have recently indicated a willingness to extend credit under appropriate circumstances 
large increases in debt financing costs have hampered the ability of transportation companies  including us  to undertake new projects requiring borrowed funds 
we have maintained for a number of years banking relationships with financially solid institutions 
based on information currently available to us  we believe these institutions remain stable 
while the exact effects of the crisis to our customers is not known  we have not suffered from the nonpayment of freights or charterhires being earned in the ordinary course of business 
we continue to review the status of our customers and are ready to take appropriate actions to reduce potential exposures should the occasion arise 
while we have been fortunate in our ability to avoid potential hardships from the nonpayment of freights  we cannot provide you with assurance that this will continue 
for more information  see item a  risk factors 
due to the dramatic fall in the financial markets  our pension plan suffered negative returns for the year ended during  we maintained an asset allocation within the plan of up to a maximum exposure of equities and fixed income instruments 
results derived from the marketplace negatively impacted the plan s funding status 
as of december  we show an underfunded status in other comprehensive income  however  we have met our required funding obligation under the current pension protection act 
we expect to contribute million for fiscal year for more information  see note f  employee benefit plans 
restructuring of liner services and disposition of certain lash assets the board of directors decided in the fourth quarter of to dispose of certain lash liner service assets 
the decision was based on the belief that we could generate substantial cash flow and profit on the disposition of the assets  while improving our future operating results 
accordingly  we sold our lash feeder vessel and barges in the first quarter of in the second quarter of we sold our one remaining us flag lash vessel and lash barges 
in the third quarter of  the company elected to discontinue its international lash service by the end of during the first quarter of  we sold the one remaining lash vessel and the remainder of our lash barges 
the pre tax gain of million recorded in reflects a gain of million on the sale of the lash feeder vessel and liner vessel  and million on the sale of lash barges 
the gain of million recorded in reflects the gain from the sale of one lash vessel and remaining lash barges 
during  we generated no revenues from our lash services  compared to million for profit from operations before taxes were  in  compared to a million loss in our us flag lash service and international lash service were reported in continuing operations as a part of our liner segment in periods prior to june  financial information for all periods presented have been restated to remove the effects of those operations from continuing operations 
rail ferry service expansion this service provides a unique combination of rail and water ferry service between the us gulf coast and mexico 
the relatively low operating profit margin generated by this service makes higher cargo volumes necessary to achieve meaningful levels of cash flow and profitability 
the capacity of the vessels operating in our rail ferry service defines the maximum revenues and  in turn  the cash flow and gross profits that can be generated by the service 
accordingly we have made investments that essentially double the capacity of the service including the construction of second decks on each of the ships as well as construction of new terminals in mobile  alabama and an upgraded terminal in coatzacoalcos  mexico 
these capital investments have permitted us to expand our cargo volumes  reduce our cost per unit of cargo carried and increase our cash flow 
we completed construction of the second decks in mid at a total cost of approximately million  which we paid in full through december  the utilization of the second deck capacity is directly related to the terminal upgrades in mobile  al and coatzacoalcos  mexico 
both terminal upgrades were substantially completed in july and became operational at that time 
the total cost of the mobile terminal was approximately million  of which million was funded by a grant from the state of alabama 
the remaining million was financed by the alabama state docks and will be repaid over the ten year terminal lease

liquidity the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements

cash and cash equivalents increased during by million to a total of million 
this increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million and by investing activities of million  partially offset by cash used for financing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt  including million for the senior notes 
operating activities generated positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation  amortization  impairment loss and gains on sales of assets and investments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts  and in the past we have also utilized commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated its carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december  is not applicable due to the retirement of all of the company s remaining outstanding obligations of its senior unsecured notes in october of we have entered into ten interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  two in september of  one in november of  two in september of  one in november of  one in january  one in february and two in december in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
for each of these agreements  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is a liability of million  with the offsetting charge of million net of taxes in other comprehensive income 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in a million liability 
commodity price risk as of december   we do not have commodity swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to price risk related to the purchase of the estimated fuel requirements for our rail ferry service segment 
we have fuel surcharges in place for our rail ferry service  which we expect to effectively manage the price risk for those services during revenues from fuel surcharges in for the rail ferry service was million 
if we had commodity swap agreements  they could be structured to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices 
however  they would also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity 
a increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately  in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding decrease of approximately in our basic earnings per share based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  the additional fuel costs assumes no additional revenue was generated from fuel surcharges  however  we believe that some or all of the price increase could have been passed on to our customers through the aforementioned fuel surcharges during the same period but might have been limited by our need to maintain competitive rates 
our charterers in the time charter segment are responsible for purchasing vessel fuel requirements  thus  we have no fuel price risk in this segment 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase commitments during these contracts mature on various dates during the fair value of these contracts at december   is a liability of million 
the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates would be a liability of million for further information on our foreign currency contracts  see note o fair value of financial instruments on page f
