general our principal business is managing investment funds and providing investment management and counseling services to high net worth individuals and institutions 
our core strategy is to develop and sustain management expertise across a range of investment disciplines and to offer leading investment products and services through multiple distribution channels 
in executing this strategy  we have developed a broadly diversified product line and a powerful marketing  distribution and customer service capability 
although we manage and distribute a wide range of products and services  we operate in one business segment  namely as an investment adviser to funds and separate accounts 
we are a market leader in a number of investment areas  including tax managed equity  value equity  equity income  emerging market equity  floating rate bank loan  municipal bond  investment grade  global and high yield bond investing 
our diversified product line offers fund shareholders  retail managed account investors  institutional investors and high net worth clients a wide range of products and services designed and managed to generate attractive risk adjusted returns over the long term 
our equity products encompass a diversity of investment objectives  risk profiles  income levels and geographic representation 
our income investment products cover a broad duration and credit quality range and encompass both taxable and tax free investments 
as of october   we had billion in assets under management 
our principal retail marketing strategy is to distribute funds and separately managed accounts through financial intermediaries in the advice channel 
we have a broad reach in this marketplace  with distribution partners including national and regional broker dealers  independent broker dealers  independent financial advisory firms  banks and insurance companies 
we support these distribution partners with a team of more than sales professionals covering us and international markets 
specialized sales and marketing professionals in our wealth management solutions group serve as a resource to financial advisors seeking to help high net worth clients address wealth management issues and support the marketing of our products and services tailored to this marketplace 
we also commit significant resources to serving institutional and high net worth clients who access investment management services on a direct basis 
through our wholly owned affiliates and consolidated subsidiaries we manage investments for a broad range of clients in the institutional and high net worth marketplace  including corporations  endowments  foundations  family offices and public and private employee retirement plans 
specialized sales teams at our affiliates develop relationships in this market and deal directly with these clients 
our revenue is derived primarily from investment advisory  administration  distribution and service fees received from eaton vance funds and investment advisory fees received from separate accounts 
our fees are based primarily on the value of the investment portfolios we manage and fluctuate with changes in the total value and mix of assets under management 
such fees are recognized over the period that we manage these assets 
our major expenses are employee compensation  distribution related expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  facilities expense and information technology expense 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred sales commissions  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  investments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
market developments global equity and fixed income markets experienced significant volatility in the twelve months coinciding with our fiscal the s p index declined percent from october  to the march market bottom  reaching year lows 
equity markets then rallied nearly percent off the bottom through october   putting the s p at the end of our fiscal year percent above its level at the start of our fiscal year 
even with the recent market rally  business conditions remain challenging 
although ending assets under management increased percent year over year  reflecting strong net inflows and the impact of recovering equity markets in the second half of our fiscal year  average assets under management were percent lower  resulting in a significant decline in fiscal revenue relative to fiscal although we took steps to reduce costs in response to prevailing market conditions  our fiscal profit margins and net income were also adversely affected 
adverse market conditions affect our asset levels  operating results and the recoverability of our investments 
asset levels in fiscal  we experienced a decline in revenue relative to fiscal  primarily reflecting declines in average managed assets due to falling market values in the first half of the fiscal year 
average assets under management were billion in fiscal compared to billion in fiscal the first quarter acquisition of the tax advantaged bond strategies tabs business of md sass investors services md sass  which has a lower effective management fee rate than our overall business  contributed to a decline in our average effective fee rate to basis points in fiscal from basis points fiscal  as did significant growth in our separate account business  which earns lower fees on average than funds 
as a matter of course  investors in our sponsored open end funds and separate accounts have the ability to redeem their shares or investments at any time  without prior notice  and there are no material restrictions that would prevent investors from doing so 
operating results in fiscal our revenue fell by million  or percent  from fiscal our operating expenses declined by million  or percent  in the same period 
in falling markets  we benefit by having certain expenses tied to asset levels that decline as assets under management decline  such as certain distribution and service fees 
we also have expenses that adjust to decreases in operating earnings  such as the performance based management incentives we accrue 
our sales related expenses  including sales incentives  vary with the level of sales and the rate we pay to acquire those assets 
the variability of these expenses helps to partially offset lower revenue from declining markets 
beyond these substantially self compensating expense adjustments  we also reduced certain discretionary expenses 
recoverability of our investments we test our investments  including our investments in collateralized debt obligation cdo entities and investments classified as available for sale  for impairment on a quarterly basis 
our investments in cdo entities  which have been the subject of past impairments  have been reduced to million at october   reflecting impairment losses of million recognized in fiscal unrealized gains on investments classified as available for sale  net of tax  totaled million on october  compared to unrealized losses of million on october  we evaluate our investments in cdo entities and investments classified as available for sale for impairment using quantitative factors  including how long the investment has been in a net unrealized loss position  and qualitative factors  including the underlying credit quality of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment 
if markets deteriorate during the quarters ahead  our assessment of impairment on a quantitative basis may lead us to impair investments in cdo entities or investments classified as available for sale in future quarters that were in an unrealized loss position at october  we test our investments in affiliates and goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or as facts and circumstances indicate that additional analysis is warranted 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  we periodically review our deferred sales commissions and identifiable intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  assets under management assets under management of billion on october  were percent higher than the billion reported a year earlier  reflecting improving securities prices and strong open end fund  high net worth and institutional and retail managed account gross and net inflows and the million initial public offering of eaton vance national municipal opportunities trust in may

in thousands  except per share data net income earnings per share basic diluted operating margin nm nm we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the decrease in net income of million  or per diluted share  can be primarily attributed to the following a decrease in revenue of million  or percent  primarily due to the percent decrease in average assets under management and a decrease in our annualized effective fee rate to basis points in fiscal from basis points in fiscal the decrease in our annualized effective fee rate can be attributed to the increase in average separate account assets under management as a percentage of total average assets under management primarily as a result of the tabs acquisition in december a decrease in expenses of million  or percent  due to decreases in compensation expense  distribution expense  service fee expense  fund expenses and the amortization of deferred sales commissions  primarily reflecting decreases in both average assets under management and revenue

a decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million shares  or percent  primarily reflecting a decrease in the number of in the money share options included in the calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding and modest stock buybacks over the last twelve months 
we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the increase in net income of million  or per diluted share  can be primarily attributed to the following an increase in revenue of million  or percent  primarily due to increases in investment advisory  administration and service fees attributed to the percent increase in average assets under management 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in distribution and underwriter fees due to a decrease in average assets under management subject to these fees and a decrease in other revenue due to net realized and unrealized losses recognized on investments in consolidated funds 
net realized and unrealized losses on investments held in the portfolios of consolidated funds totaled million in fiscal  compared to net realized and unrealized gains of million in fiscal a decrease in expenses of million  or percent  due to decreases in compensation expense  distribution expense and the amortization of deferred sales commissions 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in service fee expense  fund expenses and other expenses 
the million decrease in distribution expense can be primarily attributed to the fiscal payment of one time structuring fees related to closed end funds and fiscal payments made to terminate dealer compensation agreements related to certain previously offered closed end funds  which together totaled million 
an increase in interest expense of million due to our million senior note offering on october  an increase in net realized and unrealized losses of million associated with seed investments in separately managed accounts 
an increase in impairment losses on investments in cdo entities of million 
an increase in income taxes of million  or percent  reflecting the increase in taxable income 
a decrease in weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million shares  or percent  reflecting share repurchases funded primarily by our million senior note offering on october  in evaluating operating performance we consider operating income and net income  which are calculated on a basis consistent with gaap  as well as adjusted operating income  an internally derived non gaap performance measure 
we define adjusted operating income as operating income excluding the results of consolidated funds and adding back stock based compensation  any write off of intangible assets or goodwill associated with our acquisitions and other items we consider non operating in nature 
we believe that adjusted operating income is a key indicator of our ongoing profitability and therefore use this measure as the basis for calculating performance based management incentives 
adjusted operating income is not  and should not be construed to be  a substitute for operating income computed in accordance with gaap 
however  in assessing the performance of the business  our management and our board of directors look at adjusted operating income as a measure of underlying performance  since operating results of consolidated funds and amounts resulting from one time events do not necessarily represent normal results of operations 
in addition  when assessing performance  management and the board look at performance both with and without stock based compensation  a non cash operating expense

the increase in consulting costs can be attributed primarily to increases in legal costs associated with new product development and other general consulting costs in fiscal the increase in communications expense can be attributed to higher telephone and printing costs 
the increase in other expenses can be attributed to increases in charitable giving  professional development  the amortization of intangible assets in conjunction with the purchase of additional non controlling interests in our majority owned subsidiaries and other corporate taxes

in thousands interest income interest expense nm realized losses on investments unrealized gains losses on investments nm nm foreign currency gains losses nm impairment losses on investments nm total other income expense nm interest income decreased by percent  or million  in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in effective interest rates 
interest income increased by percent  or million  in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in average cash balances in fiscal interest expense was flat year over year in fiscal  reflecting interest accrued on our senior notes 
interest expense increased by million in fiscal  reflecting the offering of our senior notes in october we recognized realized losses on investments totaling million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing losses incurred on investments in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
unrealized gains on investments of million and unrealized losses of million in fiscal and  respectively  also relate to investments in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
we recognized impairment losses totaling million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing losses related to a synthetic cdo entity and two of our cash flow instrument cdo entities 
the impairment loss associated with the synthetic cdo entity  which reduced our investment in that entity to zero in fiscal  resulted from a decrease in the estimated cash flows from the entity due to higher realized default rates and lower recovery rates on the reference securities underlying the synthetic cdo entity s portfolio of credit default swaps 
the impairment losses associated with the cash instrument cdo entities in both fiscal and resulted from decreases in the estimated future cash flows from the cdo entities due to increases in the default rates of the underlying loan portfolios 
income taxes our effective tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes  non controlling interest and equity in net income loss of affiliates was percent  percent and percent in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in our overall effective tax rate in fiscal can be attributed to a decrease in our effective state tax rate associated with the execution of a state tax voluntary disclosure agreement in fiscal that resulted in a net reduction in our income tax expense of million and a deferred tax adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to stock based compensation expense that resulted in a reduction in our income tax expense of million 
our policy for accounting for income taxes includes monitoring our business activities and tax policies to ensure that we are in compliance with federal  state and foreign tax laws 
in the ordinary course of business  various taxing authorities may not agree with certain tax positions we have taken  or applicable law may not be clear 
we periodically review these tax positions and provide for and adjust as necessary estimated liabilities relating to such positions as part of our overall tax provision 
non controlling interest non controlling interest decreased by million in fiscal  primarily due to a million adjustment in fiscal to reverse stock based compensation previously allocated to non controlling interest holders of our majority owned subsidiaries partially offset by an increase in the profitability of our majority owned subsidiaries and consolidated funds 
in fiscal  we determined that the allocation of stock based compensation expense to non controlling interest holders reduces our liability to non controlling interest holders in a manner that is not consistent with the agreements governing partnership distributions to those individuals 
the million adjustment represented the reversal of accumulated stock based compensation expense allocated to non controlling interest holders from the date of acquisition 
stock based compensation expense allocated to non controlling interest holders in prior periods was neither quantitatively nor qualitatively material to our consolidated financial statements in any of our previously reported fiscal years or periods 
non controlling interest increased by million in fiscal  primarily due to the million adjustment described above partially offset by a decrease in the non controlling interests held by minority shareholders of atlanta capital and parametric portfolio associates 
non controlling interest is not adjusted for taxes due to the underlying tax status of our consolidated subsidiaries 
atlanta capital  fox asset management  parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisors are limited liability companies that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes 
funds we consolidate are registered investment companies or private funds that are treated as pass through entities for tax purposes

cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term  highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash 
short term investments consist of an investment in a sponsored short term income fund 
investment advisory fees and other receivables primarily represent receivables due from sponsored funds and separately managed accounts for investment advisory and distribution services provided 
liquid assets represented percent  percent and percent of total assets on october   and  respectively 
the million decrease in liquid assets in fiscal can be attributed to a decrease in cash and short term investment balances of million and a decrease in investment advisory fees and other receivables of million 
the decrease in cash and short term investment balances in fiscal primarily reflects the million initial cost of the acquisition of tabs  the payment of million to purchase additional interests in parametric portfolio associates and atlanta capital management  the payment of million of dividends to shareholders and additions to equipment and leasehold improvements of million  offset by net cash provided by operating activities of million 
the decrease in investment advisory fees and other receivables can be attributed to the decrease in our revenue run rate at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal the million decrease in liquid assets in fiscal can be attributed to a decrease in cash and short term investment balances of million and a decrease in investment advisory fees and other receivables of million 
the decrease in cash and short term investment balances in fiscal primarily reflects the repurchase of million of non voting common stock following our million senior note offering in october  million of dividends to shareholders  the payment of million to purchase additional interests in parametric portfolio associates and atlanta capital management and additions to equipment and leasehold improvements of million offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of non voting common stock and net cash provided by operating activities of million 
on october   our debt included million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year notes due we also maintain a million revolving credit facility with several banks  which expires on august  the facility provides that we may borrow at libor based rates of interest that vary depending on the level of usage of the facility and our credit ratings 
the agreement contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage and requires us to pay an annual commitment fee on any unused portion 
on october   we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we continue to monitor our liquidity daily 
we experienced a significant reduction in operating revenue and operating income in fiscal  primarily reflecting lower average assets under management resulting from decreased market values of managed assets 
we remain committed to growing our business and expect that our main uses of cash will be to invest in new products  acquire shares of our non voting common stock  pay dividends  make strategic acquisitions  enhance technology infrastructure and pay the operating expenses of the business  which are largely variable in nature and fluctuate with revenue and assets under management 
we believe that our existing liquid assets  cash flows from operations  which contributed million in fiscal  and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility  are sufficient to meet our current and forecasted operating cash needs and to satisfy our future commitments as more fully described in contractual obligations below 
the risk exists  however  that if we determine we need to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt in the future  resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
our ability to enter the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including the state of global credit and equity markets  interest rates  credit spreads and our credit ratings 
if we are unable to access capital markets to issue new debt  refinance existing debt or sell shares of our non voting common stock as needed  or if we are unable to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  our business could be adversely impacted 
we do not anticipate raising new capital in the near future 
income taxes long term deferred income taxes  which in previous periods related principally to the deferred income tax liability associated with deferred sales commissions offset by the deferred income tax benefit associated with stock based compensation  changed from a net long term deferred tax liability to a net long term deferred tax benefit in fiscal as a result of a change in tax accounting method for certain closed end fund expenses 
we filed the change in tax accounting method with the internal revenue service in fiscal for expenses associated with the launch of closed end funds  which were historically deducted for tax purposes as incurred and are now capitalized and amortized over a year period 
upon filing the change in tax accounting method  we recorded a deferred tax asset of million  the majority of which will amortize over a year period  and a corresponding deferred tax liability of million  which will reverse over a four year period ending october  the net current deferred tax liability of million as of october  principally represents the current portion of the remaining million deferred tax liability associated with the change in accounting method 
taxes payable at october  included a prepaid balance of million and a long term payable of million  which are included in other current assets and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  respectively 
taxes payable of million at october  were classified as current 
the net change in total taxes payable in fiscal reflects a current tax provision totaling million offset by million of income taxes paid  the recognition of million of excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises in fiscal and the execution of a state tax voluntary disclosure agreement in fiscal that resulted in a million net reduction in our income tax expense 
contractual obligations the following table details our future contractual obligations as of october  payments due in millions total less than year years years after years operating leases facilities and equipment senior notes interest payment on senior notes investment in private equity partnership unrecognized tax benefits total this amount includes unrecognized tax benefits along with accrued interest and penalties 
in september  we signed a long term lease to move our corporate headquarters to a new location in boston 
the lease commenced in may the build out of our new corporate headquarters is now complete 
in july  we committed to invest up to million in a private equity partnership that invests in companies in the financial services industry 
as of october   we had invested million of the maximum million of committed capital 
interests held by non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital  fox asset management  parametric portfolio associates and parametric risk advisers are not subject to mandatory redemption 
the purchase of non controlling interests is predicated  for each subsidiary  on the exercise of a series of puts held by non controlling unit holders and calls held by us 
neither the exercise of the puts nor the exercise of the calls is contingent upon the non controlling holders of the acquired entities remaining employed by the company 
the puts provide the non controlling shareholders the right to require us to purchase these retained interests at specific intervals over time  while the calls provide us with the right to require the non controlling shareholders to sell their retained equity interests to us at specified intervals over time  as well as upon the occurrence of certain events such as death or permanent disability 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the timing of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
the value assigned to the purchase of an originating non controlling interest is based  in each case  on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes of the subsidiary  which is a measure that is intended to represent fair market value 
there is no discrete floor or ceiling on any non controlling interest purchase 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate that the purchase of non controlling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries may be a significant use of cash in future years 
accordingly  future payments to be made to purchase non controlling interests have been excluded from the above table  unless a put or call option has been exercised and a mandatory firm commitment exists for us to purchase such non controlling interests 
in april  the non controlling interest holders of parametric portfolio associates exercised a put option  requiring us to purchase an additional interest in parametric portfolio associates for million 
the transaction settled on may  and increased our capital ownership interest from percent to percent and our profits interest from percent to percent 
the additional purchase price was allocated among intangible assets  goodwill and non controlling interest 
pursuant to the terms of a unit purchase and redemption agreement dated november   we purchased an additional interest in atlanta capital for million on june  the transaction increased our ownership interest from percent to percent at closing 
the additional purchase price was allocated among intangible assets  goodwill and non controlling interest 
contemporaneously  the company purchased a non controlling capital interest in atlanta capital management holdings  llc acm holdings  a partnership that owns the non controlling interests of atlanta capital  for million 
the company s interest in acm holdings is non voting and entitles the company to receive million when the put or call options for the non controlling interests of atlanta capital are exercised 
our investment in acm holdings is included as a component of long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet at october  in may  we executed a call option  requiring the non controlling interest holders of fox asset management to sell to us an additional interest in fox asset management 
the transaction settled on june  and increased our ownership interest from percent to percent 
pursuant to the terms of the unit purchase agreement  there was no transfer of proceeds at closing 
on december   the company acquired the tabs business of md sass  a privately held investment manager based in new york  new york 
the tabs business managed billion in client assets on december   consisting of billion in institutional and high net worth family office accounts and billion in retail managed accounts 
subsequent to closing  the tabs business was reorganized as the tax advantaged bond strategies division of evm 
tabs maintains its former leadership  portfolio team and investment strategies 
its tax advantaged income products and services continue to be offered directly to institutional and family office clients  and are being offered by evd to retail investors through financial intermediaries 
the company paid million in cash to acquire the tabs business  including costs associated with the acquisition 
all future payments will be paid in cash 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company recorded million of intangible assets and a contingent purchase price liability of million 
the company will be obligated to make seven annual contingent payments based on prescribed multiples of tabs s revenue for the twelve months ending december       and the amount of each contingent payment is based upon a prescribed multiple of revenue 
there is no defined floor or ceiling on any payment 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount of any payment in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made have been excluded from the above table until such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
operating cash flows our operating cash flows are calculated by adjusting net income to reflect other significant sources and uses of cash  certain significant non cash items and timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities 
significant sources and uses of cash that are not reflected in either revenue or operating expenses include net cash flows associated with our deferred sales commission assets capitalized sales commissions paid net of contingent deferred sales charges received as well as net cash flows associated with the purchase and sale of investments within the portfolios of our consolidated funds and separate accounts proceeds received from the sale of trading investments net of cash outflows associated with the purchase of trading investments 
significant non cash items include the amortization of deferred sales commissions and other intangible assets  depreciation  stock based compensation and the net change in deferred income taxes 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million from the million reported in fiscal net income declined by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in our reconciliation of net income to cash provided by operating activities  we adjusted net income for net investment gains of million in fiscal  compared to net investment losses of million in fiscal net investment gains losses in fiscal and include impairment losses recognized on cdo investments 
we also adjusted net income for the activities of our equity method affiliates and the non controlling interests of our majority owned subsidiaries  which totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
timing differences in the cash settlement of our short term and long term receivables and payables reduced cash provided by operating activities by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
other significant sources and uses of cash include net cash outflows associated with the purchase and sale of trading investments in the portfolios of consolidated funds and separate accounts  which reduced net cash provided by operating activities by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and net cash outflows associated with deferred sales commissions  which reduced net cash provided by operating activities by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
significant non cash expenses  including the amortization of deferred sales commissions and other intangible assets  depreciation  stock based compensation and the net change in deferred income taxes  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  reflecting increases in stock based compensation and other depreciation and amortization offset by decreases in the amortization of deferred sales commissions and the net change in deferred income taxes 
the increase in other depreciation and amortization can be primarily attributed to an increase in depreciation expense associated with tenant improvements associated with our move to new corporate headquarters and the amortization of intangible assets associated with the tabs acquisition 
investing cash flows cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements  cash paid in acquisitions  the purchase of equity interests from non controlling interest holders in our majority owned subsidiaries and the purchase and sale of investments in our sponsored funds that we do not consolidate 
cash provided by investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash used for investing activities of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  additions to equipment and leasehold improvements totaled million  compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additions in fiscal and reflect tenant improvements made in conjunction with our move to new corporate headquarters 
the acquisition of tabs resulted in a net cash payment of million as more fully described in contractual obligations above 
the purchase of non controlling interests of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  represent the purchase of additional ownership interests in atlanta capital and parametric portfolio associates as more fully described in contractual obligations above 
in fiscal  net purchases and sales of available for sale investments contributed million to investing cash flows  while net purchases and sales of available for sale investments reduced investing cash flows by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in october  the company  as lender  entered into a million subordinated term note agreement the note with a sponsored privately offered equity fund 
the note earns daily interest based on the fund s cost of borrowing under its commercial paper financing facility 
upon expiration on january   the note was extended until december  and borrowings under the note were increased to million 
subject to certain conditions  the privately offered equity fund may prepay the note in whole or in part  at any time  without premium or penalty 
in fiscal  the sponsored private equity fund made payments on the note totaling million 
we currently anticipate that the note will be renewed in the first quarter of fiscal and have classified the note in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of total long term assets at october  financing cash flows financing cash flows primarily reflect distributions to non controlling interest holders of our majority owned subsidiaries and consolidated funds  the issuance and repurchase of our non voting common stock  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
financing cash flows also include proceeds from the issuance of capital stock by consolidated investment companies and cash paid to meet redemptions by non controlling interest holders of these funds 
cash used for financing activities totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of million in fiscal in fiscal  we repurchased and retired a total of million shares of our non voting common stock for million under our authorized repurchase programs and issued million shares of our non voting common stock in connection with the grant of restricted share awards  the exercise of stock options and other employee stock purchases for total proceeds of million 
we have authorization to purchase an additional million shares under our current share repurchase authorization and anticipate that future repurchases will continue to be an ongoing use of cash 
our dividends per share were in fiscal  compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
we increased our quarterly dividend by percent to per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal we currently expect to declare and pay comparable dividends on our voting and non voting common stock on a quarterly basis 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
fair value measurements we adopted the provisions of a new fair value accounting standard on november  the new accounting standard defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques to measure fair value 
this fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  an investment s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
level investments valued using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets at the reporting date 
assets classified as level include debt and equity securities held in the portfolios of consolidated funds and separate accounts  which are classified as trading  and investments in sponsored mutual funds  which are classified as available for sale 
level investments valued using observable inputs other than level unadjusted quoted market prices  such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities that are not active  and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data 
investments in this category include commercial paper  certain debt securities and investments in sponsored privately offered equity funds  which are not listed but have a net asset value that is comparable to listed mutual funds 
level investments valued using unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
level valuations are derived primarily from model based valuation techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation based on assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
investments in this category include investments in cdo entities that are measured at fair value on a non recurring basis when facts and circumstances indicate the investment has been impaired 
the fair values of cdos are derived from models created to estimate cash flows using key inputs such as default and recovery rates for the underlying portfolio of loans or other securities 
cdos measured at fair value on a non recurring basis are classified as level because at least one of the significant inputs used in the determination of fair value is not observable 
substantially all of our investments are carried at fair value  with the exception of our investments in cdo entities that have not been impaired in the current fiscal period and certain non marketable investments which are accounted for using the equity or cost method 
investments are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value 
we consider many factors  including the severity and duration of the decline in fair value below cost  our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value  and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer 
when a decline in fair value of an available for sale security is determined to be other than temporary  the loss is recognized in earnings in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
deferred sales commissions sales commissions paid to broker dealers in connection with the sale of certain classes of shares of open end funds and private funds are generally capitalized and amortized over the period during which redemptions by the purchasing shareholder are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge  which does not exceed six years from purchase 
distribution plan payments received from these funds are recorded in revenue as earned 
contingent deferred sales charges and early withdrawal charges received from redeeming shareholders of these funds are generally applied to reduce our unamortized deferred sales commission assets 
should we lose our ability to recover such sales commissions through distribution plan payments and contingent deferred sales charges  the value of these assets would immediately decline  as would future cash flows 
we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred sales commission asset for impairment on a quarterly basis 
in our impairment analysis  we compare the carrying value of the deferred sales commission asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset in the form of distribution fees over the remaining useful life of the deferred sales commission asset to determine whether impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the asset is written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows 
impairment adjustments are recognized in operating income as a component of amortization of deferred sales commissions 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisitions of atlanta capital management company llc atlanta capital  fox asset management llc fox asset management and parametric portfolio associates llc parametric portfolio associates  which share similar economic characteristics  to a single reporting unit 
management believes that the inclusion of these entities in a single reporting unit for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing most accurately reflects the synergies achieved in acquiring these entities  namely centralized distribution of similar products and services to similar clients 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we establish fair value for the purpose of impairment testing by averaging fair value established using an income approach and fair value established using a market approach 
the income approach employs a discounted cash flow model that takes into account assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value  current period actual results  and budgeted results for future periods that have been vetted by senior management at the reporting unit level 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the same fundamental pricing concepts used to calculate fair value in the acquisition due diligence process and a discount rate that takes into consideration our estimated cost of capital adjusted for the uncertainty inherent in the acquisition 
the market approach employs market multiples for comparable transactions in the financial services industry obtained from industry sources  taking into consideration the nature  scope and size of the acquired reporting unit 
estimates of fair value are established using a multiple of assets under management and current and forward multiples of both revenue and ebitda adjusted for size and performance level relative to peer companies 
a weighted average calculation is then performed  giving greater weight to fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda and lesser weight to fair value calculated as a multiple of assets under management 
fair values calculated using one year  two year and trailing twelve month revenue multiples and one year  two year and trailing twelve month ebitda multiples are each weighted percent  while fair value calculated based on a multiple of assets under management is weighted percent 
we believe that fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda is a better indicator of fair value in that these fair values provide information as to both scale and profitability 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
amortized identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and management contracts acquired 
in valuing these assets  we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates  and significant judgment is required 
we periodically review identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their respective fair values  additional impairment tests are performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
non amortizing intangible assets generally represent the cost of mutual fund management contracts acquired 
non amortizing intangible assets are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the management contracts acquired to their carrying values 
if the carrying value of a management contract acquired exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
accounting for income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates of the many jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  and we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
accounting standards requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the related interest  are adjusted regularly to reflect changing facts and circumstances 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing our taxes  changes in tax laws may result in a change to our tax position and effective tax rate 
we classify any interest or penalties incurred as a component of income tax expense 
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and to make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment takes into account our forecast of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods  our experience with the tax attributes expiring unused  tax planning alternatives and other tax considerations 
investments in cdo entities we act as collateral or investment manager for a number of cash instrument cdo entities pursuant to management agreements between us and the entities 
at october   combined assets under management in these entities upon which we earn a management fee were approximately billion 
we had combined investments in three of these entities valued at million on october  the excess of future cash flows over the initial investment at the date of purchase is recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method 
we review cash flow estimates throughout the life of each investment pool to determine whether an impairment of its investments should be recognized 
cash flow estimates are based on the underlying pool of collateral securities and take into account the overall credit quality of the issuers  the forecasted default and recovery rates and our past experience in managing similar securities 
if the updated estimate of future cash flows taking into account both timing and amounts is less than the last revised estimate  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over its fair value 
fair value is determined using current information  notably market yields and projected cash flows based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the interest 
market yields  default rates and recovery rates used in our estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools and current market conditions 
in periods when market conditions necessitate an increase in the market yield used by a market participant and or in periods of rising default rates and lower recovery rates  the fair value  and therefore carrying value  of our investments in these entities may be adversely affected 
our risk of loss in these entities is limited to the million carrying value of the investments at october  stock based compensation stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at grant date  is recognized over the relevant service period  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to dividend yield  volatility  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the expected life of the option 
many of these assumptions require management s judgment 
management must also apply judgment in developing an expectation of awards that may be forfeited 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
accounting developments variable interest entities vies in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued literature introducing a new consolidation model 
this new literature prescribes how enterprises account for and disclose their involvement with vies and other entities whose equity at risk is insufficient or lacks certain characteristics 
this new accounting changes how an entity determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a vie and whether that vie should be consolidated and requires additional disclosures 
as a result  we must comprehensively review our involvements with vies and potential vies to determine the effect on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
the new consolidation standard is effective for our fiscal year that begins on november  and for interim periods within the first annual reporting period 
earlier application is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for transfers of financial assets in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard regarding accounting for transfers of financial assets 
this new accounting standard changes the derecognition guidance for transferors of financial assets  including entities that sponsor securitizations  to align that guidance with the original intent of the accounting standard on accounting for the transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this new accounting standard also eliminates the exemption from consolidation for qualifying special purpose entities 
this new accounting standard is effective for our fiscal year that begins on november  and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period 
earlier application is prohibited 
the recognition and measurement provisions of this new accounting standard must be applied to transfers that occur on or after the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  on its consolidated financial statements 
earnings per share in june  the fasb issued a new standard regarding determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this new standard specifies that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
this new standard is effective for our fiscal year that begins on november  and will require a retrospective adjustment to all prior period earnings per share 
we will retroactively adopt the provisions of the new standard on november  the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our previously reported earnings per basic share or earnings per diluted share 
intangible assets in april  the fasb issued a new accounting standard regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this new accounting standard amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of this new accounting standard is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under superseded content 
this new accounting standard is effective for our fiscal year that begins on november  and interim periods within that fiscal year 
we do not anticipate that the provisions of this new accounting standard will have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position 
non controlling interests in december  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
the new accounting standard is intended to establish accounting and reporting standards for non controlling interests in subsidiaries and for the deconsolidation of subsidiaries

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to different types of risk  including market risk 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity and bond prices  interest rates  credit risk or currency exchange rates 
management is responsible for identifying  assessing and managing market and other risks 
in evaluating market risk  it is important to note that most of our revenue is based on the market value of assets under management 
as noted in risk factors in item a  declines of financial market values negatively impact our revenue and net income 
our primary direct exposure to equity price risk arises from our investments in sponsored equity funds  our equity interest in affiliates  investments in equity securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate and investments in equity securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
equity price risk as it relates to these investments represents the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the fund shares or underlying equity securities 
the following is a summary of the effect that a percent increase or decrease in equity prices would have on our investments subject to equity price fluctuation at october  in thousands carrying value carrying value assuming a increase carrying value assuming a decrease trading equity securities available for sale securities sponsored funds investment in affiliates total currently we have a corporate hedging program in place to hedge market price exposures on certain investments in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
as part of this program we enter into futures contracts to hedge exposure to certain equity instruments held within the portfolios of separately managed accounts 
at october   the outstanding futures contracts had an aggregate notional value of approximately million and a maturity date of december the company estimates that a percent adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately million in the value of the futures contracts positions 
our primary direct exposure to interest rate risk arises from our investment in fixed and floating rate income funds sponsored by us  debt securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate and debt securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
we considered the negative effect on pre tax interest income of a basis point percent decline in interest rates as of october  a basis point decline in interest rates is a hypothetical scenario used to demonstrate potential risk and does not represent our management s view of future market changes 
the following is a summary of the effect that a basis point percent percent decline in interest rates would have on our pre tax net income as of october  in thousands carrying value pre tax interest income impact of a basis point decline in interest rates trading debt securities available for sale securities sponsored funds total from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates associated with our debt financing 
in october  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent ten year senior notes due in conjunction with the offering  we entered into an interest rate lock intended to hedge against adverse treasury rate movements between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
at the time the debt was issued  we terminated the lock and settled the transaction in cash 
at termination  the lock was determined to be a fully effective cash flow hedge and the million settlement cost was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
there can be no assurance that our hedge instruments will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts on any future debt offerings 
our primary direct exposure to credit risk arises from our interests in the cash instrument cdo entities that are included in long term investments in our consolidated balance sheets 
as an investor in a cdo entity  we are entitled to only a residual interest in the cdo entity  making these investments highly sensitive to the default and recovery experiences of the underlying instruments held by the cdo entity 
our investments are subject to an impairment loss in the event that the cash flows generated by the collateral securities are not sufficient to allow equity holders to recover their investments 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality of collateral and reference securities and a corresponding increase in defaults  cdo entity cash flows may be adversely impacted and we may be unable to recover our investment 
our total investment in interests in cdo entities was valued at million as of october   which represents our total value at risk with respect to such entities as of october  we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we also provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states  therefore  the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
our exposure to currency movements will likely increase as our business outside of the united states grows 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes
