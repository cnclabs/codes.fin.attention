operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  business disruptions  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes 
we operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  we could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
a compliance and standards committee comprised of senior executives meets monthly to consider policy issues 
the committee reviews material customer complaints and litigation  as well as issues in operating departments  for the purpose of identifying issues that present risk exposure to either us or our customers 
the committee adopts policies to deal with these issues  which are then disseminated throughout our operations 
we have established a quality of markets committee that meets regularly to monitor the best execution activities of our trading departments as they relate to customer orders 
this committee is comprised of representatives from the otc trading  listed trading  options  municipal trading  taxable trading  compliance and legal departments and is under the direction of one of our senior officers 
this committee reviews reports from the respective departments listed above and recommends action for improvement when necessary 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of pcg customer claims  the possibility of sizable adverse legal judgments and non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly demanding over the past several years and we  as well as others in the industry  have been directly affected by this increased regulatory scrutiny 
we have comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  extension of credit  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
we have designated anti money laundering compliance officers in each of our subsidiaries who monitor compliance with regulations adopted under the usa patriot act 
we act as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings 
particularly when acting as lead or co lead manager  we have financial and legal exposure 
to manage this exposure  a committee of senior executives review proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation 
our banking activities are highly regulated and subject to impact from changes in banking laws and regulations  including unanticipated rulings 
present economic conditions have led to rapid introduction of significant regulatory programs or changes affecting consumer protection and disclosure requirements  financial reporting and planned regulatory restructuring 
regulations and related requirements including the bank secrecy act and usa patriot act  as well as new regulatory or government programs  are closely monitored and acted upon to ensure a timely response 
our major business units have compliance departments that are responsible for regularly reviewing and revising compliance and supervisory procedures to conform to changes in applicable regulations 
we have experienced an increase in the number of claims as a result of the market downturn and the illiquidity of ars 
while these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing  we do  at a minimum  incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims
