executive overview cognex corporation is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks  primarily in manufacturing processes  where vision is required 
our modular vision systems division mvsd specializes in machine vision systems that are used to automate the manufacturing of discrete items  while our surface inspection systems division sisd specializes in machine vision systems that are used to inspect the surfaces of materials processed in a continuous fashion 
in addition to product revenue derived from the sale of machine vision systems  the company also generates revenue by providing maintenance and support  training  consulting  and installation services to its customers 
our customers can be classified into three primary markets discrete factory automation  semiconductor and electronics capital equipment  and surface inspection 
discrete factory automation customers purchase cognex vision products and incorporate them into their manufacturing processes 
virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision  and therefore  this segment includes a broad base of customers across a variety of industries  including automotive  consumer electronics  food and beverage  health and beauty  medical devices  packaging  and pharmaceutical 
sales to discrete factory automation customers represented approximately of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in semiconductor and electronics capital equipment manufacturers purchase cognex vision products and integrate them into the automation equipment that they manufacture and then sell to their 
table of contents customers to either make semiconductor chips or assemble printed circuit boards 
demand from these capital equipment manufacturers has historically been highly cyclical  with periods of investment followed by downturn 
this market has been in a prolonged downturn since early sales to semiconductor and electronics capital equipment manufacturers represented approximately of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in surface inspection customers are manufacturers of materials processed in a continuous fashion  such as metals  paper  non wovens  plastics  and glass 
these customers need sophisticated machine vision to detect and classify defects on the surfaces of those materials as they are being processed at high speeds 
surface inspection sales represented approximately of total revenue in  compared to of total revenue in revenue for the year ended december  totaled  representing an increase from the prior year 
this increase was due to higher sales to discrete factory automation and surface inspection customers 
despite the higher revenue  operating income decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in  as a result of higher operating expenses due to investments intended to grow the discrete factory automation business 
income per share from continuing operations increased to per diluted share in from per diluted share in due to the impact of favorable discrete tax events  higher foreign currency gains  and lower weighted average shares as a result of the company s stock repurchase programs 
in july  the company sold all of the assets of its lane departure warning business for  in cash 
management classified the assets of this business as held for sale as of june  and recorded a  impairment loss in the second quarter of relating to the sale of this business 
loss from discontinued operations amounted to per diluted share in the company s revenue and profitability have been and will continue to be impacted by worldwide economic conditions  including the slowing global economies  the credit market crisis  and declining business confidence 
these factors have contributed to delayed  reduced  or canceled capital spending by many companies  including many of the company s current and potential customers 
while demand from the company s customers in the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market has been declining since due to cyclicality in these industries as well as competitive market pressures  demand from the company s factory automation customers was strong in the first half of  particularly in europe and asia 
factory automation demand began to be impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown in the third quarter of  and revenue from this market was down in the fourth quarter of from the prior quarter 
while revenue  to date  from the company s surface inspection customers has not been significantly impacted by current global economic conditions  long lead times are typical in this business  and therefore  the impact on this market may be delayed 
while we cannot predict how long the current worldwide economic slowdown will last or how severely it will impact each of the company s three markets  we anticipate revenue and profitability will decline in the company took actions in the fourth quarter of  including a reduction in force  in order to better align its expenses to the lower revenue expectations for

sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees at fair value 
sfas no 
r was adopted by the company on january  using the modified prospective method in which compensation expense is recognized beginning on the effective date 
under this transition method  compensation expense recognized after january  includes compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated under sfas no 
 and compensation expense for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated under sfas no 
r 
the fair values of stock options granted after january  were estimated on the grant date using a binomial lattice model 
the fair values of options granted prior to january  were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model for footnote disclosure under sfas no 
we believe that a binomial lattice model results in a better estimate of fair value because it identifies patterns of exercises based on triggering events  tying the results to possible future events instead of a single path of actual historical events

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue revenue for the year ended december  increased by  or  from the prior year due to higher sales to discrete factory automation and surface inspection customers 
discrete factory automation market sales to manufacturing customers in the discrete factory automation area  which are included in the company s mvsd segment  represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in sales to these customers increased by  or  from the prior year 
a weaker us dollar compared to the prior year contributed to the higher revenue  as sales denominated in foreign currencies were translated to us dollars 
excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on revenue  sales to factory automation customers increased by  or  from the prior year 
sales of the company s in sight and dataman products  which are sold to customers in a variety of industries around the world  increased from the company has invested in new product offerings and additional sales personnel  particularly in china and eastern europe  for the factory automation market with the goal of growing this business 
despite these investments  demand from the company s factory automation customers began to be impacted by the worldwide economic slowdown in the third quarter of  and revenue from this market was down in the fourth quarter of from the prior quarter 
while we cannot predict how long the current worldwide economic slowdown will last or how severely it will impact the factory automation market  we anticipate revenue for this market will be down for the first quarter of compared to both the fourth quarter and first quarter of semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market sales to customers who make automation equipment for the semiconductor and electronics industries  which are included in the company s mvsd segment  represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in sales to these customers decreased by  or  from the prior year due to industry cyclicality as well as competitive market pressures 
in recent years  the competitive landscape in this market has changed  and price and flexibility of purchasing hardware from other vendors have become more important factors in our customers purchasing decisions 
cognex has addressed this market change by introducing software only products  however  the average selling price of these offerings is significantly lower than for a complete vision system  and therefore  we expect this trend to have a negative impact on our revenue in this market 
as a result of the continued impact of a prolonged industry downturn and pricing pressure  together with current worldwide economic conditions  we expect this business to continue to decline in the first quarter of surface inspection market sales to surface inspection customers  which comprise the company s sisd segment  represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in revenue from these customers increased by  or  from the prior year 
although some of this increase in revenue from the prior year is due to the timing of customer orders  system deliveries  and installations  as well as the impact of revenue deferrals  we have also gained market share within the past year  particularly in the metals industry 
in addition  the company has seen growth in revenues from emerging markets in asia  eastern europe  and latin america 
while revenue  to date  from the company s surface inspection customers has not been significantly impacted by current worldwide economic conditions  long lead times are typical in this business  and therefore  the impact on this market may be delayed 

table of contents product revenue product revenue increased by  or  from the prior year due to a higher volume of vision systems sold to discrete factory automation and surface inspection customers 
within the discrete factory automation market  the majority of this higher volume came from in sight and dataman products 
the favorable impact of the higher volume was partially offset by lower average selling prices  primarily from the transition to software only products 
service revenue service revenue  which is derived from the sale of maintenance and support  education  consulting  and installation services  decreased by  or  from the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower maintenance and support revenue  as well as lower consulting revenue 
we expect the declining trend in maintenance and support revenue to continue as we introduce new products and functionality that make vision easier to use and require less maintenance and support 
service revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for compared to for this increase was primarily due to a higher percentage of total revenue from the sale of products  which have higher margins than the sale of services 
mvsd margin mvsd gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in due to a greater percentage of revenue from the sale of products  which have higher margins than the sale of services 
mvsd product gross margin as a percentage of revenue was relatively flat  as the favorable impact of the mix of products sold and the higher product revenue was offset by an increase in new product introduction costs that were incurred to support the release of several new products in product mix had a positive impact on the margin in because a higher percentage of product revenue came from products with relatively higher margins including in sight  dataman  and software only products 
sisd margin sisd gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in this increase was due to the impact of significantly higher product revenue on relatively flat manufacturing overhead costs  as well as a greater percentage of revenue from the sale of products  which have higher margins than the sale of services 
product margin product gross margin as a percentage of revenue was consistent at in both and mvsd and sisd product margins as a percentage of revenue were either flat with or higher than the prior year  however  a greater percentage of product revenue came from the sale of lower margin surface inspection systems resulting in an overall flat margin 
service margin service gross margin as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in although support costs declined from the prior year due to improvements in product ease of use and lower reserves against mvsd service inventory  service revenue declined at a greater rate 

table of contents operating expenses research  development  and engineering expenses research  development  and engineering rd e expenses increased by  or  from the prior year 
mvsd rd e expenses increased by  or  while sisd rd e expenses were relatively flat 
the increase in mvsd rd e expenses was due primarily to higher personnel related costs such as salaries  fringe benefits  and travel to support new product initiatives 
the company has invested in developing new products and functionality that make vision easier to use and more affordable  and therefore  available to a broader base of customers in order to grow factory automation revenue 
in  the company made significant rd e investments in its id products business  which includes the dataman product line  as we believe this business has high growth potential 
in addition  the company has invested in the development of a vision system ie imager  analog to digital converter  vision processing  and camera peripherals on a semiconductor chip 
the development of this vision system on a chip is in the early stages and we expect the commercialization of this product to take at least several years 
rd e expenses as a percentage of revenue were in both and we believe that a continued commitment to rd e activities is essential in order to maintain or achieve product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore  we expect to continue to make significant rd e investments in the future 
in addition  we consider our ability to accelerate time to market for new products critical to our revenue growth 
although we target our rd e spending to be between and of revenue  this percentage is impacted by revenue levels 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses increased by  or  from the prior year 
mvsd sg a expenses increased by  or  while sisd sg a expenses increased by  or 
corporate expenses that are not allocated to either division decreased by  or 
the increase in mvsd sg a expenses was due primarily to higher personnel related costs such as salaries  fringe benefits  commissions  and travel resulting from the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  increased expenses related to sales force training  and increased rental expense from opening new sales offices 
all of these investments were intended to grow factory automation revenue 
in addition  a weaker us dollar compared to the prior year resulted in higher sg a costs when expenses of the company s foreign operations were translated to us dollars 
an intangible asset impairment charge incurred in the third quarter of  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report and higher amortization expense  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report on that intangible asset recorded in the fourth quarter of also contributed to the increase in expenses 
these increases were partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense  due to a credit recorded in the first quarter of for forfeited stock options 
the increase in sisd sg a expenses was principally due to higher personnel related costs such as salaries  fringe benefits  commissions  and travel resulting from additional sales personnel 
in addition  a weaker us dollar compared to the prior year resulted in higher sg a costs when expenses of the company s foreign operations were translated to us dollars 
the decrease in corporate expenses was due primarily to lower legal fees for patent infringement actions  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report and lower stock based compensation expense  due to a credit recorded in the first quarter of for forfeited stock options  partially offset by higher tax service fees related to a japanese tax audit  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report 

table of contents restructuring charge in november  the company announced the closure of its facility in duluth  georgia scheduled for mid  which the company anticipates will result in long term cost savings 
this facility included a distribution center for mvsd customers located in the americas  an engineering group dedicated to supporting the company s mvsd vision systems products  a sales training and support group  as well as a team of finance support staff 
the distribution center will be consolidated into the company s headquarters in natick  massachusetts resulting in a single distribution center for mvsd customers located in the americas 
although a portion of the engineering and sales training and support positions will be transferred to another location  the majority of these positions  and all of the finance positions  will be eliminated 
the company anticipates that the restructuring costs will offset the expense savings in  however  beginning in  the company expects to achieve expense savings of approximately  per year 
these savings will be realized in cost of revenue  research  development  and engineering expenses  and selling  general  and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
the company estimates the total restructuring charge to be approximately  of which  was recorded in the fourth quarter of and included in restructuring charge on the consolidated statements of operations in the mvsd segment 
the remainder of the costs will be recognized primarily during the first half of the following table summarizes the restructuring plan in thousands total amount incurred in expected to be year ended incurred december  one time termination benefits contract termination costs other associated costs one time termination benefits include severance and retention bonuses for employees whom either were terminated or were notified they will be terminated at a future date 
severance and retention bonuses for these employees will be recognized over the service period 
contract termination costs include rental payments for the duluth  georgia facility that will be incurred after the distribution activities are transferred to natick  massachusetts  for which the company will not receive an economic benefit 
these contract termination costs will be recognized when the company ceases to use the georgia facility 
other associated costs include salaries of employees performing duplicative roles during the transition  travel and transportation expenses between georgia and massachusetts related to closure of the georgia facility  as well as outplacement services for the terminated employees 
these costs will be recognized when the services are performed 
the following table summarizes the activity in the company s restructuring reserve  which is included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets in thousands balance at january  restructuring charges cash payments balance at december  nonoperating income expense the company recorded foreign currency gains of  in compared to  in the foreign currency gains in each year resulted primarily from the revaluation and settlement of accounts receivable balances that are reported in one currency and collected in another 
although the foreign currency exposure of these accounts receivable is largely hedged through the use of forward contracts  
table of contents this hedging program depends upon forecasts of sales and collections  and therefore  gains or losses on the underlying receivables may not perfectly offset losses or gains on the contracts 
beginning late in the third quarter of  both the us dollar and the japanese yen strengthened considerably versus the euro  resulting in foreign currency gains on the company s irish subsidiary s books when us dollar and japanese yen accounts receivable were revalued and collected 
the japanese yen also strengthened versus the us dollar throughout  resulting in foreign currency gains on the company s us subsidiary s books when japanese yen accounts receivable were revalued and collected during the year 
gains from the revaluation and settlement of intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected or paid in another also contributed to the foreign currency gain in the gain in was partially offset by losses from the revaluation and settlement of intercompany balances that are reported in one currency and collected or paid in another 
investment income decreased by  or  from the prior year 
this decrease was due to declining yields on the company s portfolio of debt securities  partially offset by more of the company s excess cash invested in interest bearing accounts 
the company recorded other income of  in compared to other expense of  in the company recorded  of other income in the fourth quarter of related to the settlement of a legal claim 
the company also recorded  of other income in the first quarter of upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations relating to a tax holiday  during which time  the company collected value added taxes from customers that were not required to be remitted to the government authority 
other income expense also includes rental income  net of associated expenses  from leasing buildings adjacent to the company s corporate headquarters 
net rental income increased from the prior year due to the purchase of additional property adjacent to the company s headquarters during the second quarter of that is generating rental income for the company 
income tax expense on continuing operations the company s effective tax rate on continuing operations for was compared to for the effective tax rate for included the impact of the following discrete tax events a decrease in tax expense of  from the expiration of the statute of limitations and the final settlement with the internal revenue service for an audit of tax years through  an increase in tax expense of  from the final true up of the prior year s tax accrual upon filing the actual tax returns  an increase in tax expense of  for a capital loss reserve  and an increase in tax expense of  resulting from a reduction of certain deferred state tax assets reflecting a recent tax rate change in massachusetts 
these discrete events decreased the effective tax rate in from to 
the effective tax rate for included the impact of the following discrete tax events an increase to fin liabilities of  for identified tax exposures  an increase in tax expense of  to finalize the competent authority settlement between the united states and japanese taxing authorities  an increase in tax expense of  for capital loss carryforwards that will not be utilized  and a decrease in tax expense of  from the final true up of the prior year s tax accrual upon filing the actual tax returns 
these discrete events increased the effective tax rate in from to 
the effective tax rate excluding discrete tax events increased from to as a result of more of the company s profits being earned in higher tax jurisdictions  as well as less of the company s investment income coming from tax exempt investment vehicles 
discontinued operations in july  the company sold all of the assets of its lane departure warning business to takata holdings inc for  in cash 
the company entered the lane departure warning business in may with the acquisition of assistware technology  inc  a small company that had developed a vision system that 
table of contents could provide a warning to drivers when their vehicle was about to inadvertently cross a lane 
after the purchase  the company invested additional funds to commercialize assistware s product and to establish a business developing and selling lane departure warning products for driver assistance 
this business was reported under the company s mvsd segment  but was never integrated into other cognex businesses 
during the second quarter of  the company determined that this business did not fit the company s business model  primarily because car and truck manufacturers want to work exclusively with their existing tier one suppliers and  although these suppliers have expressed interest in the company s vision technology  they would require access to and control of the company s proprietary software 
accordingly  the company accepted an offer from one of these suppliers and sold the lane departure warning business 
management concluded that the assets of the lane departure warning business met all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of june  accordingly  the company recorded a  loss in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying amount of these assets down to their fair value less costs to sell 
management also concluded that the disposal group met the criteria of a discontinued operation  and has presented the loss from operations of this discontinued business separate from continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  correction of prior period misstatements related to unsubstantiated orders in japan in the second quarter of  the company recorded an adjustment to reduce revenue by  to correct an overstatement of revenue reported in the first quarter of amounting to  and in the fourth quarter of amounting to  upon investigation  we concluded that these previously reported revenues were from unsubstantiated customer orders resulting in the shipment of product and the recording of revenue with no evidence of an arrangement with the customer 
these fictitious orders were associated with semiconductor and electronics capital equipment customers in japan 
we determined that these amounts were not material to the results reported in the second quarter of  the first quarter of  or the fourth quarter of  and therefore  corrected these misstatements in the second quarter of these misstatements had no material impact on management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations in either or revenue revenue for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower sales to customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries  partially offset by higher sales to factory automation customers in a variety of general manufacturing industries 
the decline in sales to customers in the electronics industry included lower demand from oems who make capital equipment used in the assembly of printed circuit boards  as well as lower demand from end users who manufacture consumer electronics  such as disk drives and personal computers 
discrete factory automation market sales to manufacturing customers in the discrete factory automation area  which are included in the company s mvsd segment  represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in  and increased by  or  from the prior year 
sales of the company s in sight  dataman  and checker vision products  which are sold to customers in a wide variety of industries  increased from these increases were partially offset by lower sales of the company s vision software products to factory automation customers in the electronics industry 
geographically  revenue increased in europe and the americas where we serve a broader base of industries  while revenue from this sector decreased in japan and southeast asia where we have large concentrations of customers in the electronics industry 

table of contents semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market sales to customers who make automation equipment for the semiconductor and electronics industries  which are included in the company s mvsd segment  represented of total revenue in compared to of total revenue in  and decreased by  or  from the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to industry cyclicality  and to a lesser extent  to several end of life orders received in for legacy products 
geographically  revenue decreased in all of the company s major regions  but most significantly in japan where many of the company s semiconductor and electronics capital equipment customers are located 
revenue from this sector had been gradually declining since the first quarter of surface inspection market sales to surface inspection customers  which comprise the company s sisd segment  represented of total revenue in both and  and declined by  or  from the prior year 
this decrease was due to the deferral of product revenue during for surface inspection systems that were shipped to customers  but were part of multiple element arrangements for which we did not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for all of the undelivered elements 
in these instances  we are required to defer product revenue related to the system that shipped until all of the elements in the arrangement have been delivered to the customer or we have vsoe of fair value for the remaining obligations 
product revenue product revenue decreased to  in from  in this decrease was due primarily to a lower volume of modular vision systems sold to semiconductor and electronics capital equipment manufacturers  as well as factory automation customers in the electronics industry 
to a lesser extent  the decline in product revenue was also due to the shift in revenue mix from our vision software products that offer advanced programming capabilities to our easier to use and lower priced vision sensors and industrial id readers 
in addition  within our vision software product offerings we experienced a trend in customers purchasing only software from the company to use with the hardware of their choice  and although this trend did not contribute significantly to the decline in revenue in  we expect the shift to software only sales to continue in service revenue service revenue  which is derived from the sale of maintenance and support  training  consulting  and installation services  increased to  in from  in this increase was due to higher revenue generated by maintenance and support programs 
service revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue to in from in gross margin gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for compared to for this decrease was primarily due to higher mvsd excess and obsolete inventory provisions recorded in than  as well as the impact of the lower mvsd sales volume 
mvsd margin mvsd gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for compared to for during  the company recorded provisions for excess and obsolete mvsd inventory totaling  resulting from lower actual demand than was previously estimated as part of our material requirements forecasts  together with lower estimates of future demand from both semiconductor and electronics capital equipment and discrete factory automation customers 
similar provisions were not material during the remaining decrease from the prior year was due to the lower mvsd sales volume while manufacturing overhead costs remained relatively flat 
manufacturing overhead costs were relatively consistent in each 
table of contents year  as costs related to a higher number of new product introductions in were offset by start up costs incurred in the first half of when the company shifted a portion of its manufacturing operations from massachusetts to ireland 
these decreases to gross margin were partially offset by a  benefit recorded to mvsd cost of product revenue during the fourth quarter of resulting from the reversal of accrued inventory purchase commitments upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations 
sisd margin sisd gross margin as a percentage of revenue was consistent at for both and although revenue was slightly lower and warranty provisions were higher than the prior year  the impact of these items was offset by lower material costs 
product margin product gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for compared to for this decrease was due principally to the higher excess and obsolete inventory provisions and lower sales volume at mvsd  as more fully described in the mvsd margin section above 
service margin service gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for compared to for this increase was due to higher revenue generated by maintenance and support programs  without a corresponding increase in service costs 
operating expenses research  development  and engineering expenses research  development  and engineering rd e expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ended december  mvsd rd e expenses increased  or  from the prior year primarily due to higher personnel related costs such as employee salaries  fringe benefits  contract labor  and travel resulting from the hiring of additional engineering resources  as well as higher outside services  and patent related costs  all to support new product initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by lower company bonus accruals  due to a lower consolidated operating income margin on which the company s bonus plan is based  as well as lower stock based compensation expense

accordingly  the company accepted an offer from one of these suppliers and sold the lane departure warning business 
management concluded that the assets of the lane departure warning business met all of the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of june  management also concluded that the disposal group met the criteria of a discontinued operation  and has presented the loss from operations of this discontinued business separate from continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically been able to generate positive cash flow from operations  which has funded its operating activities and other cash requirements and has resulted in an accumulated cash  cash equivalent  and investment balance of  at december   representing of shareholders equity 
the company has established guidelines relative to credit ratings  diversification  and maturities of its investments that maintain liquidity 
the company s cash requirements during the year ended december  were met with its existing cash  cash equivalent  and investment balances  as well as positive cash flow from operations 
cash requirements primarily consisted of operating activities  capital expenditures  the repurchase of common stock  and the payment of dividends 
capital expenditures in totaled  and consisted primarily of expenditures for computer hardware and software  manufacturing test equipment for new product introductions  costs to fit up a new manufacturing and distribution center in ireland  and capital improvements to rental properties 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately  in  with the increase from due to the construction of a new distribution center at the company s natick  massachusetts headquarters during the first half of the company believes that its existing cash  cash equivalent  and investment balances  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet its operating  investing  and financing activities in at december   the company had approximately  in either cash or investments that could be converted into cash 
in addition  cognex has no long term debt and we do not anticipate needing debt financing in the near future 
we believe that our strong financial condition and historically high gross margins put us in a relatively good position to weather a prolonged economic downturn

acquisitions the company s business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision applications through the acquisition of businesses and technologies  which may result in significant cash outlays in the future 
derivative instruments in certain instances  the company enters into forward contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
although these instruments may be effective in minimizing foreign currency gains or losses recorded in current operations or shareholders equity  significant cash inflows or outflows may result when these instruments are settled 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or circumstances resulting in charges that could be material in future reporting periods 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in order to recognize revenue  the company requires that a signed customer contract or purchase order is received  the fee from the arrangement is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
assuming that these criteria have been met  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  revenue from maintenance and support programs is recognized ratably over the program period  revenue from training and consulting services is recognized over the period that the services are provided  and revenue from installation services is recognized when the customer has signed off that the installation is complete 
if the arrangement contains customer specified acceptance criteria  then revenue is deferred until we can demonstrate that the customer s criteria have been met 
certain of the company s arrangements include multiple elements that provide the customer with a combination of product or service deliverables 
the fee from the arrangement is allocated to each of the undelivered elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  which is limited to the price charged when the same element is sold separately  with the residual value from the arrangement allocated to the delivered element 
the portion of the fee that is allocated to each element is then recognized as revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met with respect to that element 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all of the undelivered elements  then all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until all of the elements have been delivered to the customer or we have vsoe of fair value for the remaining obligations 

table of contents while the company applies the guidance of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  management exercises judgment in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized each period 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  assessing the probability of collecting the receivable  assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  assessing whether customer specified acceptance criteria are substantive in nature  and assessing whether vsoe of fair value has been established for undelivered elements 
investments at december   the company s investment balance totaled  of which  consisted of municipal bonds 
debt securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  recorded in shareholders equity as other comprehensive income loss 
at december   the company s portfolio of debt securities had net unrealized gains totaling  the company s municipal bond portfolio includes  in auction rate securities that had a failed auction during an auction rate failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not do so because of a lack of buying demand 
to date  the company has collected all interest payable on these securities when due and believes the full principal value of these securities will ultimately be recovered 
as a result of this lack of buying demand  the company was unable to corroborate the fair value of these investments with observable market data 
accordingly  at december   the company recorded these investments at their principal value  which represents management s best estimate of the fair value 
the remaining investment balance of  represented a limited partnership interest in venrock associates iii  lp  a venture capital fund 
a director of the company is a managing general partner of venrock associates 
the company s limited partnership interest is accounted for using the cost method because our investment is less than of the partnership and we have no influence over the partnership s operating and financial policies 
at december   the carrying value of this investment was  compared to an estimated fair value of  the partnership s investments consist of a mix of young and emerging companies 
the current worldwide economic slowdown and the credit market crisis will likely make the environment for these startups much less forgiving 
as a result  it is possible that some of the younger companies in the portfolio that require capital investments to fund their current operations may not be as well prepared to survive this slowdown as would a more mature company 
these factors will likely impact the fair value of the companies in the partnership s portfolio and may result in an impairment charge in a future period 
the fair value of the company s limited partnership interest is based upon valuations of the partnership s investments as determined by the general partner 
management understands that the general partner adjusts the investment valuations at least quarterly to reflect both realized and unrealized gains and losses on partnership investments 
securities of public companies are valued at market  subject to appropriate discounts to reflect limitations on liquidity 
securities of private companies are valued at an estimated fair value  which initially is at cost  adjusted for subsequent transactions that indicate a higher or lower value is warranted 
the value of private securities may be discounted when  in the general partner s judgment  the carrying value of such securities has been impaired by specific events 
management monitors the carrying value of its investments compared to their fair value to determine whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
in considering whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider many factors  both qualitative and quantitative in nature 
some of these factors include the duration and extent of the fair value decline  the length of the company s commitment to the investment  and general economic  stock market  and interest rate trends 
in the case of the company s limited partnership investment  specific communications from the general partner are also considered in this evaluation 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge would be recorded in current operations 
there were no other than temporary impairments of investments in   or if the fair value of the company s limited partnership 
table of contents interest decreases below its current carrying value  which would represent a decline of greater than  the company may be required to record an impairment charge related to this asset 
accounts receivable the company maintains reserves against its accounts receivable for potential credit losses 
ongoing credit evaluations of customers are performed and the company has historically not experienced significant losses related to the collection of its accounts receivable 
allowances for specific accounts determined to be at risk for collection are estimated by management taking into account the length of time the receivable has been outstanding  the customer s current ability to pay its obligations to the company  general economic and industry conditions  as well as various other factors 
the recent global economic slowdown may result in longer payment cycles and challenges in collecting accounts receivable balances  which make these estimates more judgmental 
an adverse change in any of these factors could result in higher than expected customer defaults and may result in the need for additional bad debt provisions 
at december   the company s reserve against accounts receivable was  or of the gross accounts receivable balance 
a difference in the reserve against accounts receivable at december  would have affected net income by approximately  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
management estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions  and records reserves to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value 
the recent global economic slowdown makes these assumptions about future demand more judgmental 
among the risks associated with the introduction of new products are difficulty predicting customer demand and effectively managing inventory levels to ensure adequate supply of the new product and avoid excess supply of the legacy product 
in addition  we may strategically enter into non cancelable commitments with vendors to purchase materials for products in advance of demand in order to take advantage of favorable pricing or address concerns about the availability of future supplies 
at december   the company s reserve for excess and obsolete inventory totaled  or of the gross inventory balance 
a difference in inventory reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately  long lived assets the company has long lived assets including property  plant  and equipment  as well as acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
these assets are susceptible to shortened estimated useful lives and changes in fair value due to changes in their use  market or economic changes  or other events or circumstances 
in addition  the fair value of goodwill is susceptible to changes in the fair value of the reporting units in which the goodwill resides  which are also reportable segments 
management evaluates the potential impairment of its long lived assets annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include historical or projected results that are less than the assumptions used in the original valuation of the acquired asset  a change in the company s business strategy or its use of the acquired asset  negative economic or industry trends  or a decline in the company s market capitalization relative to the net book value of its reporting segments 
the company performs a two step impairment test on the goodwill for its two reporting segments in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year 
step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  step two is required to determine if there is an impairment of the goodwill 
step two compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using the income approach based on a discounted cash flow model 
in addition  the company uses the market approach  which compares the reporting unit to publicly traded companies and transactions involving similar businesses  to support the conclusions based on the income approach 
the income approach 
table of contents requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues  expenses  capital expenditures  and working capital  as well as discount factors and income tax rates 
current worldwide economic conditions make these assumptions and estimates more judgmental 
the company completed its annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of and concluded that no impairment charge was required as of that date 
changes in the assumptions listed above could result in an impairment of goodwill in future periods 
a decrease in projected revenue for the mvsd reporting segment would not have had an impact on the results of our impairment analysis for that segment 
the mvsd reporting segment had a goodwill balance of  as of december  the company would not be required to perform a step two analysis for the sisd reporting segment even if revenues for the projection period remained flat with the sisd reporting segment had a goodwill balance of  as of december  the company reviews the potential impairment of other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year by reviewing the assumptions about revenues and expenses used in the original valuation of the asset compared to the historical and projected performance of the asset 
if this review  or another event or circumstance  indicates the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable  the company assesses the recoverability of the asset by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the sum of its undiscounted future cash flows 
if the carrying value exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  the company compares the fair value of the intangible asset to the carrying value and records an impairment loss for the difference 
the company estimates the fair value of the intangible asset using the income approach based on a discounted cash flow model 
the income approach requires the use of many assumptions and estimates including future revenues and expenses  as well as discount factors and income tax rates 
the company recorded an impairment loss on one of its intangible assets in the third quarter of based on lower revenue projections 
changes in the assumptions above could result in an impairment of intangible assets in future periods 
at december   the company had intangible assets of  related primarily to acquired distribution networks  customer contracts and relationships  and completed technologies 
warranty obligations the company records the estimated cost of fulfilling product warranties at the time of sale based upon historical costs to fulfill claims 
obligations may also be recorded subsequent to the time of sale whenever specific events or circumstances impacting product quality become known that would not have been taken into account using historical data 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers and third party contract manufacturers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
an adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional warranty provisions 
at december   the company s accrued warranty obligations amounted to  a difference in accrued warranty obligations at december  would have affected net income by approximately  contingencies estimated losses from contingencies are accrued by management based upon the likelihood of a loss and the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
estimating potential losses  or even a range of losses  is difficult and involves a great deal of judgment 
management relies primarily on assessments made by its internal and external legal counsel to make our determination as to whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be recorded or disclosed 
should the resolution of a contingency result in a loss that we did not accrue because management did not believe that the loss was probable or capable of being reasonably estimated  then this loss would result in a charge to income in the period the contingency was resolved 
the company did not have any significant accrued contingencies at december  
table of contents stock based compensation the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment on january   which requires compensation expense to be recognized for all stock option grants 
determining the appropriate valuation model and estimating the fair values of these grants requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  dividend yields  and forfeiture rates 
the expected volatility assumption is based partially on the historical volatility of the company s common stock  which may or may not be a true indicator of future volatility  particularly as the company continues to seek to diversify its customer base 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair values of stock option grants represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of judgment 
as a result  if factors change and different assumptions are used  stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company recorded in the current period 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the company has established reserves for uncertain tax positions by applying the more likely than not criteria of fin  under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority 
all tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification  such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company had net deferred tax assets of  primarily resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
management has evaluated the realizability of these deferred tax assets and has determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized  net of any established reserves 
in reaching this conclusion  we have evaluated relevant criteria  including the company s historical profitability  current projections of future profitability  and the lives of tax credits  net operating and capital losses  and other carryforwards  certain of which have indefinite lives 
should the company fail to generate sufficient pre tax profits in future periods  we may be required to record material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a charge to income in the period of determination 
derivative instruments in certain instances  the company enters into forward contracts and other derivative instruments to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
these contracts are used to minimize foreign currency gains or losses  as the gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the losses or gains on the underlying exposures 
the company does not engage in foreign currency speculation 
administering the company s foreign currency risk management program requires the use of estimates and the application of judgment  including compiling forecasts of transaction activity denominated in various currencies 
the failure to identify foreign currency exposures and construct effective hedges may result in material foreign currency gains or losses

for the first quarter of item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company faces exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  as a significant portion of its revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries or the reporting currency of the company  which is the us dollar 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
the company evaluates its foreign currency exposures on an ongoing basis and makes adjustments to its foreign currency risk management program as circumstances change 
the failure to identify new exposures and hedge them in an effective manner may result in material foreign currency gains or losses 
the company faces two types of foreign currency exchange rate exposures transactional currency functional currency exchange rate exposures from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary for example  a japanese yen receivable on the company s irish subsidiary s books for which the functional currency is the euro  and functional currency reporting currency exchange rate exposures from transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is the reporting currency of the company 

table of contents the company enters into forward contracts to hedge the transactional currency functional currency exposure of its irish subsidiary s receivables denominated in us dollars and japanese yen 
forward contracts to exchange  japanese yen for euros at a weighted average settlement price of yen euro and contracts to exchange  us dollars for euros at a weighted average settlement price of usd euro  both with terms between one and six months  were outstanding at december  these instruments at fair value had a loss of  at december  these forward contracts are used to minimize foreign currency gains or losses  as the gains or losses on these contracts are intended to offset the losses or gains on the underlying exposures 
the company does not engage in foreign currency speculation 
the success of this hedging program depends upon forecasts of sales and collections denominated in us dollars and japanese yen 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated foreign currency gains or losses that could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in addition to us dollar and japanese yen receivables on the company s irish subsidiary s books that are hedged with forward contracts  the company faces other transactional currency functional currency exposures that it does not presently hedge 
these exposures include cash balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary  receivables denominated in euro or japanese yen on the books of a us entity  and intercompany balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary 
the company presently manages its intercompany foreign currency risk by transferring cash to minimize intercompany balances at the end of each month  although in the past  the company has also managed this risk by entering into forward contracts to hedge this exposure 
the company s functional currency reporting currency exchange rate exposures result from revenues and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the only foreign currencies in which a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated are the euro and the japanese yen 
the company s predominant currency of sale is the us dollar in the americas and southeast asia  the euro in europe  and the yen in japan 
we estimate that approximately of our sales in were invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar  and we expect sales denominated in foreign currencies to continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
while we also have expenses denominated in these same foreign currencies  the impact on revenues has historically been  and is expected to continue to be  greater than the offsetting impact on expenses 
therefore  in times when the us dollar strengthens in relation to these foreign currencies  we would expect to report a net decrease in operating income 
conversely  in times when the us dollar weakens in relation to these foreign currencies  we would expect to report a net increase in operating income 
interest rate risk the company s investment portfolio includes municipal bonds 
debt securities with original maturities greater than three months are designated as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
at december   the fair value of the company s portfolio of debt securities amounted to  with principal amounts totaling  maturities that do not exceed three years  and a yield to maturity of 
differences between the fair value and principal amounts of the company s portfolio of debt securities are primarily attributable to discounts and premiums arising at the acquisition date  as well as unrealized gains and losses at the balance sheet date 
given the relatively short maturities and investment grade quality of the company s portfolio of debt securities at december   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of these instruments 
as a result  the company does not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in the fair value of the company s portfolio of debt securities arising from selected potential changes in interest rates in thousands

as a result of this lack of buying demand  the company was unable to corroborate the fair value of these investments with observable market data 
accordingly  at december  the company recorded these investments at their principal value  which represents management s best estimate of the fair value 
the company s investment portfolio also includes a limited partnership interest in venrock associates iii  lp  a venture capital fund with an investment focus on information technology and health care and life sciences 
the majority of the partnership s portfolio consists of investments in early stage  private companies characterized by a high degree of risk  volatility  and illiquidity 
a director of the company is a managing general partner of venrock associates

at december   the carrying value of this investment was  compared to an estimated fair value  as determined by the general partner  of  should the fair value of this investment decline in future periods below its carrying value  management will determine whether this decline is other than temporary and future impairment charges may be required
