item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of items  uncertainties  assumptions and risks associated with these statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following workers compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers compensation  vehicular collisions  accidents and cargo claims 
most of our insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 
our policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of months from each policy period inception 
this contractual premium adjustment factor is used to convert 
table of contents the self insured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims 
our estimated accrual of ultimate losses includes these premium adjustment factors as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occur 
the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates 
during and  we were self insured for  per occurrence for personal injury  property damage and workers compensation 
for  we were self insured for  per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and million for workers compensation 
we have renewed our policies for with substantially the same terms as our policies 
our claims accrual policy for all self insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as legal  economic and regulatory factors 
our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim 
the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature  timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available 
accordingly  we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability 
this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above 
in doing so  the recorded liability considers future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
we do not discount our estimated losses 
at december   we had an accrual of approximately million for estimated net claims 
in addition  we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums 
at december   we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately million  which represented prefunded claims and premiums 
we are also substantially self insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors  trucks  containers and trailers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under operating lease agreements 
in addition  we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
revenue equipment that is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of our plan to sell certain revenue equipment 
we have not identified any impairment to our remaining assets at december  we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or trade in values for certain new equipment 
we have utilized these trade in values  as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles  in accounting for depreciation expense 
if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for trade in values  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported and as other services are provided 
accordingly  a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
we record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we are the primary obligor  we are a principal in the transaction  we invoice our customers and retain all credit risks and we maintain discretion over pricing 
additionally  we are responsible for carrier selection with respect to our ics business 

table of contents our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments is based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility 
the adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with current accounting standards 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings 
deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery does not meet the more likely than not threshold  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance at december   as all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax related contingencies on our provision for income taxes 
as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes  we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements 
such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments  whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates 
further  a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
see note  income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 
year in review significant events for calendar year include reported seventh consecutive year of record revenues reduced our total debt by approximately million or continued strategy of transitioning our economic model from that of a primarily asset based truckload carrier to an asset light transportation company designated approximately  trailers in our jbt segment to be sold or traded in in connection with our strategy to reduce the jbt segment fleet size to the appropriate level increased our quarterly dividend to per share in january from in  and announced an increase to per share effective february our net earnings of million  or per diluted share  were down from the million  or per diluted share  earned in a slowing freight environment and increased fuel costs were our major challenges for despite decreasing fuel prices in the second half of  compared with the first half  fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during our fuel cost per gallon averaged above levels 
however  due to our fuel surcharge programs  we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs 
freight demand during was up for our jbi and ics segments 
demand for dry van truck capacity was softer  particularly during the fourth quarter our jbi and ics segments grew operating income by and  respectively 
dcs showed a small decline in operating income of 
table of contents while jbt declined from in response to changing market conditions and a continued focus on growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital  we increased our jbi tractor and container counts by and  respectively  as well as increased our dcs trailer count by 
we reduced our jbt company owned tractor fleet by  excluding tractors designated as held for sale 
we were able to effect some of these changes by transferring revenue equipment among our fleets 
our consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was  compared with in our operating income reflected million of pretax charges to write down the value of certain assets held for sale 
operating income in reflected million of pretax charges related to assets held for sale 
results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of percentage change operating revenues between years vs 
vs 
operating revenues operating expenses rents and purchased transportation salaries  wages and employee benefits fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims general and administrative expenses  net of asset dispositions operating taxes and licenses communication and utilities total operating expenses operating income net interest expense equity in loss of affiliated company earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings compared with consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues rose to billion in  a increase over significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of million in  compared with million in this fsc revenue impacted our year to year comparison 
if fsc revenues were excluded from both years  our revenue decreased less than from a and increase in jbi and ics load volume  respectively  contributed to our higher levels of revenue 
the increases in revenue of our jbi and ics segments were partially offset by decreases in our dcs segment as a result of decreased activity for delivery service accounts due to the overall economic slowdown and weak housing market 
our jbt segment revenue decreased as a result of rate declines and reduced tractor utilization  as a result of decreasing freight demand in the jbt segment 

table of contents consolidated operating expenses our total consolidated operating expenses increased over and offset the impact of the increase in revenue over that resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to from in rents and purchased transportation costs rose in  primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads  drayage companies and third party carriers servicing ics 
the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased in from  primarily due to decreases in total driver pay 
this reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment 
fuel and fuel taxes expense increased in  primarily due to higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers 
these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national  regional or local fuel prices 
while these programs may incorporate fuel cost increases as frequently as weekly  most also reflect a specified miles per gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs eg  per gallon to trigger an increase in fuel surcharge revenue 
as a result  some of these programs have a timing lag between when the cost is incurred and when it is recovered 
this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly 
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense  or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads  dray carriers and other third parties 
these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 
while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases  partly due to empty miles run and engine idling time  we are typically able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 
two additional factors related to fuel costs and fuel surcharge revenue primarily impact jbt operating income when fuel costs change rapidly 
some freight services incur empty miles and we may be unable to charge fuel surcharge revenue on those miles 
in addition  most systems and software applications utilized in the truckload industry for measuring miles and billing revenue result in computations that average to fewer miles than what is actually traveled hub miles 
the combination of these two factors frequently results in no fuel surcharge revenue billed for approximately to of the applicable miles actually traveled 
during times of rapidly changing fuel costs  operating income from these services can be significantly impacted 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was due to fewer tractors owned in our jbt and dcs segments 
operating supplies and expenses rose in  primarily as a result of increased costs in airfare and travel expenses 
insurance and claims expense decreased due to fewer accidents and lower claims costs 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in other driving expenses due to a decrease in the number of drivers  and a decrease in the charge to write down to estimated fair value certain assets held for sale compared with the write down 
in addition  gains on asset sales were million in compared with losses on asset sales of million in net interest expense for decreased by compared with this decrease was due to reduced outstanding debt balances as well as reduced interest rates on our variable rate debt 
interest expense was further reduced by a refund of interest previously paid to the internal revenue service irs from the tax case settlement and lower accrued interest on uncertain tax positions 
our effective income tax rate was in and in the increase in was primarily due to the rate being reduced by our tax case settlement in see the section comparing with operating results for further details of this settlement 
we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate for calendar year the equity in loss of affiliated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 

table of contents segments we operated four business segments during calendar year the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment operating revenue by segment years ended december in millions jbi dcs jbt ics subtotal intersegment eliminations total operating income by segment years ended december in millions jbi dcs jbt ics total includes million of pretax charges in and an million pretax charge in to write down the value of certain assets held for sale

the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily the result of a increase in revenue per load  including fuel surcharges  partially offset by a decrease in the average length of haul 
operating income in our jbi segment rose to million in  from million in while increased volumes contributed to higher operating margins  we were able to increase our driver productivity and significantly reduce our reliance on third party equipment and drayage 
all of these factors contributed to our operating income increasing by in 
table of contents dcs segment dcs segment revenue declined to million in  from million in this decrease in revenue was primarily due to an decrease in average length of haul and lower load counts as we worked with our customers to reach the optimum fleet size for their businesses 
operating income decreased to million in  compared with million in this decrease in operating income was due to decreased revenue and higher fuel and operating costs 
these higher operating expenses  relative to  were offset by decreases in equipment rental costs and lower insurance and claim costs 
jbt segment jbt segment revenue declined to million in  from million in the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in load count due to much softer demand in than in operating income in our jbt segment declined to million in  from million in  mainly due to reduced revenue and higher fuel costs 
ics segment ics segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to a increase in load volume from both new and existing customers 
operating income increased nearly to million in  compared with million in the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses  including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment 
in  we continued to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover higher operating expenses 
compared with consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues rose to billion in  a increase over significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of million in  compared with million in this fsc revenue impacted our year to year comparison 
if fsc revenues were excluded from both years  the increase of revenue over was 
this increased level of revenue  excluding fsc  was primarily the result of increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacity management actions and ics business growth 
a and increase in jbi and ics load volume  respectively  contributed to our higher levels of revenue 
the increases in revenue of our jbi  dcs and ics segments were partially offset by decreases in our jbt segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet  rate declines and reduced tractor utilization due to decreasing freight demand in the jbt segment 
consolidated operating expenses our total consolidated operating expenses increased over the combination of the increase in revenue over and this increase in operating expenses resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to from in rents and purchased transportation costs rose in  primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads  drayage companies and third party carriers servicing ics 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in trailing equipment rentals due to our decision to purchase certain trailing equipment off operating leases during the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased less than in from  primarily due to decreases in total driver pay 
this reduction in total driver pay was primarily the result of a decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment 

table of contents fuel and fuel taxes expense increased in  primarily due to higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our purchases of trailing equipment  including new containers and chassis for our jbi segment  as well as trailers purchased off operating leases 
operating supplies and expenses rose in  partly as a result of higher revenue equipment maintenance  including tractors and trailing equipment  as well as increased tire costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the million pretax charge in the fourth quarter to write down the value of certain assets held for sale to fair value  less costs to sell 
this increase was also due to losses on asset sales of million in compared with gains on asset sales of million in our effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in our effective tax rate compared with the prior year rate is primarily the result of our settlement on a proposed irs adjustment  which resulted in a million decrease of income tax expense in the second quarter see note  income taxes  for further information regarding this settlement 
the equity in loss of affiliated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 
jbi segment jbi segment revenue grew by to billion in  from billion in a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a increase in load volume 
the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily the result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue per load due to a decrease in the average length of haul from operating income in our jbi segment rose to million in  from million in while increased volumes contributed to higher operating margins  we were able to reduce the number of empty truck miles in our pickup and delivery operations  increase our driver productivity  and significantly reduce our reliance on third party equipment and drayage 
all of these factors contributed to increasing our operating income by in dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to a increase in revenue per truck per week and slightly higher load counts from customer demand 
operating income decreased to million in  compared with million in the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of an increase in driver compensation  increases in fuel costs  and higher casualty and workers compensation costs in compared with jbt segment jbt segment revenue declined to million in  from million in the decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in load count  due to much softer demand in compared with an approximate decrease in rates also contributed to the decrease in revenue 
operating income in our jbt segment declined to million in  from million in in addition to reduced revenue from lower load volume  operating expenses were higher in  compared with  due to increases in tractor maintenance and tire costs 
also  we recorded an million pretax charge in december to write down the value of certain assets held for sale 

table of contents ics segment ics segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to a increase in load volume from both new and existing customers 
operating income increased nearly to million in  compared with million in the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses  including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment 
in the second half of  we were able to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover higher operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities relative to  after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation  share based compensation and impairment charges  was due primarily to the timing of cash activity related to trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable  as well as tax payments 
cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflected additions to and disposals from our fleet of revenue equipment 
the lower level of cash used in investing activities during partly reflected our strategy of reduced investment in the asset based operations of our jbt segment 
net cash used in financing activities during increased over  primarily due to repayments on our revolving lines of credit in  compared with cash provided by issuance of our senior notes and borrowings on our revolving lines of credit in cash provided by increased borrowings in was primarily used for company stock purchases and capital expenditures 
our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition  earnings  capital requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 
we paid an per share quarterly dividend in  a per share quarterly dividend in and a per share quarterly dividend in in february  we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from to  effective with our payment in february we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
however  no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 
liquidity our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of intermodal trailing equipment  trucks  tractors and dry van trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new  late model equipment 
we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions 
we have  during the past few years  obtained capital through cash generated from operations  revolving lines of credit and long term debt issuances 
we have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 
to date  none of our operating leases contains any residual value guarantees 
at december   we were authorized to borrow up to a total of million under two different revolving lines of credit 
the first line of credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks for a total commitment amount of million  which expires march  the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor  depending upon the specific type of borrowing  plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating 
at december   we had million outstanding at an average interest rate of under this agreement 
our second line of credit is an accounts receivable securitization program with a revolving credit facility up to million 
this facility is secured by our accounts receivable  and we renewed this facility at maturity on july   for a one year term maturing on july  the applicable interest rate under this agreement is the prevailing a p commercial paper rate in the market  plus a margin based 
table of contents on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees 
at december   we had million outstanding at an average interest rate of under this agreement 
in march  we sold million of senior notes notes  which mature march   to various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated march  the proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off operating leases and for general working capital purposes 
the notes were issued at par value 
interest payments are due semiannually  in march and september of each year 
in july  we sold million of senior notes notes  which mature july   to various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated july  proceeds from these notes were used to purchase shares of our common stock  pay down existing debt on our revolving credit facilities and finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment 
principal payments in the amount of million are due july   and july   with the remainder due upon maturity 
interest payments are due semiannually  in january and july of each year 
the note purchase agreements describe the terms and conditions of both notes  which include requirements to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios 
in september  we entered into a million term loan and credit agreement in connection with our purchase of used  dry van trailers 
this million facility is collateralized by a security interest in the trailing equipment and matures september  we are required to make minimum quarterly principal payments in the amount of million  through june   with the remainder due upon maturity 
stated interest on this facility is a three month libor variable rate 
concurrent with the loan and credit agreement  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert this floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis of 
the swap expires september   when the related term loan is due 
at december   we had million outstanding under this term loan facility 
our revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december  we believe that our liquid assets  cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock 
we are currently committed to spend approximately million  net of proceeds from sales or trade ins during  which is primarily related to tractors and containers 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and facilities 
as of december   we had less than  of obligations on the trailing equipment leases and approximately million on the facilities leases 
contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands amounts due in calendar year total and thereafter operating leases long term debt obligations commitments to acquire revenue equipment and facilities total 
table of contents we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately million at december   that expire at various dates in fiscal year  which are related to our self insured retention levels for casualty and workers compensation claims  and our operating lease agreements 
we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our third party agreements 
the table above excludes million of liabilities under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

in october  the fasb issued staff position fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  fsp 
fsp clarifies the application of fas in cases where a market is not active 
we have considered the guidance provided by fsp in our determination of estimated fair values as of december   and the impact was not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of our total million of debt  we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   under our revolving lines of credit 
the interest rates applicable to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or libor 
our earnings would be affected by changes in these short term interest rates 
risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near term adverse increase in short term interest rates 
at our current level of borrowing  a increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately million 
our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate debt  and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense 
periodically  we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
