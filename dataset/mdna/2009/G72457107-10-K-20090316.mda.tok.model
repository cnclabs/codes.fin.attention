recent accounting pronouncements business introduction primus guaranty  ltd 
is a holding company that conducts business currently through two principal operating subsidiaries  primus financial  a cdpc  and primus asset management  an investment manager to affiliated companies and third party entities 
primus financial primus financial was established to sell credit swaps primarily to global financial institutions and major credit swap dealers  referred to as counterparties  against primarily investment grade credit obligations of corporate and sovereign issuers 
primus financial currently has a a credit watch negative counterparty rating by s p 
in exchange for a fixed quarterly premium  primus financial agreed  upon the occurrence of a default or other defined credit event eg  bankruptcy  failure to pay or restructuring affecting a designated issuer  referred to as a reference entity  to pay its counterparty an agreed upon notional amount against delivery to primus financial of the reference entity s debt obligation in the same notional amount 
primus financial may then elect to sell or hold the security presented by the counterparty 
alternatively  primus financial has the ability to cash settle counterparty claims through industry sponsored cash settlement protocols 
credit swaps related to a single specified reference entity are referred to as single name credit swaps 

table of contents primus financial has sold credit swaps referencing portfolios containing obligations of multiple reference entities  which are referred to as tranches 
additionally  primus financial has sold credit swaps on asset backed securities  which are referred to as cds on abs 
these asset backed securities are referenced to residential mortgage backed securities 
defined credit events related to cds on abs may include any or all of the following failure to pay principal  write down in the reference obligation and ratings downgrades to ccc caa s p moody s or below of the reference obligation 
at december   primus financial s credit swap portfolio had a total notional amount of billion  which included billion of single name credit swaps  billion of tranches and million of cds on abs 
primus asset management primus asset management acts as an investment manager to affiliated companies and third party entities 
it currently manages the credit swap and cash investment portfolios of its affiliate  primus financial 
primus asset management also manages two clos 
clos issue securities backed by a diversified pool of primarily below investment grade rated senior secured loans of corporations 
additionally  primus asset management manages three investment grade csos on behalf of third parties 
csos issue securities backed by one or more credit swaps sold against a diversified pool of investment grade corporate or sovereign reference entities 
primus asset management receives fees for its investment management services to the five investment vehicles 
in general  such management fees are calculated based on percentage of assets under management  subject to applicable contractual terms 
as of december   clo and cso assets under management were approximately billion 
primus asset management has entered into a services agreement with its affiliates  whereby it provides services to its affiliates  including management  consulting and information technology 
prs trading harrier prs trading strategies  llc prs trading commenced operations in january to trade in a broad range of fixed income products  including credit default swaps  investment grade and high yield bonds  as well as leveraged loans 
in april  primus guaranty formed harrier credit strategies master fund  lp harrier 
during the second quarter of  primus guaranty transferred the trading portfolio of its subsidiary  prs trading to harrier 
harrier traded in an expanded range of fixed income products  including credit swaps  total return swaps on loan transactions  cds indices  leveraged loans and investment grade and non investment grade securities 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to discontinue harrier  due in part to harrier s performance and difficulty in raising third party capital  given the market environment at that time 
at december   prs trading was inactive  therefore  comparisons from the prior year are not meaningful 
as of march   harrier ceased trading activities and closed all of its remaining trading positions 
executive overview was a very challenging and volatile period for the global financial and credit markets 
credit market conditions worsened considerably over the course of the year 
credit spreads widened significantly as a result of a broad based repricing of credit risk 
credit markets were essentially frozen with very little trading volume and wide and volatile price swings 
the rating agencies also continued to take actions with downgrades across a broad cross section of industries particularly as the impact of the economic downturn  lack of market liquidity and deterioration in corporate balance sheets took effect 
these rating downgrades also included various structured credit vehicles including cdos  clos and cdpcs 
there were a number of business failures during the year which resulted in credit events within the credit swap market 
many highly rated financial institutions came under significant pressure as a result of underperforming assets  leverage and lack of market liquidity 
among reference entities in primus financial s credit swap portfolio  fannie mae and freddie mac were placed into conservatorship  kaupthing bank hf 
of iceland was placed into receivership  lehman brothers holdings inc declared bankruptcy and washington mutual was taken over by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
additionally  governments and central banks orchestrated a number of bank mergers and announced broad based bailouts and took equity stakes in many major financial institutions to avert a collapse of the financial system 

table of contents primus financial we were not insulated from these unprecedented market conditions and experienced a very challenging year 
primus financial was affected by these circumstances in a number of ways  including counterparties ceased to purchase new credit swap protection from primus financial after the first quarter of as a result  primus financial has changed its strategy from a growth model to an amortization model 
under the amortization model  primus financial s existing credit swap contracts will expire at maturity unless terminated early and it is not expected that new credit swap contracts will be added to the portfolio  primus financial s ratings were downgraded by s p and moody s  principally as a result of two factors a realized losses from credit events on reference entities within primus financial s credit swap portfolio  which reduced its available capital  and b credit rating downgrades on a number of reference entities within primus financial s credit swap portfolio  and on february   moody s announced that it has withdrawn primus financial s counterparty rating and debt ratings of primus financial  at the request of primus financial 
counterparty capacity primus financial began the year with a strong first quarter as it sold billion of new credit swap protection 
however  the collapse of the bear stearns companies  inc in mid march caused counterparties to shut down credit lines and primus financial witnessed a sharp reduction in counterparties willing to transact with it 
primus financial was only able to write minimal amounts of new credit swap business in the subsequent quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  management concluded that it was unlikely primus financial could write any new credit swaps for the foreseeable future as a result of the lack of counterparty capacity 
this environment necessitated a change in primus financial s business strategy to an amortization model 
credit events primus financial recorded net realized losses on credit events of during during september and october of  we saw significant deterioration in the financial sector  which resulted in five credit events  which directly impacted primus financial 
these credit events on single name reference entities resulted in net realized losses of million during the third and fourth quarters of approximately  or million  related to lehman brothers holdings inc and kaupthing bank hf 
these credit events also reduced primus financial s total notional credit swap portfolio by million 
in addition to these realized losses on single name reference entities  primus financial also incurred million in losses related to its cds on abs portfolio 
credit events are further discussed under net credit swap loss below in more detail 
credit ratings at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth quarter of  reference entity credit rating downgrades and credit events that primus financial experienced in its credit swap portfolio led to downgrades of primus financial s counterparty aaa aaa ratings to a a s p moody s as of december  
as we have previously disclosed  these downgrades do not trigger a credit event  or require collateral postings  or allow a counterparty to terminate its credit swap transactions with primus financial 
following the initial downgrade of primus financial s counterparty ratings  we conducted a review of the credit swap business and determined not to raise any additional capital or inject capital from primus guaranty to support the primus financial credit swap business 

table of contents primus asset management as a result of the adverse market conditions  primus asset management was not able to originate any new investment management or advisory assignments during generally  structured credit investors were unwilling to commit new capital given the volatility and continued turmoil in the credit markets 
our three managed csos and two managed clos experienced deterioration in the credit quality of their portfolios as a result of negative migration and credit events affecting certain reference entities underlying the portfolios 
trends and business outlook general economic conditions have continued to deteriorate and we are now in the midst of a global recession 
these conditions likely will cause further deterioration in corporate balance sheets  ratings downgrades and additional business failures  resulting in continued disruptions in the credit markets 
in response  g governments have implemented various programs seeking to stimulate their economies and to improve confidence in the financial and industrial sectors 
these programs have included injecting capital directly into major banks  arranging mergers of weak banks and institutions with stronger entities and assisting in various business combinations between financial institutions 
additionally  governments have established programs to assist certain key industries  including the automobile industry among others 
the us government has announced a stimulus program under which it will spend billions of dollars intending to stabilize the housing market and seeking to create new jobs within the economy 
other g governments are considering similar programs 
it is difficult to predict whether these various stimulus programs and bank related bailouts will have an ameliorative effect on the severe global economic downturn 
we expect to continue to experience throughout high levels of equity and credit market volatility  dysfunctional capital markets with investors remaining reluctant to commit capital  and volatile currency  commodity and securities markets 
these conditions will continue until the global economic situation stabilizes and the global economy starts to grow 
in and afterwards  should these conditions persist  primus financial may experience a higher level of credit events which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are also continuing to experience very difficult conditions in the global financial and credit markets 
these conditions are characterized by greater volatility  less liquidity  wide credit spreads  a lack of price transparency and a flight to quality  among others 
major credit swap dealers and global banks in reaction to this worsening credit environment and in response to their own capital issues  have significantly tightened criteria for acceptable counterparties 
in almost every case  counterparties are now required to post collateral to transact in the credit swap market 
it is our expectation  that credit spreads will continue to remain wide and volatile  and there will be a general lack of liquidity 
we will continue to face a very challenging for business environment during which is likely to result in increased defaults in and additional write downs of credit assets  further consolidation of major banks and credit swap dealers  increased credit default swap market regulations  and one or more credit default swap clearinghouses 
despite the current uncertainties and turmoil in the credit swap market  we believe that credit will remain a large asset class 
we believe that credit swap activity will continue to be robust in and credit swap trading volumes will likely remain high  albeit at levels below their peak in at the same time  though  we will probably see a return to simplicity in terms of credit swap structures and business models with less leverage 
we also expect that many market participants will narrow and sharpen their strategic focus 
this means that there is likely to be more consolidation in the credit markets beyond the financial services industries 
as a result  we believe there may be attractive structured credit asset management acquisition opportunities 
in addition  we have decided that we do not need to maintain two independent ratings and plan to maintain ratings with only s p 

table of contents given the rapidly changing market environment  our management team  in consultation with our board  has carefully reviewed our strengths  weaknesses  opportunities and challenges in order to fashion a business plan that focuses on optimizing value to shareholders 
our business priorities and initiatives will include the following amortizing primus financial s credit swap portfolio  pursuing new opportunities in credit  structured credit and derivative markets  and aligning costs with our business approach 
under the amortization model  primus financial s existing credit swap contracts will expire at maturity unless terminated early and it is not expected that new credit swap contracts will be added to the portfolio 
the amortization has already started  as primus financial has been unable to write any meaningful new credit swap business since the first quarter of the average remaining maturity of primus financial s credit swap portfolio was years at year end compared with years at the end of approximately  billion notional amount of primus financial s credit swap contracts is scheduled to mature in  and an additional billion is scheduled to mature in management s focus in amortizing primus financial s portfolio will be to seek to maximize the potential value within primus financial 
we are continuing to pursue opportunities to grow our assets under management 
specifically  we see opportunities to acquire companies  asset management contracts and structured credit assets arising from the consolidation which is likely to take place during within the structured credit markets 
additionally  we are considering various alternatives for establishing a new credit protection business 
if we are successful in establishing this new platform it will likely be a company that posts collateral 
if appropriate  we may invest some of our capital in these new initiatives 
we have been successful in reducing our operating expenses from their peak in steps management has taken include staff reductions and lowering our compensation and non compensation expenses 
management continues to be aware of the need to achieve an appropriate balance of cost containment against the need to properly support our current and prospective business initiatives 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and those differences may be material 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that require management to make significant judgments and involve a higher degree of complexity 
we have identified the valuation of derivative financial instruments and investments as critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereon included elsewhere in this annual report 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows valuation of financial instruments a significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or loss each period 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

under this standard  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
in determining fair value  we use various valuation techniques 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 

table of contents the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation techniques using unobservable inputs level 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances 
these valuations techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment 
the degree to which management s estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market price transparency for the instruments  the availability of observable inputs  frequency of trading in the instruments and the instrument s complexity 
in measuring the fair market values of our financial instruments  we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas no 
the hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
cash and cash equivalents  which include deposits in banks and money market accounts  are categorized within level we do not adjust the quoted prices for such financial instruments 
level valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active  or valuations for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data  either directly or indirectly 
us government agency obligations  commercial paper  corporate debt securities and interest rate swap are categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the interest rate swap is included in other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
level valuations based on significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
primus financial s fair value of its credit swap portfolio is categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy  which includes single name  tranches and cds on abs 
the single name credit swap portfolio classification in level is primarily the result of the estimation of nonperformance risk 
in addition  clo investments and abs are categorized within level 
table of contents nonperformance risk adjustment as required under sfas no 
 the company considers the effect of its nonperformance risk in determining the fair value of its liabilities 
upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  the company has incorporated a nonperformance risk adjustment in the computation of the fair value of primus financial s credit swap portfolio 
the developing industry standard for calculating this adjustment is to incorporate the entity s own credit spread into the computation of the mark to market 
primus derives an estimate of primus financial s credit spread because it does not have an actively quoted credit spread 
this estimated credit spread was obtained by reference to similar other entities that have quoted spreads 
the majority of the comparative entities are engaged in the financial insurance business 
the consideration of primus financial s nonperformance risk resulted in an adjustment of billion during the year ended december   which reduced the fair value of primus financial s credit swap liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition and reduced net credit swap loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
level assets and liabilities level assets  which include trading account assets and our two clo investments  were million  or of total assets measured at fair value  at december  level liabilities  which include primus financial s credit swaps sold  were billion  or of total liabilities measured at fair value  at december  primus financial s credit swap valuation techniques are described below 
see note financial instruments and fair value disclosures of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following fair value hierarchy table presents information about our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  in thousands quoted prices in significant active markets other significant assets for observable unobservable liabilities identical assets inputs inputs at fair level level level value total assets percentage of total assets measured at fair value total liabilities percentage of total liabilities measured at fair value valuation techniques credit swaps primus financial s fair value of its portfolio of single name  tranche and cds on abs credit swaps  depends upon a number of factors  including the contractual terms of the swap contract  which include the reference entity  the notional value  the maturity  the credit swap premium and the currency of the swap 
current market data  including credit swap premium levels pertinent to each reference entity  estimated recovery rates on reference entities  market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  an estimate of mid market prices to exit prices  and for tranche transactions  estimates of the correlation of the underlying reference entities within each tranche transaction 

table of contents valuation models  which are used to derive a fair value of credit swaps 
the valuation models have been internally developed but are benchmarked against market standard models 
consideration of the credit risk of primus financial s counterparties  as well as its own nonperformance risk 
sfas no 
requires that nonperformance risk be considered when determining the fair value of primus financial s credit swaps 
fair value estimates of credit swaps from third party valuation services and or credit swap counterparties 
in general  the most significant component of the credit swap valuation is the difference between the contractual credit swap premium on the credit swaps primus financial has transacted and the comparable current market premium 
the valuation process we use to obtain fair value is described below for single name credit swaps  the valuation model uses mid market credit swap premium data obtained from an independent pricing service 
the inputs to the valuation model include current credit swap premium quotes obtained from an independent pricing service on the reference entities  estimated recovery rates on reference entities  current interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the independent pricing service obtains mid market credit swap premium quotes from a number of dealers in the credit swap market across a range of standard maturities and restructuring terms  and computes average credit swap premium quotes on specific reference entities 
primus financial adjusts the independent mid market credit swap premium quotes to derive estimated exit price valuations 
for tranche credit swaps  primus financial calculates a mid market valuation for each tranche transaction using a tranche valuation model 
the inputs to the tranche valuation model include current credit swap premium quotes obtained from an independent pricing service on the reference entities within the tranche  estimated recovery rates on the reference entities within the tranche  current interest rates market and correlation levels derived from credit swap indices 
primus financial adjusts the mid market valuations obtained from the model to estimated exit price valuations  using mid market to exit price quotes obtained from tranche counterparties 
for cds on abs  primus financial obtains expected cash flows on the underlying securities from an independent valuation service and quotes from primus financial s counterparties 
primus financial uses the cash flow data as input to a cds on abs valuation model to obtain mid market valuations 
primus financial adjusts the mid market valuations to obtain exit price valuations 

table of contents valuation techniques other financial instruments we use the following valuation techniques to determine the fair value of our other financial instruments for cash and cash equivalents  which include deposits in banks and money market accounts  the fair value of these instruments is based upon quoted market prices 
we do not adjust the quoted price for such instruments 
for us government agency obligations  commercial paper and corporate debt securities  the fair value is based upon observable quoted market prices and benchmarked to third party quotes 
for the interest rate swap  the fair value is based upon observable market data including contractual terms  market prices and interest rates and is benchmarked to a third party quote 
for the abs  the fair value is based upon a valuation from an independent valuation service  which estimates the value of the bond by utilizing a valuation model 
this model incorporates projected cash flows  utilizing default  prepayment  recovery and interest rate assumptions 
for the two clo investments  the fair value is based upon a valuation model which includes observable inputs  where available 
the model calculates the present value of expected cash flows using estimates of key portfolio assumptions  including forecasted credit losses  prepayment rates  forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risk involved 
the valuations are benchmarked to third party quotes 
share based employee compensation plans we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including share options and other forms of equity compensation based on estimated fair values 
compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of options  performance shares  restricted shares and share units  as determined on the date of grant and is being expensed over the related vesting period 
the fair value of the options granted is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we continue to apply the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for share awards as we deem it to be the most appropriate model 
the use of the black scholes option pricing model requires certain estimates for values of variables used in the model 
results of operations introduction the primary component of our financial results is net credit swap revenue loss 
net credit swap revenue loss incorporates credit swap premium income  together with realized gains and losses arising from the termination of credit swaps  as a result of credit events or credit mitigation decisions 
in addition  changes in the unrealized gains losses fair value of credit swap portfolio are included in net credit swap revenue loss 
other sources of revenue consist of interest income earned on our investments and fees earned from our asset management activities 

table of contents expenses include interest expense on the debt issued by primus guaranty and primus financial  employee compensation and other expenses 
primus financial also makes distributions on its preferred securities 
these components are discussed in more detail below 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview of financial results our gaap net loss for was billion  compared with a gaap net loss of million for our gaap net losses were primarily driven by net credit swap losses of billion and million for and  respectively

the components of our net credit swap losses for primus financial are discussed in greater detail below 
interest income on our portfolio of investments was million in  compared with million in the decrease is primarily attributable to lower market interest rates in  partially offset by higher average invested balances during the period 
the turmoil in the debt capital markets that began in august continued during as a result  primus financial s perpetual preferred securities and subordinated deferrable interest notes were set at the contractually specified rates over london interbank offered rate libor 
these specified rates are subject to increase if the credit ratings on these securities are downgraded 
during  as a result of downgrades on these securities  the spread rates have increased to the maximum rates specified in the respective security agreements 
interest expense and distributions on perpetual preferred securities issued by primus financial were million in  compared with million in the decrease is primarily attributable to lower libor  partially offset by the increase in the specified spread rates on primus financial s preferred securities and debt 
our operating expenses were million in  compared with million in excluding restructuring costs incurred in 
the decrease in operating expenses was principally a result of a reduction in the employee incentive bonus accrual and other cost cutting initiatives which we put in place during the largest component of our operating expenses is employee compensation  which includes salaries  benefits  accrual for incentive bonuses and share compensation 
incentive bonuses and share compensation awards are significantly influenced by our financial performance

realized gains incurred during the years ended december  and were primarily the result of rebalancing primus financial s credit swap portfolio 
the realized losses on credit events incurred during the year ended december  were primarily the result of credit events  which occurred during the third quarter of and are discussed below under credit events 
other realized losses incurred during the year ended december  were primarily the result of primus financial s decision to reduce its exposure to a limited number of reference entities against which it had sold credit protection 

table of contents credit events during the year ended december   primus financial recorded net realized losses of million related to credit events on its single name credit swaps sold and cds on abs  as discussed below 
credit swaps sold single name during the year ended december   credit events on five reference entities occurred in primus financial s credit swap portfolio with a total notional amount of million 
as a result  we recorded realized losses of million  net of recovery values  related to these credit events in the consolidated results of operations 
primus financial primarily settled these credit events by means of cash payments equivalent to the net realized losses on credit events in the table below 
the cash settlement amounts were determined under the cash settlement protocol established for each reference entity 
primus financial elected to take kaupthing bank hf securities in settlement of the credit event on that reference entity 
the net realized loss on credit event for kaupthing bank hf represents the difference between the payment to the counterparty and the fair value of kaupthing bank hf securities received from the counterparty

these asset backed securities are referenced to residential mortgage backed securities 
defined credit events related to cds on abs may include any or all of the following failure to pay principal  write down in the reference obligation and downgrades to ccc caa s p moody s or below of the reference obligation 
upon the occurrence of a defined credit event  a counterparty has the right to present the underlying abs  in whole or part  to primus financial  in exchange for a cash payment by primus financial  up to the notional amount of the credit swap physical settlement 
if there is a principal write down of the abs  a counterparty may claim for cash compensation for the amount of the principal write down  up to the notional value of the credit swap without presentation of the abs 
during the year ended december   primus financial recorded realized losses of million  net of bond recovery values  related to physical settlement with counterparties and principal write down claims on its cds on abs portfolio 
primus financial reduced its cds on abs portfolio by million of total notional amounts for these positions 

table of contents primus financial will no longer receive swap premiums from the counterparties for the swaps  or the portions thereof  that were terminated as a result of the physical settlement or principal write down claims 
as the owner of the abs  primus financial is entitled to receive payments of principal and interest thereon 
at december   the fair value of the abs delivered as a result of physical settlements by counterparties was not material 
at december   primus financial s cds on abs portfolio was million in notional amount 
the notional principal amount and the unrealized loss on the cds on abs  which had been downgraded to ccc s p  were million and million  respectively 
of these cds on abs  million in notional amount was written with lbsf  a defaulting counterparty  which is no longer paying premiums 
primus financial continues to earn and collect premiums on the remaining million in notional amount cds on abs which had been downgraded to ccc s p 
counterparty default lehman brothers special financing inc primus financial has entered into credit swap transactions with lehman brothers special financing inc lbsf  pursuant to an isda master agreement 
at the time of these transactions  lbsf was an indirect subsidiary of lehman brothers holdings inc lbh  and lbh was the credit support provider under these transactions 
during and subsequent to the end of the third quarter of  lbsf suffered a number of events of default under the isda master agreement  including bankruptcy  failure to pay premiums when due and bankruptcy of its credit support provider 
primus financial has not designated any early termination date under the isda master agreement  and accordingly  intends to continue the credit swap agreements 
in our opinion  because the defaults of lbh and lbsf are not subject to cure  as a legal matter  primus financial is not obligated to settle with lbsf with respect to any existing or future credit events 
however  under relevant accounting standards  primus financial will continue to carry these credit swaps at their fair value 
lbsf was obligated to pay approximately million in premiums on its credit swap transactions during the third and fourth quarters of  but failed to do so

 which is reflected in the december  balance 
primus financial continued to experience a significant and ongoing widening of market credit swap premium levels as a result of the substantial re pricing of credit risk  which led to the unrealized losses on the credit swap portfolio during the years ended december  and asset management and advisory fees we earned million and million of asset management and advisory fees for the years ended december  and  respectively

incentive bonus awards are significantly impacted by our financial performance 
compensation expense for the year ended december  decreased by approximately million from overall  the decrease was primarily the result of a lower accrual for performance based incentive awards  based on our financial results  and reductions in headcount

share compensation expense was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
professional and legal fees expense includes audit and tax advisor fees  legal costs  consulting fees  recruitment fees and director and officer insurance expense 
the decrease in professional and legal fees was primarily attributable to lower legal  consulting fees and employee recruiting costs 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily as a result of the write off of certain software and technology assets in connection with harrier s discontinuation during the fourth quarter of the decrease in technology and data expense was primarily attributable to reduced technology services 
other operating expenses include rent  bank fees  ratings agency fees  brokerage expense  travel and entertainment  exchange fees and other administrative expenses 
the decrease in other expenses was primarily a result of cost cutting initiatives 
interest expense and preferred distributions the turmoil in the debt capital markets that began in august continued during as a result  primus financial s perpetual preferred securities and subordinated deferrable interest notes were set at the contractually specified rates over london interbank offered rate libor

during  as a result of downgrades on these securities  the spread rates have increased to the maximum rates specified in the respective security agreements 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million of interest expense  respectively 
interest expense decreased primarily as a result of lower libor applicable during  compared with  although the reduction was partly offset by the increase in the specified spread rates on primus financial s debt 
interest expense includes the interest expense on our senior notes and the associated interest rate swap 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution that effectively converted a notional amount of million of our senior notes  to floating rate debt based on three month libor plus a fixed spread of 
the decline in libor during the year of had the effect of reducing the net interest expense on these notes 
the average interest rate on our debt was and for the years ended december  and  respectively

it is expected that only the income of primus asset management and its subsidiary  primus re  are likely to be subject to us federal and local income taxes 
however  were primus bermuda to be subject to income tax  at a combined us federal  new york state and new york city income tax rate of  on its gaap income or loss  then its income tax benefit  excluding interest and penalties  would have been approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the credit spread widening presented opportunities for a significant increase in our transaction volume in our credit protection business 
during  primus financial grew its credit swap portfolio by billion to billion from billion 
this was the highest new transaction volume in any year of our history 
the significant widening in credit spreads had a negative impact on our gaap results for the year ended december   primarily resulting from significant unrealized losses from the mark to market losses of the credit swap portfolio

non gaap financial measures economic results in addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with gaap  our management and our board of directors use certain non gaap financial measures called economic results 
we believe that our economic results provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance and business trends 
economic results is an accrual based measure of our financial performance  which in our view  better reflects our long term buy and hold strategy in our credit protection business 
however  economic results is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under gaap  therefore  these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for gaap 
we define economic results as gaap net income loss adjusted for the following unrealized gains losses on credit swaps sold by primus financial are excluded from gaap net income loss  realized gains from early termination of credit swaps sold by primus financial are excluded from gaap net income loss  realized gains from early termination of credit swaps sold by primus financial are amortized over the period that would have been the remaining life of the credit swap  and that amortization is added to gaap net income loss  and provision for credit events 
commencing with the third quarter of  we make provisions for credit events only in the period in which the event occurs  a change from our previous practice 
we exclude unrealized gains losses on credit swaps sold because quarterly changes in the fair value of the credit swap portfolio do not necessarily cause primus financial to take any specific actions relative to any reference entity or group of reference entities 
we manage the primus financial portfolio based on our assessment of credit fundamentals with a general strategy of holding credit swaps to maturity 
at maturity  the mark to market values would revert to zero  to the extent no realized gains or losses had occurred 
additionally  changes in the fair value of the credit swap portfolio have no impact on our liquidity  as primus financial does not provide counterparties with collateral  nor its credit ratings  as the capital models do not consider changes in fair value a determinant of capital sufficiency 
we exclude realized gains on credit swaps sold because our strategy is focused on generation of premium income as opposed to trading gains and losses  although we amortize these realized gains over the original remaining life of the terminated contracts 
losses arising from credit events other than one instance mentioned below are recognized by us as realized events in the period in which the event occurs for gaap reporting and economic results purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we created a provision of million in our economic results for credit events that occurred in january with respect to six credit swap transactions in the portfolio related to cds on abs 
during the first quarter of  one counterparty delivered to primus financial an abs with a million face amount and primus financial paid million to the counterparty 
that swap was terminated as a result of the physical settlement and primus financial will no longer receive credit swap premiums from the counterparty 
as the owner of the abs  primus financial is entitled to receive payments of principal and interest thereon 
based on the value of the delivered bond at its delivery date  we increased the provision by an additional thousand in the first quarter of as previously stated in the third quarter of  provisions for credit events are recognized in economic results in the period the event occurs 

table of contents the following table below presents a reconciliation of our economic results non gaap measures to gaap years ended december  gaap net income loss adjustments less change in unrealized fair value of credit swaps sold gain loss by primus financial less realized gains from early termination of credit swaps sold by primus financial add amortization of realized gains from the early termination of credit swaps sold by primus financial less provision for credit events add deduction against provision for credit events net economic results economic earnings per diluted share economic weighted average common shares outstanding diluted economic results earnings per diluted share is calculated by dividing net economic results by the weighted average number of common shares adjusted for the potential issuance of common shares dilutive securities

accordingly  the clo investments are classified as available for sale investments 
available for sale investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
we make an assessment to determine whether unrealized losses reflect declines in value of securities that are other than temporarily impaired 
we consider many factors  including the length of time and significance of the decline in fair value  our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for a recovery in fair value  recent events specific to the issuer or industry  credit ratings and asset quality of collateral structure  and any significant changes in estimated cash flows 
if  based on our evaluation of these factors  we determine that the impairment is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is written down to fair value and the unrealized loss is recognized through a charge to earnings in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the end of the fourth quarter of  the credit markets experienced significant deterioration and a higher level of risk relating to structured investment vehicles 
as a result of our review of the underlying collateral of our clo investments  our level of subordination  the market s perception of risk and estimated future cash flows in the clos  we determined that there was a permanent decline in fair value 
based on our evaluation during the end of the fourth quarter of  we considered our clo investments to be impaired at december  as a result  we recorded an impairment loss on our clo investments of million in our consolidated statements of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for gains or losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a consequence of changes in market conditions 
our primary market risk is changes in market credit swap premium levels  which increase or decrease the fair value of the credit swap portfolio 
market credit swap premium levels change as a result of specific events or news related to a reference entity  such as a change in a credit rating by any of the rating agencies 
additionally  market credit swap premium levels can vary as a result of changes in market sentiment 
as a general matter  given primus financial s strategy of holding credit swaps sold until maturity  we do not seek to manage our overall exposure to market credit swap premium levels  and we expect fluctuations in the fair value of the credit swap portfolio as a result of these changes 
as of december   each ten basis point increase or decrease in market credit swap premiums would decrease or increase the fair value of the credit swap portfolio by approximately million 
we face other market risks  which are likely to have a lesser impact upon our net income than those associated with market credit swap premium level risk 
these other risks include interest rate risk associated with market interest rate movements 
these movements may affect the value of the credit swap portfolio as our pricing model includes an interest rate component  which is used to discount future expected cash flows 
interest rate movements may also affect the carrying value of and yield on our investments 
the primus financial perpetual preferred shares pays distributions that are based upon the auction rate preferred market 
a difference between the rates we pay in the auction rate preferred market and the interest rates we receive on our investments may result in an additional cost to our company 
assuming that auction results with respect to the primus financial perpetual preferred shares reflect prevailing short term interest rates  each basis point increase or decrease in the level of those rates would increase or decrease primus financial s annual distribution cost by approximately  for its perpetual preferred securities 
in addition  interest rate movements may increase or decrease the interest expense we incur on our million of subordinated deferrable interest notes 
a basis point increase in the level of those rates would increase primus financial s interest expense by  annually 
in february  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution that effectively converted a notional amount of million of our senior notes  to floating rate debt based on three month libor plus a fixed spread of 
assuming a basis point increase or decrease in three month libor  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  annually
