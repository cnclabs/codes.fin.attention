item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for  the negative development relates to an increase in the company s prior accident years loss estimates for personal automobile insurance in florida and new jersey 
in addition  an increase in estimates for loss severity for the accident year reserves for california and new jersey automobile lines of business contributed to the deficiencies 
for  loss redundancies largely relate to lower inflation than originally expected on the bodily injury coverage reserves for the california automobile insurance lines of business 
in addition  the company experienced a reduction in expenditures to outside legal counsel for the defense of personal automobile claims in california 
this led to a reduction in the ultimate expense amount expected to be paid out and therefore a redundancy in the reserves established at december  partially offsetting these loss redundancies was adverse development in the florida and new jersey automobile lines of business 
for years through  the company s previously estimated loss reserves produced deficiencies which were reflected in the subsequent years incurred losses 
the company attributes a large portion of the deficiencies to increases in the ultimate liability for bodily injury  physical damage and collision claims over what was originally estimated 
the increases in these losses relate to increased severity over what was originally recorded and are the result of inflationary trends in health care costs  auto parts and body shop labor costs 
operating ratios loss and expense ratios loss and underwriting expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies 
under sap  losses and loss adjustment expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums earned because losses occur over the life of a policy 
underwriting expenses on a statutory basis are stated as a percentage of premiums written rather than premiums earned because most underwriting expenses are incurred when policies are written and are not spread over the policy period 
the statutory underwriting profit margin is the extent to which the combined loss and underwriting expense ratios are less than 
the insurance companies loss ratio  expense ratio and combined ratio  and the private passenger automobile industry combined ratio  on a statutory basis  are shown in the following table 
the insurance companies ratios include lines of insurance other than private passenger automobile 
since these other lines represent only of premiums written  the company believes its ratios can be compared to the industry ratios included in the following table 
year ended december  loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio industry combined ratio all writers industry combined ratio excluding direct writers n a source am best  aggregates averages through  for all property and casualty insurance companies private passenger automobile line only  after policyholder dividends 
source am best  special report am property causality review preview  february  n a not available 
under gaap  the loss ratio is computed in the same manner as under statutory accounting  but the expense ratio is determined by matching underwriting expenses to the period over which net premiums were earned  rather than to the period that net premiums were written 
the following table sets forth the insurance companies loss ratio  expense ratio and combined ratio determined in accordance with gaap for the last five years 
year ended december  loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio premiums to surplus ratio the following table reflects  for the periods indicated  the insurance companies statutory ratios of net premiums written to policyholders surplus 
widely recognized guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners naic indicate that this ratio should be no greater than to year ended december  amounts in thousands  except ratios net premiums written policyholders surplus ratio to to to to to risk based capital the naic employs a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies that establishes recommended minimum capital requirements for casualty companies 
the formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
based on the formula adopted by the naic  the company has calculated the risk based capital requirements of each of the insurance companies as of december  as of such date  each of the insurance companies policyholders surplus exceeded the highest level of minimum required capital 
statutory accounting principles the company s results are reported in accordance with gaap  which differ from amounts reported in accordance with sap as prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities 
specifically  under gaap policy acquisition costs such as commissions  premium taxes and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned  rather than expensed as incurred  as required by sap 
certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets whereas  under sap  such assets are designated as nonadmitted assets  and charged directly against statutory surplus 
these assets consist primarily of premium receivables outstanding more than days  federal deferred tax assets in excess of statutory limitations  state deferred taxes  furniture  equipment  leasehold improvements  capitalized software  and prepaid expenses 
amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverables  rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  respectively  as required by sap 
fixed maturities securities are reported at fair value  rather than at amortized cost  or the lower of amortized cost or fair value  depending on the specific type of security  as required by sap 
the differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense 
changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense  rather than recorded directly to statutory surplus as regards policyholders  as required by sap 
admittance testing under sap may result in a charge to unassigned surplus for non admitted portions of deferred tax assets 
under gaap  a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets and reflected as an expense 
certain assessments paid to regulatory agencies that are recoverable from policy holders in future periods are expensed whereas these amounts are recorded as receivables under sap 
investments and investment results general the company s investments are directed by the company s chief investment officer under the supervision of the company s board of directors 
the company follows an investment policy that is regularly reviewed and revised 
the company s policy emphasizes investment grade  fixed income securities and maximization of after tax yields and places certain restrictions to limit portfolio concentrations and market exposure 
sales of securities are undertaken  with resulting gains or losses  in order to enhance after tax yield and keep the portfolio in line with current market conditions 
tax considerations  including the impact of the alternative minimum tax amt  are important in portfolio management 
changes in loss experience  growth rates and profitability produce significant changes in the company s exposure to amt liability  requiring appropriate shifts in the investment asset mix between taxable bonds  tax exempt bonds and equities in order to maximize after tax yield 
the company closely monitors the timing and recognition of capital gains and losses to maximize the realization of any deferred tax assets arising from capital losses 
at december   the company had available tax gains carried forward of approximately million 
investment portfolio the following table sets forth the composition of the company s investment portfolio december  amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value amounts in thousands taxable bonds tax exempt state and municipal bonds redeemable fund preferred stocks total fixed maturities equity investments including non redeemable preferred stocks short term investments total investments the company continually evaluates the recoverability of its investment holdings

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 when a decline in value of fixed maturities or equity securities was considered other than temporary  the company wrote the security down to fair value by recognizing a loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
declines in value considered to be temporary were charged as unrealized losses to shareholders equity as a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   approximately of the company s total investment portfolio at fair value and of its total fixed maturity investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt municipal bonds 
shorter duration sinking fund preferred stocks and collateralized mortgage obligations together represented of the company s total investment portfolio at fair value 
the weighted average standard poor s  moody s and fitch s rating of the company s bond holdings was aa at december  holdings of lower than investment grade bonds and non rated bonds constituted approximately and  respectively  of total invested assets at fair value 
the nominal average maturity of the overall bond portfolio  including collateralized mortgage obligations and short term investments  was years at december   which reflects a portfolio heavily weighted in investment grade tax exempt municipal bonds 
the call adjusted average maturity of the overall bond portfolio was approximately years  related to holdings which are heavily weighted with high coupon issues that are expected to be called prior to maturity 
the modified duration of the overall bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was years at december   including collateralized mortgage obligations with modified durations of approximately years and short term investments that carry no duration 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
because it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms  which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
the longer the duration  the greater the price volatility in relation to changes in interest rates 
equity holdings consist of perpetual preferred stocks and dividend bearing common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax sheltered by the corporate dividend exclusion 
at year end  short term investments consisted of highly rated short duration securities redeemable on a daily or weekly basis 
the company does not have any material direct equity investment in subprime lenders

effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
the losses and gains due to changes in fair value for items measured at fair value pursuant to election of the fair value option were included in net realized investment losses and gains 
competitive conditions the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive and consists of a large number of multi state competitors offering automobile  homeowners  commercial property insurance  and other lines 
many of the company s competitors have larger volumes of business and greater financial resources than those of the company 
based on the most recent regularly published statistical compilations of premiums written in  the company was the third largest writer of private passenger automobile insurance in california and the fourteenth largest in the united states 
competitors with greater market share in california sell insurance through exclusive agents  rather than through independent agents and brokers 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  characterized by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity soft market 
in management s view  through was a period of very profitable results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
many in the industry began experiencing declining profitability in and reputation for service and price are the principal means by which the company competes with other automobile insurers 
the company believes that it has a good reputation for service  and it has historically been among the lowest priced insurers doing business in california according to surveys conducted by the california doi 
in addition  the marketing efforts of independent agents and brokers can also provide a competitive advantage 
all rates charged by private passenger automobile insurers in california are subject to the prior approval of the california doi 
see regulation department of insurance oversight 
the company encounters similar competition in each state outside california and line of business in which it operates 
reinsurance the company has reinsurance through the florida hurricane catastrophe trust fund fhcf that provides coverage equal to approximately percent of million in excess of million per occurrence based on the latest information provided by fhcf 
the coverage is expected to change when new information is available later in for california homeowners policies  the company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes by placing earthquake risks with the california earthquake authority the cea 
see regulation insurance assessments 
although the company s catastrophe exposure to earthquakes has been reduced  the company continues to have catastrophe exposure to fires following an earthquake 
the company carries a commercial umbrella reinsurance treaty and seeks facultative arrangements for large property risks 
in addition  the company has other reinsurance in force that is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
if any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under a reinsurance treaty  the company will be required  as primary insurer  to discharge all obligations to its insured in their entirety 
regulation the company is subject to significant regulation and supervision by the doi of each state in which the company operates 
department of insurance oversight the powers of the doi in each state primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors  the establishment of capital and surplus requirements and solvency standards  and restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates 
doi regulations and supervision are designed principally to benefit policyholders rather than shareholders 
california proposition requires that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the california doi prior to their use and that no rate be approved which is excessive  inadequate  unfairly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the initiative 
the proposition specifies four statutory factors required to be applied in decreasing order of importance in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance the insured s driving safety record  the number of miles the insured drives annually  the number of years of driving experience of the insured and whatever optional factors are determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and are adopted by regulation 
the statute further provides that insurers are required to give at least a discount to good drivers  as defined  from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a good driver 
the company s rate plan was approved by the california doi and operates under these rating factor regulations 
insurance rates in georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada require prior approval from the state doi  while insurance rates in illinois  texas  virginia  arizona and michigan must only be filed with the respective doi before they are implemented 
oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
the doi in each state in which the company operates is responsible for conducting periodic financial and market conduct examinations of insurance companies domiciled in their states 
market conduct examinations typically review compliance with insurance statutes and regulations with respect to rating  underwriting  claims handling  billing and other practices 
the following table provides a summary of current financial and market conduct examinations state exam type period under review status ca financial to report was issued in january ca rating underwriting to field work has been completed 
awaiting final report

for discussion of current regulatory matters in california  see regulatory and legal matters in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the operations of the company are dependent on the laws of the states in which it does business and changes in those laws can materially affect the revenue and expenses of the company 
the company retains its own legislative advocates in california 
the company made financial contributions of  and  to officeholders and candidates in and  respectively 
the company believes in supporting the political process and intends to continue to make such contributions in amounts which it determines to be appropriate 
insurance assessments the california insurance guarantee association ciga was created to pay claims on behalf of insolvent property and casualty insurers 
each year  these claims are estimated by ciga and the company is assessed for its pro rata share based on prior year california premiums written in the particular line 
these assessments are limited to of premiums written in the preceding year and are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders the year after the assessment 
the insurance companies in other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations 
during  the company paid approximately million in assessments to the new jersey unsatisfied claim and judgment fund and the new jersey property liability insurance guaranty association for assessments relating to its personal automobile line of business 
as permitted by state law  the new jersey assessments paid during are recoupable through a surcharge to policyholders 
during  the company continued to recoup these assessments and will continue recouping them in it is possible that there will be additional assessments in under gaap  these recoverable assessments of million have been expensed as other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
the company places all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowners policy through the cea 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea  which was recorded as other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon the most recent information provided by the cea  the company s maximum total exposure to cea assessments at april   was approximately million 
holding company act the california companies are subject to california doi regulation pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
the california doi may examine the affairs of each of the california companies at any time 
the holding company act requires disclosure of any material transactions among affiliates within a holding company system 
certain transactions and dividends defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be affected if the california doi disapproves the transaction within days after notice 
such transactions include  but are not limited to  extraordinary dividends  management agreements  service contracts  and cost sharing arrangements  all guarantees that are not quantifiable  derivative transactions or series of derivative transactions  certain reinsurance transactions or modifications thereof in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer s liabilities equals or exceeds percent of the insurer s policyholders surplus as of the preceding december  sales  purchases  exchanges  loans and extensions of credit  and investments  in the net aggregate  involving more than the lesser of of the respective california company s admitted assets or of statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding december an extraordinary dividend is a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year 
an insurance company is also required to notify the california doi of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
there are similar limitations imposed by other states on the insurance companies ability to pay dividends 
as of december   the insurance companies are permitted to pay  without extraordinary doi approval  million in dividends  of which million is payable from the california companies 
the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the california doi 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or of a person that controls a california insurance company  such as mercury general 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the california doi an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
each of the insurance companies is subject to holding company regulations in the states in which it is domiciled  the provisions of which are substantially similar to those of the holding company act 
assigned risks automobile liability insurers in california are required to sell bodily injury liability  property damage liability  medical expense and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number based on the insurer s share of the california automobile casualty insurance market of those drivers applying for placement as assigned risks 
drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics  as defined by proposition  make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market 
in  assigned risks represented less than of total automobile direct premiums written and less than of total automobile direct premium earned 
the company attributes the low level of assignments to the competitive voluntary market 
many of the other states in which the company conducts business offer programs similar to that of california 
these programs are not a significant contributor to the business written in those states

risk factors the company s business involves various risks and uncertainties  some of which are discussed in this section 
the information discussed below should be considered carefully with the other information contained in this annual report on form k and the other documents and materials filed by the company with the sec  as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the company from time to time 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the company  or that it currently believes to be immaterial  may also adversely affect the company s business 
any of the following risks or uncertainties that develop into actual events could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
risks related to the company and its business the company is a holding company that relies on regulated subsidiaries for cash to satisfy its obligations 
as a holding company  the company maintains no operations that generate revenue to pay operating expenses  shareholders dividends or principal or interest on its indebtedness 
consequently  the company relies on the ability of its insurance subsidiaries  and particularly its california insurance subsidiaries  to pay dividends for the company to meet its debt payment obligations and pay other expenses 
the ability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is regulated by state insurance laws  which limit the amount of  and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of  cash dividends 
generally  these insurance regulations permit the payment of dividends only out of earned surplus in any year which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  do not exceed the greater of of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or the net income for the preceding year  with larger dividends payable only after receipt of prior regulatory approval 
the inability of the company s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable the company to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
if the company s loss reserves are inadequate  its business and financial position could be harmed 
the process of establishing property and liability loss reserves is inherently uncertain due to a number of factors  including underwriting quality  the frequency and amount of covered losses  variations in claims settlement practices  the costs and uncertainty of litigation  and expanding theories of liability 
while the company believes that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted in estimating loss reserves  the company s methods may prove to be inadequate 
if any of these contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control  results in loss reserves that are not sufficient to cover its actual losses  its results of operations  liquidity and financial position may be materially adversely affected 
the company s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders 
the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations depend on the company s ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it faces 
premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
in order to price its products accurately  the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test and apply appropriate rating formulae  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
the company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully  and as a result  price accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation availability of sufficient reliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions  generally  selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  successful innovation of new pricing strategies  recognition of changes in trends and in the projected severity and frequency of losses  the company s ability to forecast renewals of existing policies accurately  unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action  ongoing changes in the company s claim settlement practices  changes in operating expenses  changing driving patterns  extra contractual liability arising from bad faith claims  weather catastrophes  unexpected medical inflation  and unanticipated inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices and used car prices 
such risks may result in the company s pricing being based on outdated  inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses  assumptions or methodologies  and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  the company could underprice risks  which would negatively affect the company s margins  or it could overprice risks  which could reduce the company s volume and competitiveness 
in either event  the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the company s business are uncertain and may have an adverse effect on the company s business 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the company s business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after the company has issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under the company s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued 
the company s private passenger insurance rates are subject to prior approval by the departments of insurance in most of the states in which the company operates  and to political influences 
in most of the states in which the company operates  it must obtain prior approval from the state department of insurance of the private passenger insurance rates charged to its customers  including any increases in those rates 
if the company is unable to receive approval of the rate increases it requests  the company s ability to operate its business in a profitable manner may be limited and its liquidity  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
from time to time  the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators and special interest groups to reduce  freeze or set rates at levels that do not correspond with underlying costs  in the opinion of the company s management 
the homeowners insurance business faces similar pressure  particularly as regulators in catastrophe prone states seek an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
in addition  various insurance underwriting and pricing criteria regularly come under attack by regulators  legislators and special interest groups 
the result could be legislation or regulations that would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company remains highly dependent upon california and several other key states to produce revenues and operating profits 
for the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its direct automobile insurance premiums written in california  in florida and in new jersey 
the company s financial results are therefore subject to prevailing regulatory  legal  economic  demographic  competitive and other conditions in these states and changes in any of these conditions could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
acquired companies can be difficult to integrate  disrupt the company s business and adversely affect its operating results 
the benefits anticipated in an acquisition may not be realized in the manner anticipated 
effective january   the company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of ais management  llc  which is the parent company of auto insurance specialists  llc  and poliseek ais insurance solutions  inc with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits including  among other things  enhanced revenue and profits  greater market presence and development  and enhancements to the company s product portfolio and customer base 
these benefits may not be realized as rapidly as  or to the extent  anticipated by the company 
costs incurred in the integration of the ais operations with the company s operations also could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
if these risks materialize  the company s stock price could be materially adversely affected 
the acquisition of ais  as with all acquisitions  involves numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating ais operations  technologies  services and personnel  potential loss of ais customers  diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations  potential loss of key ais employees  integrating personnel with diverse business and cultural backgrounds  preserving ais s important industry  marketing and customer relationships  assumption of liabilities held by ais  and inability to generate sufficient revenue and cost savings to offset the cost of the acquisition 
the company s acquisition of ais may also cause it to assume and otherwise become subject to certain liabilities  incur additional debt  such as the million debt incurred to fund the acquisition  make write offs and incur restructuring and other related expenses  and create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges and or amortization expense 
as a result  if the company fails to properly evaluate  execute the acquisition of and integrate ais  its business and prospects may be seriously harmed 
if the company cannot maintain its am best ratings  it may not be able to maintain premium volume in its insurance operations sufficient to attain the company s financial performance goals 
the company s ability to retain its existing business or to attract new business in its insurance operations is affected by its rating by am best company 
am best company currently rates all of the company s insurance subsidiaries with sufficient operating history to be rated as either a superior or a excellent 
if the company is unable to maintain its am best ratings  the company may not be able to grow its premium volume sufficiently to attain its financial performance goals  and if am best were to downgrade the company s rating  the company could lose significant premium volume 
the company s ability to access capital markets  its financing arrangements  and its business operations are dependent on favorable evaluations and ratings by credit and other rating agencies 
financial strength and claims paying ability ratings issued by firms such as standard poor s  fitch  and moody s have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
the company s ability to attract and retain policies is affected by its ratings with these agencies 
rating agencies assign ratings based upon their evaluations of an insurance company s ability to meet its financial obligations 
the company s financial strength ratings with standard poor s  fitch  and moody s are aa  aa  and aa  respectively  its respective debt ratings are a  a  and a in february   the ratings were affirmed by standard poor s and fitch  but the outlook for the ratings was changed from stable to negative while moody s maintained a stable outlook 
since these ratings are subject to continuous review  the company cannot guarantee the continuation of the favorable ratings 
if the ratings were lowered significantly by any one of these agencies relative to those of the company s competitors  its ability to market products to new customers and to renew the policies of current customers could be harmed 
a lowering of the ratings could also limit the company s access to the capital markets or adversely affect pricing of new debt sought in the capital markets 
these events  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on the company s net income and liquidity 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements  and any failure to meet these requirements could subject the company s insurance subsidiaries to regulatory action 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable laws of their state of domicile 
the risk based capital standards  based upon the risk based capital model act adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  require the company s insurance subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to state departments of insurance and the naic 
if any of the company s insurance subsidiaries fails to meet these standards and requirements  the department of insurance regulating such subsidiary may require specified actions by the subsidiary 
there is uncertainty involved in the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables 
the company reinsures a portion of its potential losses on the policies it issues to mitigate the volatility of the losses on its financial condition and results of operations 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions  which are outside of the company s control 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases prevented  insurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
as a result  the company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer a portion of the company s risk through reinsurance arrangements 
in addition  as is customary  the company initially pays all claims and seeks to recover the reinsured losses from its reinsurers 
although the company reports as assets the amount of claims paid which the company expects to recover from reinsurers  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to collect from its reinsurers 
if the amounts actually recoverable under the company s reinsurance treaties are ultimately determined to be less than the amount it has reported as recoverable  the company may incur a loss during the period in which that determination is made 
the company depends on independent agents who may discontinue sales of its policies at any time 
the company sells its insurance policies through approximately  independent agents and brokers 
the company must compete with other insurance carriers for these agents and brokers business 
some competitors offer a larger variety of products  lower prices for insurance coverage  higher commissions  or more attractive non cash incentives 
to maintain its relationship with these independent agents  the company must pay competitive commissions  be able to respond to their needs quickly and adequately  and create a consistently high level of customer satisfaction 
if these independent agents find it preferable to do business with the company s competitors  it would be difficult to renew the company s existing business or attract new business 
state regulations may also limit the manner in which the company s producers are compensated or incentivized 
such developments could negatively impact the company s relationship with these parties and ultimately reduce revenues 
changes in market interest rates or defaults may have an adverse effect on the company s investment portfolio  which may adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s results are affected  in part  by the performance of its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments  such as municipal and corporate bonds 
increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of the investment portfolio by decreasing unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities 
declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on the company s investment income as it invests positive cash flows from operations and as it reinvests proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than the company s investments have historically generated 
defaults in the company s investment portfolio may produce operating losses and reduce the company s capital and surplus 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond the company s control 
although the company takes measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  it may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
the company s mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio and managing the duration of the portfolio to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
despite its mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s book value 
changes in the financial strength ratings of financial guaranty insurers issuing policies on bonds held in the company s investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on the company s investment results 
in an effort to enhance the bond rating applicable to a certain bond issues  some bond issuers purchase municipal bond insurance policies from private insurers 
the insurance generally guarantees the payment of principal and interest on a bond issue if the issuer defaults 
by purchasing the insurance  the financial strength ratings applicable to the bonds are based on the credit worthiness of the insurer rather than the underlying credit of the bond issuer 
several financial guaranty insurers that have issued insurance policies covering bonds held by the company are facing financial strength rating downgrades due to risk exposures on insurance policies that guarantee mortgage debt and related structured products 
these financial guaranty insurers are subject to doi oversight 
as the financial strength ratings of these insurers are reduced  the ratings of the insured bond issues correspondingly decrease 
although the company has determined that the financial strength rating of the underlying bond issues in its investment portfolio are within the company s investment policy without the enhancement provided by the insurance policies  any further downgrades in the financial strength ratings of these insurance companies or any defaults on the insurance policies written by these insurance companies may reduce the fair value of the underlying bond issues and the company s investment portfolio or may reduce the investment results generated by the company s investment portfolio  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the company s business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
the company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events  particularly hurricanes  earthquakes  hail storms  explosions  tropical storms  fires  war  acts of terrorism  severe winter weather and other natural and man made disasters 
such events typically increase the frequency and severity of automobile and other property claims 
because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable  historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations  and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events is likely to result in substantial volatility in the company s financial condition and results of operations from period to period 
although the company attempts to manage its exposure to such events  the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid 
the company s expansion plans may adversely affect its future profitability 
the company is currently expanding and intends to further expand its operations in several of the states in which the company has operations and into states in which it has not yet begun operations 
the intended expansion will necessitate increased expenditures 
the company expects to fund these expenditures out of cash flow from operations 
the expansion may not occur  or if it does occur may not be successful in providing increased revenues or profitability 
if the company s cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover the increased costs of the expansion  or if the expansion does not provide the benefits anticipated  the company s financial condition and results of operations and ability to grow its business may be harmed 
the company may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
the company s future capital requirements depend on many factors  including its ability to write new business successfully  its ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses  the success of its current expansion plans and the performance of its investment portfolio 
the company may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing  sales of all or a portion of its investment portfolio or curtail its growth and reduce its assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may not be available on terms that are favorable to the company 
in the case of equity financing  the company s shareholders could experience dilution 
in addition  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the company s current shareholders 
if the company cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  its business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
any inability of the company to realize its deferred tax assets may have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and its financial condition 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for tax credits 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence  including assumptions about future profitability and capital gain generation 
although management believes that it is more likely than not that that the deferred tax assets will be realized  some or all of the company s deferred tax assets could expire unused if the company is unable to generate taxable capital gains in the future sufficient to utilize them or the company enters into one or more transactions that limit its right to realize all of the deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce the deferred tax asset through a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination is made 
this charge could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the assumptions used to make this determination are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between the company s future projected operating performance and actual results 
as a result  significant management judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
for these reasons and because changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the company s results of operations and financial condition  management has included the assessment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate 
continued deterioration of the municipal bond market in general or of specific municipal bonds held by the company may result in a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations and its financial condition 
at december   approximately of the company s total investment portfolio at fair value and of its total fixed maturity investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt municipal bonds 
approximately of the net losses held in the company s investment portfolio at december  related to the company s municipal bond holdings 
with such a large percentage of the company s investment portfolio invested in municipal bonds  the performance of the company s investment portfolio  including the cash flows generated by the investment portfolio is significantly dependent on the performance of municipal bonds 
if the value of municipal bond markets in general or any of the company s municipal bond holdings continue to deteriorate  the performance of the company s investment portfolio  results of operations  financial position and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 
the company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business  and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on the accuracy  reliability and proper functioning of its information technology systems 
the company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business  including underwriting  policy acquisition  claims processing and handling  accounting  reserving and actuarial processes and policies  and to maintain its policyholder data 
the company is developing and deploying new information technology systems that are designed to manage many of these functions across all of the states in which it operates and all of the lines of insurance it offers 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations technology 
the failure of hardware or software that supports the company s information technology systems  the loss of data contained in the systems  or any delay or failure in the full deployment of the company s new information technology systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums  increased overhead costs and inaccurate reporting  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  despite system redundancy  the implementation of security measures and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the company s information technology systems  these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers  power loss  unauthorized access  and computer systems  internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
it is possible that a system failure  accident or security breach could result in a material disruption to the company s business 
in addition  substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 
following implementation of its new information technology systems  the company may from time to time install new or upgraded business management systems 
to the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner  the company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
changes in accounting standards issued by the fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  the company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes the company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s results and financial condition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
the company s management  including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and the company cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec require the company to include in its form k a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
areas of the company s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if the company s independent auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the company s financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on its stock price 
the company may be required to adopt international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively impact its business  financial condition or results of operations 
although not yet required  the company could be required to adopt ifrs  which is different than us gaap  for the company s accounting and reporting standards 
the implementation and adoption of new standards could favorably or unfavorably impact the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the ability of the company to attract  develop and retain talented employees  managers and executives  and to maintain appropriate staffing levels  is critical to the company s success 
as the company expands its operations  it must hire and train new employees  and retain current employees to handle the resulting increase in new inquiries  policies  customers and claims 
the failure of the company to successfully hire and retain a sufficient number of skilled employees could result in the company having to slow the growth of its business in some jurisdictions 
it could also affect the company s ability to develop and deploy information technology systems that are important to the success of the company 
in addition  the failure to adequately staff its claims and underwriting departments could result in decreased quality of the company s claims and underwriting operations 
the company s success also depends heavily upon the continued contributions of its executive officers  both individually and as a group 
the company s future performance will be substantially dependent on its ability to retain and motivate its management team 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers could prevent the company from successfully implementing its business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the insurance industry has been the target of litigation  and the company faces litigation risks which  if decided adversely to the company  could impact its financial results 
in recent years  insurance companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits including class actions  relating to pricing  sales practices and practices in claims handling  among other matters 
a number of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial jury awards or settlements involving other insurers 
future litigation relating to these or other business practices may negatively affect the company by requiring it to pay substantial awards or settlements  increasing the company s legal costs  diverting management attention from other business issues or harming the company s reputation with customers 
such litigation is inherently unpredictable 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits 
these lawsuits are described more fully in item legal proceedings 
litigation  by its very nature  is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain 
the precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuits is uncertain and may  if these lawsuits are determined adversely to the company  negatively impact the manner in which the company conducts its business and its results of operations  which could materially increase the company s costs and expenses 
in addition  potential litigation involving new claim  coverage and business practice issues could adversely affect the company s business by changing the way policies are priced  extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or increasing the size of claims 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim  coverage and business practice issues could negatively impact the company s financial condition  revenues or its methods of doing business 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods employed by the company could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
various provisions of the company s policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which are intended to limit the company s risks  may not be enforceable in the manner the company intends 
in addition  the company s policies contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims and the company s right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition 
while the company s insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the company s loss exposure and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks  it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect the company s loss experience  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
general economic conditions may affect the company s revenue and profitability and harm its business 
financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have experienced and continue to experience extreme disruption in recent months  and the united states and other countries are currently in a severe economic recession 
unfavorable changes in economic conditions  including continuing stock market declines  inflation  recession  declining consumer confidence or other changes  may reduce the company s premium volume through policy cancellations  modifications or non renewals  may reduce cash flows from operations and investments  may harm the company s financial position and may reduce the insurance companies statutory surplus 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of the company s customers to pay premiums as they fall due  and as a result  the company s reserves and write offs could increase 
the significant losses in the company s investment portfolio could also continue if the losses in the financial markets in general continue 
the company is unable to predict the duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries 
if economic conditions in the united states continue to deteriorate or do not show improvement  the adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows may continue 
continued deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to additional investment losses and materially and adversely affect the company s business 
the prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including among other things  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions  have resulted in significant losses in the company s investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   the company incurred substantial realized investment losses  as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part i 
continued deterioration in the financial markets could lead to additional investment losses 
funding for the company s future growth may depend upon obtaining new financing  which may be difficult to obtain given prevalent economic conditions and the general credit crisis 
to accommodate the company s expected future growth  the company may require funding in addition to cash provided from current operations 
the company s ability to obtain financing may be constrained by current economic conditions affecting global financial markets 
specifically  the recent credit crisis and other related trends affecting the banking industry have caused significant operating losses and bankruptcies throughout the banking industry 
many lenders and institutional investors have ceased funding even the most credit worthy borrowers 
if the company is unable to obtain necessary financing  it may be unable to take advantage of opportunities with potential business partners or new products or to otherwise expand its business as planned 
risks related to the company s industry the private passenger automobile insurance business is highly competitive  and the company may not be able to compete effectively against larger  better capitalized companies 
the company competes with many property and casualty insurance companies selling private passenger automobile insurance in the states in which the company operates  many of which are better capitalized than the company and have higher am best ratings 
the superior capitalization of many of the company s competitors may enable them to offer lower rates  to withstand larger losses  and to take advantage more effectively of new marketing opportunities 
the company s competition may also become increasingly better capitalized in the future as the traditional barriers between insurance companies and banks and other financial institutions erode and as the property and casualty industry continues to consolidate 
the company s ability to compete against these larger  better capitalized competitors depends importantly on its ability to deliver superior service and its strong relationships with independent agents 
the company may from time to time undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve its competitive position and drive growth 
if the company is unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if the company s marketing campaigns do not attract new customers  the company s competitive position may be harmed  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
additionally  in a highly competitive industry such as the automobile insurance industry  some of the company s competitors may fail from time to time 
in the event of a failure of a major insurance company  the company could be adversely affected  as the company and other insurance companies would likely be required by state law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer  and as the company would be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer s former policyholders 
the company may be adversely affected by changes in the personal automobile insurance business 
approximately of the company s direct written premiums for the year ended december  were generated from personal automobile insurance policies 
adverse developments in the market for personal automobile insurance  or the personal automobile insurance industry in general  whether related to changes in competition  pricing or regulations  could cause the company s results of operations to suffer 
this industry is also exposed to the risks of severe weather conditions  such as rainstorms  snowstorms  hail and ice storms  hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes and  to a lesser degree  explosions  terrorist attacks and riots 
the automobile insurance business is also affected by cost trends that impact profitability 
factors which negatively affect cost trends include inflation in automobile repair costs  automobile parts costs  used car prices and medical care 
increased litigation of claims  particularly those involving allegations of bad faith or seeking extra contractual and punitive damages  may also adversely affect loss costs 
the insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation  which may affect the company s ability to execute its business plan and grow its business 
the company is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of the states in which its insurance subsidiaries is domiciled  as well as in the states where its insurance subsidiaries sell insurance products  issue policies and handle claims 
some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to operate  innovate  obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow its business profitably 
these regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of shareholders 
the company s ability to comply with these laws and regulations  and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner  is and will continue to be critical to its success 
some of these regulations include required licensing 
the company operates under licenses issued by the departments of insurance in the states in which the company sells insurance 
if a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license  the company s ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired 
also  if the department of insurance in any state in which the company currently operates suspends  non renews  or revokes an existing license  the company would not be able to offer affected products in the state 
transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates 
transactions between the company s insurance subsidiaries and their affiliates including the company generally must be disclosed to state regulators  and prior approval of the applicable regulator generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated 
state regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of some transactions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to innovate or operate efficiently 
regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms 
the insurance laws of most states in which the company conducts business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval 
if  as permitted in some states  the company begins using new rates before they are approved  it may be required to issue refunds or credits to the company s policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator 
accordingly  the company s ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected 
restrictions on cancellation  non renewal or withdrawal 
most of the states in which the company operates have laws and regulations that limit its ability to exit a market 
for example  these states may limit a private passenger auto insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies or they may prohibit the company from withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state unless prior approval is received from the state insurance department 
in some states  these regulations extend to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written  not just to a complete withdrawal 
laws and regulations that limit the company s ability to cancel and non renew policies in some states or locations and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict the company s ability to exit unprofitable markets  which may harm its business and results of operations 
other regulations 
the company must also comply with regulations involving  among other things the use of non public consumer information and related privacy issues  the use of credit history in underwriting and rating  limitations on the ability to charge policy fees  limitations on types and amounts of investments  the payment of dividends  the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  involuntary assignments of high risk policies  participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations  assessments and other governmental charges  reporting with respect to financial condition  periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners  and the other regulations discussed in this annual report on form k 
compliance with laws and regulations addressing these and other issues often will result in increased administrative costs 
in addition  these laws and regulations may limit the company s ability to underwrite and price risks accurately  prevent it from obtaining timely rate increases necessary to cover increased costs and may restrict its ability to discontinue unprofitable relationships or exit unprofitable markets 
these results  in turn  may adversely affect the company s profitability or its ability or desire to grow its business in certain jurisdictions  which could have an adverse effect on the market value of the company s common stock 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in actions by regulators  fines and penalties  and in extreme cases  revocation of the company s ability to do business in that jurisdiction 
in addition  the company may face individual and class action lawsuits by insureds and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 
regulation may become more extensive in the future  which may adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that states will not make existing insurance related laws and regulations more restrictive in the future or enact new restrictive laws 
new or more restrictive regulation in any state in which the company conducts business could make it more expensive for it to continue to conduct business in these states  restrict the premiums the company is able to charge or otherwise change the way the company does business 
in such events  the company may seek to reduce its writings in  or to withdraw entirely from  these states 
in addition  from time to time  the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 
the company cannot predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted  the timing of any such adoption and what effects  if any  they may have on the company s operations  profitability and financial condition 
assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds  second injury funds  catastrophe funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce the company s profitability 
virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
many states also have laws that established second injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury which are funded by either assessments based on paid losses or premium surcharge mechanisms 
in addition  as a condition to the ability to conduct business in various states  the insurance subsidiaries must participate in mandatory property and casualty shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements  which provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers 
the effect of these assessments and mandatory shared market mechanisms or changes in them could reduce the company s profitability in any given period or limit its ability to grow its business 
loss or significant restriction of the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of personal lines products could reduce the company s future profitability 
the company uses credit scoring as a factor in pricing decisions where allowed by state law 
some consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against people with low incomes  minority groups and the elderly and are calling for the prohibition or restriction on the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing 
laws or regulations that significantly curtail the use of credit scoring  if enacted in a large number of states  could reduce the company s future profitability 
risks related to the company s stock the company is controlled by a few large shareholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including change of control transactions 
george joseph and gloria joseph collectively own more than of the company s common stock 
accordingly  george joseph and gloria joseph have the ability to exert significant influence on the actions the company may take in the future  including change of control transactions 
this concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the company s other shareholders and the holders of its debt securities 
future sales of common stock may affect the market price of the company s common stock and the future exercise of options and warrants will result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company may raise capital in the future through the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  such future sales will have on the market price of its common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the company s outstanding common stock  and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell common stock at a time and price that the shareholder deems appropriate 
in addition  the company has issued options to purchase shares of its common stock 
in the event that any options to purchase common stock are exercised  shareholders will suffer dilution in their investment 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of the company or the sale of any of its insurance subsidiaries 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company or any holding company of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the doi of the state where the insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of the insurer or holding company  the state doi will consider a number of factors relating to the acquiror and the transaction 
these laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company or the sale by the company of any of its insurance subsidiaries  including transactions that some or all of the company s shareholders might consider to be desirable 
although the company has consistently paid cash dividends in the past  it may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future 
the company has paid cash dividends on a consistent basis since the public offering of its common stock in november however  future cash dividends will depend upon a variety of factors  including the company s profitability  financial condition  capital needs  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
the company s ability to pay dividends may also be limited by the ability of the insurance companies to make distributions to the company  which may be restricted by financial  regulatory or tax constraints  and by the terms of the company s debt instruments 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial and regulatory conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution

the company is headquartered in los angeles  california and operates primarily as a personal automobile insurer selling policies through a network of independent agents and brokers in thirteen states 
the company also offers homeowners insurance  mechanical breakdown insurance  commercial and dwelling fire insurance  umbrella insurance  commercial automobile and commercial property insurance 
private passenger automobile lines of insurance accounted for approximately of the billion of the company s direct premiums written in approximately of the private passenger automobile premiums were written in california 
the company operates primarily in the state of california  the only state in which it operated prior to the company has since expanded its operations into the following states georgia and illinois  oklahoma and texas  florida  virginia and new york  new jersey  and arizona  pennsylvania  michigan and nevada 
this overview discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the company s performance  prospects and risks 
it is not all inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of management s discussion and analysis  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and all other items contained within this annual report on form k 
economic and industry wide factors regulatory uncertainty the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates 
state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including  in some states  approving rate changes and rating factors and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements 
in many states  insurance commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners 
the company has a successful track record of working with difficult regulations and new insurance commissioners 
however  there is no certainty that current or future regulations and the interpretation of those regulations by insurance commissioners and the courts will not have an adverse impact on the company 
cost uncertainty because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected  the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned 
consequently  significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves 
while insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves  there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will approve rate increases when the company s actuarial analysis shows that they are needed 
market volatility the prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including among other things  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions  have resulted in significant losses in the company s investment portfolio as a result  depending on market conditions  the company may incur substantial additional losses in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  equity  business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
inflation the largest cost component for automobile insurers is losses  which include medical costs  replacement automobile parts and labor costs 
there can be significant variation in the overall increases in medical cost inflation and it is often a year or more after the respective fiscal period ends before sufficient claims have closed for the inflation rate to be known with a reasonable degree of certainty 
therefore  it can be difficult to establish reserves and set premium rates  particularly when actual inflation rates may be higher or lower than anticipated 
loss frequency another component of overall loss costs is loss frequency  which is the number of claims per risks insured 
there has been a long term trend of declining loss frequency in the personal automobile insurance industry  which has benefited the industry as a whole 
it is unknown if loss frequency in the future will decline  remain flat or increase 
underwriting cycle and competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with alternating hard and soft market conditions 
the company has historically seen premium growth in excess of during hard markets 
premium growth rates in soft markets have been from slightly positive to negative and in they were negative 
in management s view  through was a period of very profitable results for companies underwriting automobile insurance 
many in the industry began experiencing declining profitability in and and are now increasing rates 
rate increases generally indicate that the market is hardening 
revenues  income and cash generation the company generates its revenues through the sale of insurance policies  primarily covering personal automobiles and homeowners 
these policies are sold through independent agents and brokers who receive a commission averaging of net premiums written for selling and servicing policies 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts for name recognition and lead generation 
the company believes that its marketing efforts  combined with its ability to maintain relatively low prices and a strong reputation make the company very competitive in california and in other states 
net advertising expenditures were approximately million and million during and  respectively 
the company believes that it has a thorough underwriting process that gives the company an advantage over its competitors 
the company views its agent relationships and underwriting process as one of its primary competitive advantages because it allows the company to charge lower prices yet realize better margins than many competitors 
the company also generated income from its investment portfolio 
approximately million in pre tax investment income was generated during on a portfolio of approximately billion at fair market value at december   compared to million pre tax investment income during on a portfolio of approximately billion at fair market value at december  the portfolio is managed by company personnel with a view towards maximizing after tax yields and limiting interest rate and credit risk 
the company s operating results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations  which was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
cash flow from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and to help support growth 
opportunities  challenges and risks the company currently underwrites personal automobile insurance in thirteen states arizona  california  florida  georgia  illinois  michigan  nevada  new jersey  new york  oklahoma  pennsylvania  texas and virginia 
the company expects to continue its growth by expanding into new states in future years with the objective of achieving greater geographic diversification 
there are  however  challenges and risks involved in entering each new state  including establishing adequate rates without any operating history in the state  working with a new regulatory regime  hiring and training competent personnel  building adequate systems and finding qualified agents to represent the company 
the company does not expect to enter into any new states during the company is also subject to risks inherent in its business  which include but are not limited to the following see also item a 
risk factors 
a catastrophe  such as a major wildfire  earthquake or hurricane  could cause a significant amount of loss to the company in a very short period of time 
a major regulatory change could make it more difficult for the company to generate new business or reduce the profitability of the company s existing business 
a sharp upward increase in market interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could cause a significant loss in the value of the company s investment portfolio 
to the extent it is within the company s control  the company seeks to manage these risks in order to mitigate the effect that major events would have on the company s financial position 
technology in  the company launched its new internet agency portal  mercury first  in new york 
the mercury first rollout is continuing to all states through mercury first is a single entry point for agents and brokers that provides a broad suite of capabilities 
one of its most powerful tools is a point of sale pos system that allows agents and brokers to easily obtain and compare quotes and write new business 
the pos for private passenger auto is already in use 
pos solutions for commercial auto and homeowner are planned to be in use by agents in mercury first is also an easy to use agency portal that provides a customized work queue for each agency user showing new business leads  underwriting requests and other pertinent customer information in real time 
agents can also assist customers with paying bills  reporting claims or updating their records 
the system enables quick access to documents and forms as well as empowering the agents with several self service capabilities 
the company began developing its nextgen computer system in to replace its legacy underwriting  billings  claims and commissions systems 
the nextgen system was designed to be a multi state  multi line system to enable the company to enter new states more rapidly  as well as respond to legislative and regulatory changes more easily 
the company completed rollout of nextgen for all underwriting  billing  claims and commission functions supporting private passenger auto in seven states virginia  new york  florida  california  georgia  illinois  and texas 
the legacy private passenger auto system has been retired 
as part of the company s commitment to service excellence  the company launched an initiative in to improve its call center technologies 
the initiative s goal is to enhance telephony infrastructure using voice over internet protocol  centralized call recording  quality monitoring and workforce management software 
the technology has been integrated with the company s claim processing software and deployed to the centralized customer service call center 
during  this technology will be rolled out to other claims processing field offices 
regulatory and legal matters the process for implementing rate changes varies by state  with california  georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania and nevada requiring prior approval from the doi before a rate may be implemented 
illinois  texas  virginia  arizona and michigan only require that rates be filed with the doi  while oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
during  the company implemented automobile and homeowners insurance rate decreases in california that were initially filed in august and approved by the california doi in january as part of the company s compliance with regulations proposed by the california doi and approved in july  as more fully described below 
in five other states  the company implemented automobile rate increases 
the california doi uses rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined in decreasing order of importance by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience and other factors as determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
in april  regulations became effective that generally tighten the existing proposition prior approval ratemaking regime primarily by establishing a maximum allowable rate of return calculated by adding percent plus the average of short  intermediate  and long term t bill rates and a minimum allowable rate of return of negative percent of surplus 
however  the practical impact of these limitations is unclear because the new regulations allow for the california doi to grant a number of variances based on loss prevention  business mix  service to underserved communities  and other factors 
in october  the california doi invited comments from consumer groups and the insurance industry in an effort to set appropriate standards for granting or denying specific variances and to provide sufficient instruction regarding what information or data to submit when an insurer is applying for a specific variance 
the comment period ended on november  the california doi then published proposed amendments to its regulations and held an informal workshop on them on april  on april   the commissioner issued a new notice reflecting slight modifications to the proposed regulations and superseding the prior version 
the proposed changes were approved as emergency regulations by the office of administrative law oal on may  and became effective as of that date 
on july   the california oal approved proposed regulations by the california doi that effectively reduce the weight that insurers can place on a person s residence when establishing automobile insurance rates 
insurance companies in california are required to file rating plans with the california doi that comply with the new regulations 
there is a two year phase in period for insurers to fully implement those plans 
the company made a rate filing in august that reduced the territorial impact of its rates and requested a small overall rate increase 
the california doi approved the august filing in january  which resulted in a small rate increase for two of the california insurance subsidiaries and a small decrease for a third  for a total net rate reduction of approximately 
the newly approved rates went into effect in april in july  the company made an additional rate filing to bring its rates into full compliance with the new regulations 
however  the company cannot predict whether the california doi will determine that the company s rates are in full compliance with the new regulations as a result of this filing 
in general  the company expects that the regulations will cause rates for urban drivers to decrease and those for non urban drivers to increase 
these rate changes are likely to increase consumer shopping for insurance which could affect the volume and the retention rates of the company s business 
it is the company s intention to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace while complying with the new regulations 
in march  the california doi issued an amended notice of non compliance nnc to the nnc originally issued in february alleging that the company charged rates in violation of the california insurance code  willfully permitted its agents to charge broker fees in violation of california law  and willfully misrepresented the actual price insurance consumers could expect to pay for insurance by the amount of a fee charged by the consumer s insurance broker 
through this action  the california doi seeks to impose a fine for each policy in which the company allegedly permitted an agent to charge a broker fee  which the california doi contends is the use of an unapproved rate  rating plan or rating system 
further  the california doi seeks to impose a penalty for each and every date on which the company allegedly used a misleading advertisement alleged in the nnc 
finally  based upon the conduct alleged  the california doi also contends that the company acted fraudulently in violation of section a of the california insurance code  which permits the california commissioner of insurance to suspend certificates of authority for a period of one year 
the company filed a notice of defense in response to the nnc 
the company does not believe that it has done anything to warrant a monetary penalty from the california doi 
the san francisco superior court  in robert krumme  on behalf of the general public v 
mercury insurance company  mercury casualty company  and california automobile insurance company  denied plaintiff s requests for restitution or any other form of retrospective monetary relief based on the same facts and legal theory 
the matter is currently in discovery and a hearing before the administrative law judge is scheduled to start on march  this matter has been the subject of five continuations since the original nnc was issued in the company is not able to determine the impact of any of the legal and regulatory matters described above 
it is possible that the impact of some of the changes could adversely affect the company and its operating results  however  the ultimate outcome is not expected to be material to the company s financial position 
the california franchise tax board ftb has audited the through and tax returns and accepted the through returns to be correct as filed 
the company received a notice of examination for the tax return from the ftb in january for the company s   and tax returns  the ftb has taken exception to the state apportionment factors used by the company 
specifically  the ftb has asserted that payroll and property factors from mercury insurance services  llc  a subsidiary of mercury casualty company  that are excluded from the mercury general california franchise tax return  should be included in the california apportionment factors 
in addition  for the tax return  the ftb has asserted that a portion of management fee expenses paid by mercury insurance services  llc should be disallowed 
based on these assertions  the ftb has issued notices of proposed tax assessments for the  and tax years totaling approximately million 
the company strongly disagrees with the position taken by the ftb and plans to formally appeal the assessments before the california state board of equalization sbe 
an unfavorable ruling against the company may have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the period of such ruling 
management believes that the issue will ultimately be resolved in favor of the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will prevail on this matter 
the company is also involved in legal proceedings incidental to its insurance business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies litigation 
critical accounting estimates reserves the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires judgment and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas no 
 and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is required 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials and labor rates  among other factors  can all impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of a claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the company calculates a point estimate rather than a range of loss reserve estimates 
there is inherent uncertainty with estimates and this is particularly true with estimates for loss reserves 
this uncertainty comes from many factors which may include changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  uncertainty over inflation rates and uncertainty for unknown items 
the company does not make specific provisions for these uncertainties  rather it considers them in establishing its reserve by looking at historical patterns and trends and projecting these out to current reserves 
the underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the reserve estimate include paid and incurred loss development factors  expected average costs per claim  inflation trends  expected loss ratios  industry data and other relevant information 
the company also engages independent actuarial consultants to review the company s reserves and to provide the annual actuarial opinions required under state statutory accounting requirements 
the company does not rely on actuarial consultants for gaap reporting or periodic report disclosure purposes 
the company analyzes loss reserves quarterly primarily using the incurred loss development  average severity and claim count development methods described below 
the company also uses the paid loss development method to analyze loss adjustment expense reserves and industry claims data as part of its reserve analysis 
when deciding which method to use in estimating its reserves  the company evaluates the credibility of each method based on the maturity of the data available and the claims settlement practices for each particular line of business or coverage within a line of business 
when establishing the reserve  the company will generally analyze the results from all of the methods used rather than relying on one method 
while these methods are designed to determine the ultimate losses on claims under the company s policies  there is inherent uncertainty in all actuarial models since they use historical data to project outcomes 
the company believes that the techniques it uses provide a reasonable basis in estimating loss reserves 
the incurred loss development method analyzes historical incurred case loss case reserves plus paid losses development to estimate ultimate losses 
the company applies development factors against current case incurred losses by accident period to calculate ultimate expected losses 
the company believes that the incurred loss development method provides a reasonable basis for evaluating ultimate losses  particularly in the company s larger  more established lines of business which have a long operating history 
the claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate future incurred claim count development for current claims 
the company applies these development factors against current claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate expected claim counts 
the average severity method analyzes historical loss payments and or incurred losses divided by closed claims and or total claims to calculate an estimated average cost per claim 
from this  the expected ultimate average cost per claim can be estimated 
the average severity method coupled with the claim count development method provide meaningful information regarding inflation and frequency trends that the company believes is useful in establishing reserves 
the paid loss development method analyzes historical payment patterns to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid 
the company primarily uses this method for loss adjustment expenses because specific case reserves are generally not established for loss adjustment expenses 
in states with little operating history where there are insufficient claims data to prepare a reserve analysis relying solely on company historical data  the company generally projects ultimate losses using industry average loss data or expected loss ratios 
as the company develops an operating history in these states  the company will rely increasingly on the incurred loss development and average severity and claim count development methods 
the company analyzes catastrophe losses separately from non catastrophe losses 
for catastrophe losses  the company determines claim counts based on claims reported and development expectations from previous catastrophes and applies an average expected loss per claim based on reserves established by adjusters and average losses on previous similar catastrophes 
there are many factors that can cause variability between the ultimate expected loss and the actual developed loss 
because the actual loss for a particular accident period is unknown until all claims have settled for that period  the company must estimate what it expects that loss to be 
while there are certainly other factors  the company believes that the following items tend to create the most variability between expected losses and actual losses variability in inflation expectations particularly on coverages that take longer to settle such as the california automobile bodily injury coverage 
variability in the number of claims reported subsequent to a period end relating to that period particularly on coverages that take longer to settle such as the california automobile bodily injury coverage 
variability between company loss experience and industry averages for those lines of business that the company is relying on industry averages to establish reserves 
unexpected large individual losses or groups of losses arising from older accident periods typically caused by an event that is not reflected in the historical company data used to establish reserves 
these items are discussed in detail inflation variability california automobile lines of business for the company s california automobile lines of business  the bodily injury bi reserves comprise approximately of the total reserve  material damage  including collision  comprehensive  and property damage md reserves make up approximately of the total reserve  and loss adjustment expense reserves make up approximately of the total reserve 
the bi reserves account for such a large portion of the total because bi claims tend to close much slower than md claims 
the majority of the loss adjustment expense reserves consist of estimated costs to defend bi claims  so those reserves also tend to close more slowly than md claims 
loss development on md reserves is generally insignificant because md claims are closed quickly 
bi loss reserves are generally the most difficult to estimate because they take longer to close than most of the company s other coverages 
the company s bi policy covers injuries sustained by any person other than the insured  except in the case of uninsured and underinsured motorist bi coverage  which covers damages to the insured for bi caused by uninsured or underinsured motorists 
bi payments are primarily for medical costs and general damages 
the following table represents the typical closure patterns of bi claims in the california automobile insurance coverage of total claims closed dollars paid bi claims closed in the accident year reported to bi claims closed one year after the accident year reported to bi claims closed two years after the accident year reported to bi claims closed three years after the accident year reported to claims that close during the initial accident year reported are generally the smaller  less complex claims that settle  on average  for approximately  to  whereas the average settlement  once all claims are closed in a particular accident year  is approximately  to  the company creates incurred loss triangles to estimate ultimate losses utilizing historical reserving patterns and evaluates the results of this analysis against its frequency and severity analysis to establish bi reserves 
the company adjusts development factors to account for inflation trends it sees in loss severity 
as a larger proportion of claims from an accident year are settled  there becomes a higher degree of certainty for the reserves established for that accident year 
consequently  there is a decreasing likelihood of reserve development on any particular accident year  as those periods age 
the company believes that the accident years that are most likely to develop are the through accident years  however it is also possible that older accident years could develop as well 
in general  when establishing reserves  the company expects that historical trends will continue 
furthermore  the company believes that costs tend to increase  which is generally consistent with historical data  and therefore the company believes that it is more reasonable to expect inflation than deflation 
many potential factors can affect the bi inflation rate  including changes in statutes and regulations  an increase or reduction in litigated files  general economic factors  more timely handling of claims  safer vehicles  changes in weather patterns  and gasoline prices  however  whether these are the factors that actually impacted the bi losses  and the magnitude of that impact is unknown 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the california automobile bi inflation rate could vary from recorded amounts by as much as  and for  and  respectively 
however  the variation could be more or less than these amounts 
as a comparison  at december  the actual variation for the amounts recorded at december  was  and for the  and accident years  respectively 
the following table shows the effects on the  and accident year california bi loss reserves based on possible variations in the severity recorded california bodily injury inflation reserve sensitivity analysis accident year number of claims expected a actual recorded severity at implied inflation rate recorded a pro forma severity if actual severity is lower by for  for and for b pro forma severity if actual severity is higher by for  for and for loss redundancy if actual severity is less than recorded column a loss development if actual severity is more than recorded column b not applicable total loss redundancy development a the recent downward trend in the total number of claims reported is reflective of declining loss frequencies and a decline in the number of insurance policies issued 
during  the company experienced a large increase in the average cost paid on claims that closed within the accident period 
only between and of the claims close in the first year  however the averages are still an indicator that inflation is increasing at a higher rate than in previous recent accident periods 
as a result  the company adjusted inflation rate assumptions upwards for the accident year  as compared to the company is uncertain as to what is driving the larger than normal inflation increases but  as shown in the table above  it is not unusual for the rate to vary from period to period 
claims reported variability claim count development the company generally estimates ultimate claim counts for an accident period based on development of claim counts in prior accident periods 
typically  for california automobile bi claims  the company has experienced that approximately to additional claims will be reported in the year subsequent to an accident year  but such late reported claims could be more or less than the company s expectations 
typically  almost every claim is reported within one year following the end of an accident year and at that point the company has a high degree of certainty as to what the ultimate claim count will be 
the following table shows the number of bi claims reported at the end of the accident period and one year later california bodily injury claim count development table accident year number of claims reported for that accident year as of december of that accident year number of claims reported at december one year later percentage increase in number of claims reported there are many potential factors that can affect the number of claims reported after a period end including changes in weather patterns  a reduction in the amount of litigated files  whether the last day of the year falls on a weekday or a weekend and vehicle safety improvements 
however  the company is unable to determine which  if any  of the factors actually impacted the number of claims reported and  if so  by what magnitude 
at december   there were  bi claims reported for the accident year and the company estimates that these are expected to ultimately grow by to approximately  claims 
the company believes that while actual development in recent years has ranged between roughly and  it is reasonable to expect that the range could be as great as to be between and 
actual development may be more or less than the expected range 
the following table shows the effect should the actual amount of claims reported develop differently within the broader reasonably possible range than what the company recorded at december  california bodily injury claim count reserve sensitivity analysis accident year claims reported amount recorded at at claim count development total expected amount if claim count development is total expected amount if claim count development is claim count approximate average cost per claim not meaningful total dollars not meaningful total loss redundancy development variability between the company s loss experience and industry averages for those lines of business where there is a heavy reliance on industry averages to establish reserves  primarily new jersey bodily injury claims 
new jersey is a no fault state  which means that the majority of medical costs are paid directly by a policyholder s insurance company rather than by the insurance company of the person who was at fault in the accident 
this coverage is known as personal injury protection pip and in new jersey the standard policy has a statutory limit of  per person 
in new jersey  the bi coverage provides compensation for pain and suffering and any out of pocket medical costs not provided by the pip coverage 
the pip limits are very high in new jersey and the bi cases are often more complicated and expensive than in other states  therefore they tend to take longer to settle 
consequently  establishing a reserve for these coverages in new jersey is generally more difficult than in most of the states in which the company operates 
adding to the reserving difficulty is the fact that the company has a very short operating history in new jersey  underwriting personal automobile insurance only since the fall of as a result of the lack of sufficient operating history prior to  the company relied on industry loss data to determine the ultimate losses for the bi and pip coverage s in new jersey 
the reserve approach utilized for new jersey in assumed that there would not be significantly more development on the accident year claims  due to the maturity of those claims  and that the relationship between company loss data and industry loss data in accident years  and will be similar to that experienced in accident year in  it became apparent that the company results were turning out differently than estimates derived by the industry results 
in particular  loss severities for the pip coverage were developing into larger amounts than the industry data suggested 
with the passage of  the loss data began to mature and the company began utilizing its own historical loss patterns to determine the reserves 
while management believes that this has led to a more reliable reserve estimate  there is still a great deal of potential variability in the reserves 
this is particularly true with pip and bi losses which often take years to settle 
at december  the company estimates that in new jersey  for every increase on recorded bi and pip loss severities for the  and accident years  an additional loss reserve of approximately million would be required  with the converse holding true if the loss severities recorded were reduced 
as these accident years continue to mature  there is likely to be additional development  however  it is uncertain whether this development will be positive or negative 
unexpected large individual losses or groups of losses arising from older accident periods typically caused by an event that is not reflected in the historical company data used to establish reserves 
these types of losses are generally not provided for in the current reserve because they are not known or expected and tend to be unquantifiable 
once known  the company establishes a provision for the losses 
consequently  it is not possible to provide any meaningful sensitivity analysis as to the potential size of any unexpected losses 
these losses can be caused by many factors  including unexpected legal interpretations of coverage  ineffective claims handling  regulation extending claims reporting periods  assumption of unexpected or unknown risks  adverse court decisions as well as many unknown factors 
conversely  it is possible to experience positive reserve development when one or more of these factors prove to be beneficial to the company 
one instance when there were large unanticipated losses arising from older accident periods was in from extra contractual losses in florida 
typically  extra contractual claims are those that settle for more than the policy limits because the original claim was denied  thus exposing the company to losses greater than the policy limits 
claims may be denied for various reasons  including material misrepresentations made by the insured on the policy application or insureds that have violated prohibitions in the insurance contract or when there is fraud involved 
these types of losses are fairly infrequent but can amount to millions of dollars per claim  especially if the injured party sustained a serious physical injury 
consequently  these claims can have a large impact on the company s losses 
during  the company had extra contractual losses that settled for amounts much greater than the policy limits and much greater than expected 
as a result of these settlements  the company  during the second quarter of  reevaluated its exposure to extra contractual claims in florida and increased its reserve estimates for prior accident years 
to mitigate this specific risk  during the company established new claims handling and review procedures in florida  as well as in other states  that are intended to reduce the risk of receiving extra contractual claims 
consequently  the company does not expect that florida extra contractual claims will continue to have a significant impact on the financial statements or reserves in the future 
however  it is possible that these procedures will not prove entirely effective and the company may continue to have material extra contractual losses 
it is also possible that the company has not identified and established a sufficient reserve for all of the extra contractual losses occurring in the older accident years  even though a comprehensive claims file review was undertaken  or that the company will experience additional development on these reserves 
discussion of loss reserves and prior period loss development at december  at december  and  the company recorded its point estimate of approximately  million and  million  respectively  in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves which includes approximately and million  respectively  of incurred but not reported ibnr loss reserves 
ibnr includes estimates  based upon past experience  of ultimate developed costs which may differ from case estimates  unreported claims which occurred on or prior to december  and estimated future payments for reopened claims reserves 
management believes that the liability established at december  for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date 
since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provisions 
the company reevaluates its reserves quarterly 
when management determines that the estimated ultimate claim cost requires reduction for previously reported accident years  positive development occurs and a reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period 
if the estimated ultimate claim cost requires an increase for previously reported accident years  negative development occurs and an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period 
for  the company had negative development of approximately million on the and prior accident years loss and loss adjustment expense reserves which at december  totaled approximately  million 
the primary causes of the negative loss development were the estimates for california bodily injury severities and california defense and cost containment reserves established at december  were too low causing adverse development of approximately million 
during the year  the company experienced a lengthening of the pay out period for claims that are settled after the first year and a large increase in the average amounts paid on closed claims 
the company believes that the lengthening of the pay out periods may be attributable to a law passed in california several years ago that extended the statute for filing claims from one year to two years 
initial indications  when the law was passed  were that the law would have little impact on development patterns and therefore it was not factored into the company s reserve estimates 
in hindsight  claims payouts to years after the period end have increased thereby affecting the loss reserve estimates 
the company believes that this trend was factored into its reserve estimate at year end the company had approximately million of adverse development on its new jersey reserves established at december  due to short operating history and rapid growth in that state  the company had limited internal historical claims information to estimate bi  pip and related loss adjustment expense reserves as of december  consequently  the company relied substantially on industry data to help set these reserves 
during  the reserve indications using the company s own historical data rather than industry data led to increases in estimates for both pip losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in particular  loss severities experienced by the company data for the pip coverage developed into amounts larger than industry data suggested 
the company is now using its own historical data  rather than industry data to set new jersey loss reserves 
management believes that  over time this will lead to less variation in reserve estimates

the company s insurance premiums are recognized as income ratably over the term of the policies  that is  in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs and maintenance costs to related unearned premiums  net of investment income 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become substantially unprofitable  a premium deficiency reserve may be required 
the company does not expect this to occur on any of its significant lines of business 
at december   a premium deficiency reserve of  was established for new jersey operations after anticipating investment income 
investments beginning january   all of the company s fixed maturity and equity investments are classified as trading and carried at fair value as required by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 as amended  and sfas no 
prior to january   the company s fixed maturity and equity investment portfolios were classified either as available for sale or trading and carried at fair value under sfas no 
 as amended 
the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
and sfas no 
as of january  equity holdings  including non sinking fund preferred stocks  are  with minor exceptions  actively traded on national exchanges or trading markets  and were valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet date 
changes in fair value of the investments are reflected in net realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations as required under sfas no 
 as amended  and sfas no 
for equity securities  the net loss due to changes in fair value in was approximately of fair value at december  the primary cause of the losses in fair value of equity securities was the overall decline in the stock markets  which saw a decline of approximately in the s p index in the underperformance of the company s equities was primarily due to the large allocation to energy related stocks  which experienced a decline in value more severe than that of the overall stock market 
for fixed maturity securities  the net loss due to changes in fair value was approximately of fair value in the company believes that the primary causes of the majority of the losses in fair value of fixed maturity securities were ongoing downgrades of municipal bond insurers  widening credit spreads  and reduced market liquidity 
fair value of financial instruments certain financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair values of the company s financial instruments are generally based on  or derived from  executable bid prices 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
the company s financial instruments include securities issued by the us government and its agencies  securities issued by states and municipalities  certain corporate and other debt securities  corporate equity securities  and exchange traded funds 
over of the fair value of the financial instruments held at december  is based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or is derived from such prices or parameters 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary across different financial instruments 
observable market prices and pricing parameters in a financial instrument  or a related financial instrument  are used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
certain financial instruments that the company holds or may acquire may lack observable market prices or market parameters currently or in future periods because they are less actively traded 
the fair value of such instruments is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular financial instrument 
these techniques may involve some degree of judgment 
the price transparency of the particular financial instrument will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of financial instrument  whether it is a new financial instrument and not yet established in the marketplace  and the characteristics particular to the transaction 
financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency 
by contrast  financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have diminished price transparency 
even in normally active markets  the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation 
alternatively  in thinly quoted markets  the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a financial instrument provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise is not actively quoted 
for a further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements investments and investment income fair value of investments in income taxes at december   the company s deferred income taxes were in a net asset position  compared to a net liability position at december  the movement to net asset position is due primarily to a decrease in the market value of investment securities 
the company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized and to the extent management believes realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
management s recoverability assessment is based on estimates of anticipated capital gains  available capital gains realized in prior years that could be utilized through carryback and tax planning strategies available to generate future taxable capital gains  which are expected to be sufficient to offset recorded deferred tax assets 
specifically  the company has the ability and intention to generate realized capital gains  and minimize realized capital losses for which no tax benefit will be derived  by employing a combination of prudent planning strategies 
the company expects to hold certain quantities of debt securities  which are currently in loss positions  to recovery or maturity 
management believes unrealized losses related to these debt securities  which represent a significant portion of the unrealized loss positions at year end  are not due to default risk 
thus  the principal amounts are believed to be fully realizable at maturity 
the company has a long term horizon for holding these securities  which management believes will allow avoidance of forced sales prior to maturity 
the company has prior years realized capital gains available to offset realized capital losses  via the filing of carryback refund claims 
the company also has unrealized gains in its investment portfolio which could be realized through asset dispositions  at management s discretion 
further  the company has the capability to generate additional realized capital gains by entering into a sale leaseback transaction using one or more properties of its appreciated real estate holdings 
finally  the company has an established history of generating capital gain premiums earned through its common stock call option program 
based on the continued existence of the options market  the substantial amount of capital committed to supporting the call option program  and the company s favorable track record in generating net capital gains from this program in both upward and downward markets  management believes it will be able to generate sufficient amounts of option premium capital gains more than sufficient to offset any losses on the underlying stocks employed in the program on a consistent  long term basis 
by prudent utilization of some or all of these actions  management believes that it has the ability and intent to generate capital gains  and minimize tax losses  in a manner sufficient to avoid losing the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
management s position is supported based on the company s steady history of generating positive cash flow from operations  as well as its reasonable expectation that its cash flow needs can be met in future periods without the forced sale of its investments 
this capability will enable management to use its discretion in controlling the timing and amount of realized losses it generates during future periods 
thus  although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
contingent liabilities the company has known  and may have unknown  potential liabilities that are evaluated using the criteria established by sfas no 
these include claims  assessments or lawsuits relating to the company s business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them or discloses them in the notes to the consolidated financial statements if they meet the requirements stated in sfas no 
while it is not possible to know with certainty the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities  an unfavorable result may have a material impact on the company s quarterly results of operations  however  it is not expected to be material to the company s financial position

these losses  primarily in fixed maturity securities  arise from the market value declines on the company s holdings during resulting from ongoing downgrades of municipal bond insurers  widening credit spreads  economic downturn impacting municipalities and the lack of liquidity in the market 
the income tax benefit of million in  compared to a tax expense of million in  resulted primarily from realized losses in the investment portfolio 
operating income for was million  down from the prior year largely due to a decrease in premiums earned reflecting the continuing soft market conditions  higher losses as a result of inflation and higher other operating expenses 
in addition  a decrease in net investment income resulting from lower investment yields and lower invested assets contributed to the decrease in operating income 
partially offsetting this was a million net tax benefit realized from the tax case victory over the california ftb 
operating income is a non gaap measure which represents net income excluding realized investment gains and losses  net of tax  and adjustments for other significant non recurring  infrequent or unusual items 
net income is the gaap measure that is most directly comparable to operating income

liquidity and capital resources general the company is largely dependent upon dividends received from its insurance subsidiaries to pay debt service costs and to make distributions to its shareholders 
under current insurance law  the insurance companies are entitled to pay  without extraordinary approval  ordinary dividends of approximately million in extraordinary dividends  as defined by the doi  require doi extraordinary approval 
actual ordinary dividends paid from the insurance companies to mercury general during were million 
as of december   mercury general also had approximately million in investments and cash that could be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations 
the principal sources of funds for the insurance companies are premiums  sales and maturity of invested assets and dividend and interest income from invested assets 
the principal uses of funds for the insurance companies are the payment of claims and related expenses  operating expenses  dividends to mercury general and the purchase of investments 
cash flows the company has generated positive cash flow from operations for over twenty consecutive years 
because of the company s long track record of positive operating cash flows  it does not attempt to match the duration and timing of asset maturities with those of liabilities 
rather  the company manages its portfolio with a view towards maximizing total return with an emphasis on after tax income 
with combined cash and short term investments of million at december   the company believes its cash flow from operations is adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments 
however  the company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs or that the company will not be required to raise additional funds to meet those needs  including future business expansion  through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities with lending institutions 
net cash provided from operating activities in was million  a decrease of million over the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the slowdown in growth of premiums reflecting softening market conditions in personal automobile insurance coupled with an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses paid in compared with the same period in the company has utilized the cash provided from operating activities primarily for the purchase and development of information technology such as the nextgen and mercury first computer systems and the payment of dividends to its shareholders 
funds derived from the sale  redemption or maturity of fixed maturity investments of million  were primarily reinvested by the company in high grade fixed maturity securities 
the following table shows estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities at december  by contractual maturity in the next five years 
fixed maturities amounts in thousands due in one year or less due after one year through two years due after two years through three years due after three years through four years due after four years through five years invested assets an important component of the company s financial results is the return on its investment portfolio 
the company s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
the investment strategy has historically focused on the need for risk adjusted spread to support the underlying liabilities to achieve return on capital and profitable growth 
the company believes that investment spread is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to minimize the effect of downgrades and defaults 
the company believes that this strategy maintains the investment spread necessary to sustain investment income over time 
the company s portfolio management approach utilizes a recognized market risk and asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  liquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements 
within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions

consequently  during  the company recognized approximately million in net realized investment losses  of which  approximately million was related to fixed maturity securities and approximately million was related to equity securities 
included in this loss is million related to the change in fair value of the total investment portfolio 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the change in unrealized gains and losses on all investments are recorded as realized gains and losses on the consolidated statements of operations 
fixed maturity securities fixed maturity securities include debt securities and redeemable preferred stocks 
a primary exposure for the fixed maturity securities is interest rate risk 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
as assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s historical investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
fixed maturity investment made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the modified duration of the fixed maturity securities is years at december  compared to years at december  another exposure related to the fixed maturity securities is credit risk  which is managed by maintaining a minimum average portfolio credit quality rating of aa  unchanged from december  bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically  within the tax exempt sector 
holdings in the taxable sector consist principally of investment grade issues 
as reported for the year ended december   the company had more than of its fixed maturity assets invested in municipal securities with another invested in aaa rated mortgage backed securities and us government bonds 
less than of its fixed maturity securities were invested in corporate securities at december  more than half of the company s municipal securities were insured by companies with aaa ratings 
the majority of mortgage backed securities were collateralized by prime borrowers and had aaa ratings 
uninsured municipal securities had an average credit rating of aa  while insured municipal securities had an underlying average credit rating of aa 
due to the strong underlying credit ratings of the company s municipal securities  the government backing of most of mortgage backed securities  and the relatively small corporate security exposure  the company has been able to maintain a very strong overall credit rating of aa on the fixed maturity portfolio at december  the following table presents the credit quality rating of the company s fixed maturity portfolio by types of security at december  at fair value december  amounts in thousands aaa aa a bbb non rated other total us government bonds and agencies treasuries government agency total municipal securities insured uninsured total mortgage backed securities agencies non agencies prime alt a total corporate securities communications consumer cyclical energy financial gse financial utilities total redeemable preferred stock reverse convertible corporate hybrid cdo redeemable preferred stock total total insured municipal bonds based on underlying ratings aaa  aa  a  bbb  non rated other  municipal securities the company had approximately billion at fair value billion at amortized cost in municipal bonds at december   which comprised approximately of net losses held in the portfolio

based on the uncertainty surrounding the financial condition of these insurers  it is possible that there will be additional downgrades to below investment grade ratings by the rating agencies in the future  and such downgrades could impact the estimated fair value of municipal bonds

in addition  the company has a long term time horizon for its municipal bond holdings which generally allows it to recover the full principle amounts upon maturity  avoiding forced sales  prior to maturity  of bonds that have declined in market value due to the bond insurers rating downgrades 
at december   municipal securities include auction rate securities 
the company owned million and million at fair value of adjustable rate short term securities  including auction rate securities  at december  and  respectively 
mortgage backed securities the entire mortgage backed securities portfolio is categorized as loans to prime borrowers except for approximately million million amortized cost of alt a mortgages at december  alt a mortgage backed securities are at fixed or variable rates and include certain securities that are collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to borrowers with stronger credit profiles than sub prime borrowers  but do not qualify for prime financing terms due to high loan to value ratios or limited supporting documentation 
the average rating of the company s alt a mortgages is aa and the average rating of the entire mortgage backed securities portfolio is aaa 
the valuation of these securities is based on level inputs that can be observed in the market

the acquisition was financed by a million credit facility 
the loan matures on january  with interest payable quarterly at an annual floating rate of libor rate plus basis points 
in addition  the company may be required to pay up to million over the next two years as additional consideration for the ais acquisition 
the company plans to fund that portion of the purchase price  if necessary  from cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
on february   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its floating libor rate plus basis points on the loan for a fixed rate of 
the swap is not designated as a hedge

contractual obligations the company has obligations to make future payments under contracts and credit related financial instruments and commitments 
at december   certain long term aggregate contractual obligations and credit related commitments are summarized as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter amounts in thousands debt including interest lease obligations losses and loss adjustment expenses contingent consideration total contractual obligations based on the projected performance of the ais business  the company does not expect to pay the contingent consideration over the two years 
notes to contractual obligations table the interest included in the company s debt obligations was calculated using the fixed rates of on million of senior notes  under an million credit facility  and under a million credit facility 
the company is party to an interest rate swap of its fixed rate on million of senior notes for a floating rate of six month libor plus basis points 
using the actual effective annual interest rate of for the remaining term of million of senior notes  the total contractual obligations would be approximately million lower than the total debt contractual obligations stated above 
the company s outstanding debt contains various terms  conditions and covenants which  if violated by the company  would result in a default and could result in the acceleration of the company s payment obligations thereunder 
unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and loss adjustment expenses do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and loss adjustment expense payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates

regulatory capital requirement the naic utilizes a risk based capital formula for casualty insurance companies which establishes recommended minimum capital requirements that are compared to the company s actual capital level 
the formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements and a number of other factors 
the company has calculated the risk based capital requirements of each of the insurance companies as of december  the policyholders statutory surplus of each of the insurance companies exceeded the highest level of minimum required capital 
industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all the insurance companies of  million at december   and net premiums written of  million  the ratio of premium writings to surplus was to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures 
primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates  equity prices and credit risk 
adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in the liquidity of a market  or to changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness and risk tolerance 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
overview the company s investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks  including accountability and controls over risk management activities  and specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary 
executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through the investment committee 
the investment committee focuses on strategies to enhance yields  mitigate market risks and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns 
the company manages exposures to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration  credit ratings  and value at risk limits 
asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
duration limits on the fixed maturities portfolio place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
value at risk limits are intended to restrict the potential loss in fair value that could arise from adverse movements in the fixed maturities and equity markets based on historical volatilities and correlations among market risk factors 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
this risk arises from many of its primary activities  as the company invests substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and issues interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in us treasury yields and other key benchmarks as well as changes in interest rates resulting from the widening credit spreads and credit exposure to collateralized securities 
the company invests its assets primarily in fixed maturity investments  which at december  comprised approximately of total investments at fair value 
tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity investments with the remaining amount consisting of sinking fund preferred stocks and taxable bonds 
equity securities account for approximately of total investments at fair value 
the remaining of the investment portfolio consists of highly liquid short term investments which are primarily short term money market funds 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases and vice versa 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that utilizes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal towards maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s historical investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the increase in municipal bond credit spreads in caused the overall market interest rate to increase  which resulted in the increase in the duration of the company s portfolio 
consequently  the modified duration of the bond portfolio is years at december  compared to years and years at december  and  respectively 
given a hypothetical parallel increase of basis or basis points in interest rates  the fair value of the bond portfolio at december  would decrease by approximately million or million  respectively 
effective january   the company entered into an interest rate swap of its fixed rate obligation on its million fixed rate senior notes for a floating rate 
the interest rate swap has the effect of hedging the fair value of the senior notes 
equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that the company will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the equity markets 
at december   the company s primary objective for common equity investments is current income 
the fair value of the equity investment consists of million in common stocks and million in non sinking fund preferred stocks
