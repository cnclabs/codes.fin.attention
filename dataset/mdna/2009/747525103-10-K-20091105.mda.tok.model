item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent developments revenues for fiscal were billion  with net income of billion  which were impacted by the following key items both revenues and net income were adversely impacted by lower demand for cdma based msm integrated circuits during the first half of fiscal as a result of the slowdown in the global economy 
we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for cdma based wireless devices  a decrease of  compared to approximately million msm integrated circuits in fiscal in addition  net income was adversely impacted by other than temporary losses on marketable securities related primarily to the volatility in global financial markets 
cdma based device shipments totaled approximately million units  an increase of over the million units shipped in fiscal the average selling price of cdma based devices was estimated to be approximately  a decrease of approximately from the prior year 
we entered into a settlement and patent license and non assert agreement with broadcom corporation 
as a result of this agreement  we recorded a million charge 
in july  the korea fair trade commission kftc announced although a written decision has not yet been issued that it found us to be in violation of south korean law by offering certain discounts and rebates for purchases of our cdma chips and that it would levy a fine  as well as order us to cease the practices at issue 
we intend to appeal the written decision once issued 
as a result of this announcement  we recorded a million charge 
against this backdrop  the following recent developments occurred during fiscal with respect to key elements of our business or our industry worldwide wireless subscribers grew by approximately to reach approximately billion 
cdma subscribers  including both g cdmaone and g cdma x  xev do  wcdma  hspa and td scdma  are approximately of total worldwide wireless subscribers to date 
g subscribers all cdma based grew to approximately million worldwide including approximately million cdma x xev do subscribers and approximately million wcdma hspa td scdma subscribers 
in the handset market  cdma based unit shipments grew an estimated year over year  compared to an estimated decline of year over year across all technologies 
in september  the japan fair trade commission jftc issued a cease and desist order cdo seeking to require us to modify our existing license agreements with japanese companies to eliminate certain cross license non assertion provisions in our license agreements  while preserving the license of our patents to those companies 
we intend to invoke our right under japanese law to an administrative hearing before the jftc and to seek a stay of the cdo from the jftc  and if necessary  from the japanese courts 
according to wireless intelligence estimates as of november   for the quarter ending september  wireless intelligence estimates for cdma x xev do subscribers do not include wireless local loop 
derived from reports provided by our licensees manufacturers during the year and our own estimates of unreported activity 
based on current reports by strategy analytics  a global research and consulting firm  in their global handset market share updates 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture  have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our cdma technology and other technologies 
we derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products  license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property  messaging and 
table of contents other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing and related services  software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we conduct business primarily through four reportable segments 
these segments are qualcomm cdma technologies  or qct  qualcomm technology licensing  or qtl  qualcomm wireless internet  or qwi  and qualcomm strategic initiatives  or qsi 
qct is a leading developer and supplier of cdma based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications  multimedia functions and global positioning system products 
qct s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices  particularly mobile phones  laptops  data modules  handheld wireless computers  data cards and infrastructure equipment

qct s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling equipment manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits 
the infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband cdma modem functionality in the wireless operator s base station equipment 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qct utilizes a fabless production business model  which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made 
integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test manufacturing processes 
we rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly  and most of the testing  of our integrated circuits 
our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits 
we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits 
turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits 
under the two stage manufacturing business model  we purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third party manufacturers for back end assembly and test services 
we refer to this two stage manufacturing business model as integrated fabless manufacturing ifm 
qtl grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdmaone  cdma  wcdma  cdma tdd including td scdma  gsm gprs edge and or ofdma standards and their derivatives 
qtl receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property 
license fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments 
ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed products  net of certain permissible deductions eg  certain shipping costs  packing costs  vat  etc qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the vast majority of such revenues have been generated through our licensees sales of cdmaone  cdma and wcdma products 
qwi  which includes qualcomm enterprise services qes  qualcomm internet services qis  qualcomm government technologies qgov and firethorn  generates revenues primarily through mobile information products and services  software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications 
qes sells equipment  software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets and workforce 
through september  qes has shipped approximately  terrestrial based and satellite based mobile information units 
qis provides content enablement services for the wireless industry  including brew binary runtime environment for wireless  the plaza suite and other services 
qis also provides qchat push to talk  qpoint and other products for wireless network operators 
the qgov division provides development  hardware and analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to united states government agencies 
firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable financial institutions and wireless operators to offer mobile commerce services 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi manages the company s strategic investment activities  including flo tv incorporated flo tv  formerly mediaflo usa  inc  our wholly owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary 
qsi also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of cdma based products and services 
our strategy is to invest in early stage and other companies  including licensed device manufacturers  that we believe open new markets for cdma technology  support the design and introduction of new cdma based products or possess 
table of contents unique capabilities or technology 
our flo tv subsidiary offers its service over our nationwide multicasting network based on our mediaflo media distribution system mds and mediaflo technology 
this network is utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the united states 
the commercial availability of the flo tv service to retail wireless consumers continues to be determined  in part  by our wireless operator partners 
flo tv s network uses the mhz spectrum for which we hold licenses nationwide 
additionally  flo tv has and will continue to procure  aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will continue to make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers whether they operate on cdma  wcdma or gsm networks in the united states 
distribution  marketing  billing and customer care remain functions that are provided primarily by our wireless operator partners 
as part of our strategic investment activities  we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future  which may include distribution of our ownership interest in flo tv to our stockholders in a spin off transaction 
nonreportable segments include the qualcomm mems technologies division  which is developing an interferometric modulator imod display technology based on micro electro mechanical system mems structure combined with thin film optics  the qualcomm flarion technologies division  which is developing femtocell chipset products and other ofdm ofdma technologies  the mediaflo technologies division  which is developing our mediaflo mds and mediaflo technology and markets mediaflo for deployment outside of the united states  and other product initiatives 
looking forward the deployment of g networks enables increased voice capacity and higher data rates  thereby supporting more minutes of use and a range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets  g connected computing devices and other consumer electronics 
data applications include broadband connectivity  streaming video  location based services  mobile social networking and multimedia messaging 
as a result  we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for g products and services around the world 
as we look forward to the next several months  the following items are likely to have an impact on our business the network launches and further expansion of g in china  including cdma by china telecom  wcdma by china unicom and td scdma by china mobile  is expected to drive competition and growth of g products and services in that region 
the transition to g cdma based networks is expected to continue o more than operators have commercially launched g networks  including cdma networks and wcdma networks  o more than cdma operators have commercially launched the higher data speeds of xev do and more than have launched ev do revision a  and o more than wcdma operators have commercially launched the higher data speeds of hsdpa  while more than have launched hsupa and have launched hspa 
we expect that cdma based device prices will continue to segment into high and low end due to high volumes and vibrant competition in marketplaces around the world 
as operators deploy the higher data speeds of hspa  hspa  ev do revision a and ev do revision b and as manufacturers introduce additional highly featured  converged devices  we expect consumer demand for advanced g devices to continue at a strong pace 
to meet growing demand for advanced g wireless devices and increased multimedia functionality  we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward the development of wireless baseband chips  converged computing communication chips  multimedia products  software and services for the wireless industry 
we expect that a portion of our research and development initiatives in fiscal will not reach commercialization until several years in the future 
we expect demand for cost effective wireless devices to continue to grow and have developed a family of qualcomm single chip qsc products  which integrate the baseband  radio frequency and power management functions into a single chip or package  lowering component counts and enabling faster time to market for our customers 
while we continue to invest aggressively to expand our qsc product family to address the low end market more effectively with cdma based products  we still face significant competition from gsm based products  particularly in emerging markets 
we expect to continue to invest in the evolution of cdma and a broad range of other technologies as part of our vision to enable a range of technologies  including the following products and technologies 
table of contents o the continued evolution of cdma based technologies  including the long term roadmaps of xev do and high speed packet access hspa  o ofdm and ofdma based technologies  including lte  o our service applications platform  content delivery services and user interfaces  o our snapdragon platform to help create new cdma based connected computing products and drive connectivity beyond traditional wireless devices  o our gobi mobile data modems to provide worldwide cdma based embedded connectivity for existing computing platforms  o our convergence based chips that include g modem and applications processor capabilities including support for third party operating systems  o our flo tv mobile television service which includes product and distribution expansion beyond wireless operators through direct to consumer products such as automotive devices and personal television devices through retail channels  and o our imod display technology 
in addition to the foregoing business and market based matters  the following items are likely to have an impact on our business and results of operations over the next several months we expect to continue to devote resources to working with and educating all participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market 
however  we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new  highly cost effective competitors to their products 
we expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world 
for example  we expect that we will continue to be involved in litigation  and to appear in front of administrative and regulatory bodies  including the european commission  the korea fair trade commission and the japan fair trade commission  to defend our business model and to rebuff efforts by companies seeking to gain competitive advantage or negotiating leverage 
we have been and will continue evaluating and providing reasonable assistance to our customers 
this includes  in some cases  certain levels of financial support to minimize the impact of litigation in which we or our customers may become involved 
the volatility in financial markets may continue to have an impact on the value of our marketable securities and net investment income loss 
according to public reports made available at www 
cdg 
org as of october  as reported by the global mobile suppliers association  an international organization of wcdma and gsm global system for mobile communications suppliers  in their october reports 
further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the risk factors included in this annual report 
revenue concentrations revenues from customers in south korea  china and japan comprised  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues for fiscal  as compared to  and  respectively  for fiscal  and  and  respectively  for fiscal we distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products  software or services are delivered and  for qtl s licensing and royalty revenues  the invoiced addresses of our licensees 
the decline in revenues from customers in japan was primarily due to lower replacement rates in japan 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  share based payments  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions 
table of contents that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  royalties and license fees for our intellectual property  messaging and other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing and related services  software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but actual results may differ from our estimates 
we record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs  including special pricing agreements and other volume related rebate programs 
such reductions to revenue are based on estimates  including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes  market share and inventory levels 
we license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products 
licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee  typically five to fifteen years 
we earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees sales occur 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
we recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
from time to time  licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes  and when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
we also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions 
as of september   our goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were billion and billion  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
for intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non monetary exchange  the estimated fair values of the assets received or  for non monetary exchanges  the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded values  except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value 
an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions which require significant judgment 
for example  the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows  total addressable market  pricing and share forecasts  competition  technology obsolescence  future tax rates and discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of certain assets  or our conclusion that the value of certain assets is not reliably estimable  may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models 
new information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use  including estimates of future cash flows  volumes  market penetration and discount rates  are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our net investment income loss 

table of contents we hold minority investments in publicly traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile 
we also hold investments in other marketable securities  including non investment grade debt securities  equity and debt mutual and exchange traded funds  corporate bonds and notes  auction rate securities and mortgage and asset backed securities 
these investments  which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders equity as other comprehensive income or loss  totaled billion at september  we record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
in addition  the fair values of our strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring impairment charges 
when assessing these investments for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost  the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class  negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others  the performance and pricing of the investee s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations  as applicable 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
if we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary  we may record an impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net other than temporary losses on our investments in marketable securities 
share based payments 
we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six month offering period under our employee stock purchase plan 
share based compensation expense recognized during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
at september   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options granted prior to that date was billion  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
net stock options  after forfeitures and cancellations  granted during fiscal represented of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal period 
total stock options granted during fiscal represented of outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial option pricing model binomial model 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because valuation model assumptions are subjective  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation awards 
there is not currently a generally accepted market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
although we estimate the fair value of employee share based awards  the option pricing model we use may not produce a value that is indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal  we used the implied volatility of market traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model 
we utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two years  and we used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years 
the weighted average volatility assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
the authoritative guidance includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be considered in estimating expected volatility 
we believe implied volatility is more useful than historical volatility in estimating expected 
table of contents volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield curve of us treasury strip securities for a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant 
the weighted average risk free interest rate assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
we do not target a specific dividend yield for our policy on dividend payments  but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the dividend yield assumption was for fiscal  which if decreased to would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
dividends and or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to approval by our board of directors as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance  stock repurchase programs  mergers and acquisitions  and other sources and uses of cash 
while our historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future  it may be subject to substantial change  and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash distributions that will be made to investors 
the post vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information 
the weighted average post vesting forfeiture rate assumption was for fiscal  which if decreased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share  or 
the suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information 
the weighted average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was for fiscal  which if increased to  would increase the weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal by per share or 
income taxes 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
for example  during fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  adjusting our prior year estimates of uncertain tax positions as a result of various federal  state and foreign tax audits 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
as of september   gross deferred tax assets were billion 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
as of september   we had gross deferred tax assets of million related to capital losses and million related to foreign and state net operating losses 
we can only use realized capital losses to offset realized capital gains 
based upon our assessments of when capital gains and losses will be realized  we estimate that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all of the temporary and other than temporary capital losses that were recorded through fiscal during fiscal  we decreased our valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize by million to million 
this decrease was comprised of a million net decrease in valuation allowance as a result of an increase in net unrealized gains on marketable securities  which was recorded as an increase in other comprehensive income  partially offset by a million net increase in valuation allowance related to other than temporary impairments on investments  which was recognized 
table of contents in earnings 
we can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions 
based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities  we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a million valuation allowance for these net operating losses 
significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains  the timing of realization of capital losses and the amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses  capital gains and taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made 
we consider the operating earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately billion related to the united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the united states 
should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results  liquidity or financial position  we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
other than amounts relating to the korea fair trade commission complaint  we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with any other legal proceedings based on our belief that additional liabilities  while possible  are not probable 
further  any possible range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
total revenues for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal revenues from two customers of our qct and qtl segments each of whom accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for the period comprised approximately and in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal the decrease in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a million reduction in revenues from sales of integrated circuit products  mostly consisting of msm and accompanying rf and pm integrated circuits  caused by the contraction in cdma based channel inventory  and a million decrease in qes revenues 
revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal were billion  compared to billion for fiscal the decrease in revenues from licensing and royalty fees was primarily due to a million decrease in brew licensing revenues resulting from lower consumer demand and lower prices due to the slowdown in global economies and competitive pricing pressures 
cost of equipment and services 
cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal was billion compared to billion for fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was for fiscal  compared to for fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues included million in share based compensation in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided  competitive pricing  new product introduction costs and other factors 

table of contents research and development expenses 
for fiscal  research and development expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products  next generation cdma and ofdma technologies  the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services  including lower cost devices  the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing  the convergence of multiband  multimode  multinetwork products and technologies  third party operating systems and services platforms 
the technologies supporting these initiatives may include cdma x  xev do  ev do revision a  ev do revision b  x advanced  wcdma  hsdpa  hsupa  hspa and lte 
research and development expenses in fiscal included share based compensation and in process research and development of million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were billion or of revenues  compared to billion or of revenues for fiscal the dollar decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in professional fees  of which million related to litigation and other legal matters  a million decrease in selling and marketing expenses and a million decrease in travel expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal net investment loss income 
net investment loss was million for fiscal  compared to net investment income of million for fiscal the net decrease was primarily comprised as follows in millions year ended september  september  change interest and dividend income corporate and other segments qsi interest expense net realized gains on investments corporate and other segments qsi net impairment losses on investments corporate and other segments qsi gains on derivative instruments equity in losses earnings of investees net other than temporary losses on marketable securities related primarily to depressed securities values caused by the prolonged disruption in global financial markets affecting consumers and the banking  finance and housing industries 
this disruption is evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion at september   an increase of billion from september  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  consisted of billion held domestically with the remaining balance of billion held by foreign subsidiaries 
due to tax considerations  we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically 
total cash provided by operating activities increased to billion during fiscal  compared to billion during fiscal primarily due to collection of a billion licensing receivable paid in october during fiscal  we repurchased and retired  shares of our common stock for million 
at september   approximately billion remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program

since september  there has been a prolonged disruption in global financial markets that has contributed to a major crisis in debt and equity capital markets and a global economic recession 
this period of economic weakness has impacted the value of our marketable securities 
at september   gross unrealized gains on marketable securities were million and gross unrealized losses were million 
at september   we concluded that the unrealized losses were temporary 
our relative weighting of these factors is reassessed when market or economic conditions change 
further  for equity securities  equity mutual and exchange traded funds and debt mutual funds with unrealized losses  we have the ability and the intent to hold such securities until they recover  which is expected to be within a reasonable period of time 
for debt securities with unrealized losses  we do not have the intent to sell  nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell  such securities 
as a result  we do not believe the decline in the fair value of our marketable securities will materially affect our liquidity 
accounts receivable decreased by during fiscal primarily due to collection of a billion licensing receivable  partial payment of amounts receivable for redemptions of money market funds and reclassification of the remaining net balance of these investment receivables to other assets  and a decrease of approximately million in other accounts receivable 
days sales outstanding related to these other accounts receivable were days at september  compared to days at september  the decrease in other trade accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were primarily due to the timing of cash receipts related to sales of integrated circuits

future accounting requirements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations  which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the guidance will be effective for our fiscal beginning september  and will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis 
the fasb issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements in september  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements

table of contents assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  including goodwill  wireless licenses  other intangible and long lived assets  guarantees and asset retirement obligations 
the adoption of this guidance in fiscal on such nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb ratified the final consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf that revised the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit market risk 
since september  there has been a prolonged disruption in global financial markets that has led to a major crisis in debt and equity capital markets and a global economic recession 
this period of economic weakness has impacted the value of most types of investment and non investment grade bonds and debt obligations and mortgage and asset backed securities 
at september   we held a significant portion of our corporate cash in diversified portfolios of fixed and floating rate  investment grade marketable securities  mortgage and asset backed securities  non investment grade bank loans and bonds  preferred stocks and other securities that have been affected by these credit market concerns and had temporary gross unrealized losses of million 
although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary  there is a risk that we may incur net other than temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these and other similarly affected securities if us credit and equity markets do not stabilize and recover to previous levels in the coming quarters 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a number of diversified investment and non investment grade fixed and floating rate securities  consisting of cash equivalents  marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds 
we deposit our cash primarily with one major institution 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest bearing securities 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed interest bearing securities could lose value 
as interest rates in the general economy have dropped significantly over the past several months  our floating interest bearing securities are earning less interest income 
when the general economy weakens significantly  as it has recently  the credit profile  financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate  and our interest bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
the following table provides information about our interest bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity average interest rates dollars in millions no single thereafter maturity total fixed interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate floating interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate available for sale securities investment grade interest rate non investment grade interest rate cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
equity price risk 
the prolonged disruption in global financial markets has caused increased volatility in the fair values of our equity securities and equity mutual and exchange traded fund shares 
we have a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equities held by mutual and exchange traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk 
we have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size  style  industry and geography  and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares at september  would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of million 
at september   gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange traded fund shares were approximately million 
foreign exchange risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties 
such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   we had a net liability of million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of cdma and wcdma products 
counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions 
in the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments  we may be unable to settle transactions  which could materially impact our results 
if our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in each of our hedged foreign currencies  we would incur a loss of approximately million resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies
