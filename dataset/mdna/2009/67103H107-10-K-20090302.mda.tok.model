overview we are one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts  tools  supplies  equipment and accessories in the united states  selling our products to both do it yourself diy customers and professional installers 
our stores carry an extensive product line consisting of new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items and accessories and a complete line of auto body paint and related materials  automotive tools and professional installer service equipment 
on july   we completed the acquisition of csk  one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest such retailers in the united states  based on store count 
at the date of the acquisition  csk had  stores in states  operating under four brand names checker auto parts  schuck s auto supply  kragen auto parts and murray s discount auto parts 
we view the following factors to be the key drivers of current and future demand for the products we sell number of miles driven and number of registered vehicles the total number of miles driven in the us heavily influences the demand for the repair and maintenance products we sell 
the long term trend in the number of vehicles on the road and the total miles driven in the us has exhibited steady growth over the past decade 
since  the total number of miles driven in the united states has increased at an annual rate of approximately 
the total number of vehicles on the road has increased from million registered light vehicles in to million in total number of miles driven remained relatively unchanged in and declined by in  as many consumers responded to rising fuel prices and other economic constraints in part by curtailing automobile usage 
we believe that the decrease in miles driven in and expected decrease in is a short term trend and that long term miles driven will increase in the future because of the increasing number of vehicles on the road 
average vehicle age changes in the average age of vehicles on the road impacts demand for automotive aftermarket products 
as the average age of a vehicle increases  the vehicle goes through more routine maintenance cycles requiring replacement parts such as brakes  belts  hoses  batteries  and filters 
the sales of these products are a key component of our business 
the average age of the vehicle population has increased over the past decade from years for passenger cars and years for light trucks in to and years  respectively  in based on the dramatic decrease in the sale of new cars and light trucks in  and the expected decrease in  we expect that consumers will continue to choose to keep their vehicles longer and drive them at higher mileages and that this increasing trend in average vehicle age will continue 
unperformed maintenance according to estimates compiled by the automotive aftermarket industry association  the annual amount of unperformed or underperformed maintenance in the united states totaled billion for this metric represents the degree to which routine vehicle maintenance recommended by the manufacturer is not being performed 
consumer decisions to avoid or defer maintenance affect demand for our products and the total amount of unperformed maintenance represents potential future demand 
we believe that challenging macroeconomic conditions in and contributed to the amount of unperformed maintenance 
product quality differentiation we provide our customers with an assortment of products that are differentiated by quality and price for most of the product lines we offer 
for many of our product offerings  this quality differentiation reflects good  better  and best alternatives 
our sales and total gross margin dollars are highest for the best quality category of products 
consumers willingness to select products at a higher point on the value spectrum is a driver of sales and profitability in our industry 
we believe that the average consumer s tendency has been to trade down to lower quality products during the recent challenging economic conditions 
we have ongoing initiatives targeted to marketing higher quality products to our customers and expect our customers to be more willing to return to purchasing up on the value spectrum in the future 
recent developments on july   we completed the acquisition of csk  one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts and accessories in the western united states and one of the largest such retailers in the united states  based on store count 
pursuant to the merger agreement  each share of csk common stock outstanding immediately prior to the merger was canceled and converted into the right to receive of a share of o reilly common stock and in cash 
to fund the transaction  we entered into a credit agreement for a billion asset based revolving credit facility arranged by bank of america  na  which we used to refinance debt  fund the cash portion of the acquisition  pay for other transaction related expenses and provide liquidity for our combined company going forward 
the results of csk s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
at the date of the acquisition  csk had  stores in states  operating under four brand names checker auto parts  schuck s auto supply  kragen auto parts and murray s discount auto parts 
this added stores in twelve new states alaska  arizona  california  colorado  hawaii  idaho  michigan  nevada  new mexico  oregon  utah and washington  and a number of new markets in states where o reilly had a presence prior to the acquisition 
as of december   we had converted csk stores to o reilly brands  merged csk stores with existing o reilly locations  closed six csk stores and opened four new csk stores 
results of operations the following table sets forth  certain income statement data as a percentage of sales for the years indicated years ended december  sales cost of goods sold  including warehouse and distribution expenses gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income debt prepayment costs interim facility commitment fee interest expense interest income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to sales increased billion  or  from billion in to billion in  due to the acquisition of  csk stores and the addition of net new o reilly stores opened during the following table presents the components of the increase in sales for the year ended december  increase decrease in sales for the year ended december  compared to the same period in in millions o reilly stores comparable store sales stores opened throughout  excluding sales for stores open at least one year that are included in that are included in comparable store sales sales of stores opened in non store sales including machinery  sales to independent parts stores and team members csk stores total increase in sales we believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores is the result of superior inventory availability  a broader selection of products in most stores  targeted promotional and advertising efforts through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and layout of stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers 
consolidated comparable store sales for stores open at least one year increased for the year ended december  this increase in was less than the prior year s increase of and historical trends primarily due to challenging external macroeconomic factors in as well as a decline in comparable store sales in the stores added in the csk acquisition 
the external macroeconomic factors which we believe negatively impacted our sales were constraints on our customers discretionary income resulting from inflation  declining home and investment asset values  higher gas prices in early  increased unemployment and the impact of a contraction in the us economy 
comparable store sales for o reilly stores  including csk stores after conversion to the o reilly brand  but excluding the acquired  yet to be converted csk stores  increased for the year ended december  comparable store sales for acquired csk stores open at least one year decreased for the portion of those stores sales since the july  acquisition by o reilly as compared to the same period in when csk s sales were not included in our consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future 
we expect future sales growth as the csk stores are converted to the o reilly dual market strategy 
comparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales of stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery  sales to independent parts stores and sales to team members 
the following table presents quarterly results for non store sales that are excluded from the calculation of comparable stores sales in millions for the quarter ended march june september december for the year ended december gross profit increased million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in the increase in gross profit dollars was primarily the result of the increase in sales resulting from the acquisition of csk  the increase from new stores and increased sales levels at existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is the result of improved product mix  lower product acquisition cost and distribution system improvements 
we improved our product mix by continuing to implement strategies to differentiate our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution 
additionally  gross margin percentage improved as a result of the inclusion of sales from stores acquired in the acquisition of csk 
gross margin percentages on the sales at these stores are higher than existing o reilly stores primarily because a greater proportion of these sales are made to diy customers which typically have higher gross margin percentages and because of market conditions  primarily overall price levels  that are specific to the markets in which the acquired stores are located 
product acquisition costs improved due to increased production by our suppliers in lower cost foreign countries and improved negotiating leverage with our vendors as a result of our significant growth 
improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies 
we anticipate these trends to continue at a moderate rate in  with more significant improvements resulting from continued product acquisition cost reductions relating to the csk acquisition 
sg a increased million  or  from million of sales in to billion of sales in the dollar increase in sg a expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of csk and from additional team members and resources to support our increased store count 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the addition of the csk store base which has a higher expense structure than the core o reilly store base  a one time charge of million to align csk s vacation policy with the company s policy  million of non cash amortization of csk trade names and trade marks and partial de leverage of fixed sg a expenses on low comparable store sales increases 
interest expense increased million  from million or of sales in to million or of sales in the increase in interest expense is the result of borrowings under our new asset based revolving credit facility that were used to fund the csk acquisition as well as amortization of a portion of the debt issuance costs 
other one time charges were incurred in of million for interim financing facility commitment fees related to the csk acquisition and million of debt prepayment costs resulting from the payoff of our existing senior notes and synthetic lease facility 
our provision for income taxes increased from million in effective tax rate to million in effective tax rate 
the increase in effective tax rate is the result of our acquisition of csk and the generally higher effective tax rates in most states where the acquired csk stores are located 
the increase is also attributable to a one time charge to adjust tax liabilities in the amount million relating to the acquisition 
as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income decreased million from million in of sales to million in of sales 
diluted earnings per share decreased per share in to per share on million diluted shares outstanding from per share in on million diluted shares outstanding 
the increase in dilutive shares outstanding is principally the result of shares exchanged in the acquisition of csk 
compared to sales increased million  or  from billion in to billion in  due to net additional stores opened during which contributed million to the sales increase  a full year of sales for stores opened throughout adding million and a increase in same store sales for stores open at least one year providing million of the sales increase 
we believe that the increased sales achieved by our existing stores are the result of superior inventory availability  offering a broader selection of products in most stores  an increased promotional and advertising effort through a variety of media and localized promotional events  continued improvement in the merchandising and store layouts of most stores  compensation programs for all store team members that provide incentives for performance and our continued focus on serving professional installers 
the same store sales increase in of was greater than the prior year s increase of  but below our historical results 
the decrease from historical trends is the result of challenging external macroeconomic factors in and the external macroeconomic factors  which we believe negatively impacted our sales  were constraints on our customers discretionary income as a result of increased interest rates and higher energy costs 
consumers also encountered higher gas prices  which resulted in annual miles driven  a key driver of demand for our products  remaining flat in comparison to the long term trend of annual increases 
we anticipate that continued store unit and sales growth consistent with our historical rates will continue in the future 
increase in sales for the year ended december  compared to the same period in in millions o reilly stores comparable store sales stores opened throughout  excluding stores open at least one year that are included in comparable store sales sales of stores opened in non store sales including machinery  sales to independent parts stores and team members total increase in sales gross profit increased million  or  from billion of sales in to billion of sales in  primarily due to the increase in sales resulting from a larger number of stores and increased sales levels at existing stores 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales is the result of improvements in product mix  lower product acquisition cost and distribution system efficiencies 
improvements in product mix were the result of strategies which differentiated our merchandise selections at each store based on customer demand and vehicle demographics in the store s market and through ongoing team member training initiatives focused on selling products with greater gross margin contribution 
product acquisition cost improved due to increased imports from lower cost providers in foreign countries as well as improved negotiating leverage with our vendors resulting from our increased purchasing power 
improvements in our distribution system were the result of capital projects designed to create operating expense efficiencies 
we anticipate these trends to continue at a moderate rate throughout sg a increased million  or  from million of sales in to million of sales in the increase in these expenses was primarily attributable to increased salaries and benefits  rent and other costs associated with the addition of employees and facilities to support the increased level of our operations 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales was the result of increased store salaries primarily driven by the timing of new store openings  higher advertising costs  increased depreciation expense primarily driven by investment in new store technology and increased stock compensation expense 
other income  net  increased by million from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to decreased interest expense on long term debt resulting from a reduction in the interest rate on long term debt as well as increased interest income derived from a higher than average cash balance 
provision for income taxes increased from million in effective tax rate to million in effective tax rate 
the increase in the dollar amount was due to the increase of income before income taxes 
as a result of the impacts discussed above  net income increased million from million in of sales to million in of sales 
diluted earnings per share increased per share in to per share on million diluted shares outstanding from per share in in million diluted shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities in was consistent with the cash provided by operating activities in principally because an increase in net inventory investment in was offset by an increase in operating income adjusted for non cash depreciation and amortization expenses  and a one time non cash charge of million to align  where possible  csk s vacation policy with the company s policy 
net inventory investment reflects our investment in inventory net of the amount of accounts payable to vendors 
the increase in net inventory investment in was the result of investments made to improve the inventory availability in the stores acquired in the acquisition of csk 
the average per store inventory for core o reilly stores increased to  as of december   from  as of december  csk store s average per store inventory increased from  at the date of acquisition  to  as of december  the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in was due to increased net income and a reduction in net inventory investment 
the reduction in net inventory investment is the result of reductions in our per store inventory levels and our ongoing effort to extend terms with our vendors 
reductions in our per store inventory levels are driven by our continued optimization of inventory selection at our stores and our ability to efficiently deploy inventory throughout our distribution network 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash used in investing activities in was principally due to an increase in capital expenditures and payments made in association with the acquisition of csk 
capital expenditures were million in  million in and million in the increase in capital expenditures in was the result of the july  purchase of properties previously leased under our synthetic lease facility in conjunction with the financing of the acquisition of csk  the addition of a distribution center facility in lubbock  texas  cash paid in the construction of a distribution center in greensboro  north carolina planned to open in and capital investments made in the initial stage of our integration of the operations of csk 
the increase in capital expenditures from these items was partially offset by decreased capital expenditures for new store construction 
we opened  and net stores in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in compared to was due to increases in capital expenditures resulting from our increased number of new stores  store relocations  enhancements in existing store technology and the purchase of million of csk shares 
these expenditures were primarily related to the opening of new stores and distribution centers  as well as the relocation or remodeling of existing stores 
our plan for the integration of the csk acquisition and our continuing store expansion program will require significant capital expenditures and working capital investments in total capital expenditures in are expected to range from million to million 
the csk integration plan will require capital expenditures for the planned addition of facilities to enhance distribution infrastructure and the conversion of acquired stores to the o reilly brand 
costs associated with the conversion of csk stores include investments in store computer systems  signage  fixtures  interior and exterior renovation  and delivery vehicles 
the estimated conversion cost per store is expected to be approximately  additionally  our growth plans call for approximately new stores and the addition of a distribution center in greensboro  north carolina 
the costs associated with the opening of a new store including the cost of land acquisition  improvements  fixtures  net inventory investment and computer equipment are estimated to average approximately million to million  however  such costs may be significantly reduced where we lease  rather than purchase  the store site 
we plan to finance our expansion program through cash expected to be provided from operating activities and available borrowings under our abl credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided by financing activities in is primarily the result of the proceeds from borrowings under our asset based credit facility partially offset by the payment of outstanding principal balances on existing debt and debt assumed in the csk acquisition  debt issuance costs and prepayment costs in association with the financing of the acquisition of csk 
the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in versus is due to net repayments of long term debt 
on july   in connection with the acquisition of csk  we entered into a credit agreement for a five year billion asset based revolving credit facility abl credit facility arranged by bank of america  na  which we used to refinance debt  fund the cash portion of the acquisition  pay for other transaction related expenses and provide liquidity for the combined company going forward 
this facility replaced a previous unsecured  five year syndicated revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
the abl credit facility is comprised of a billion tranche a revolving credit facility and a million first in last out revolving credit facility filo tranche 
as part of the abl credit agreement  the company has pledged virtually all of its assets as collateral and is subject to an ongoing consolidated leverage ratio covenant 
on the date of the transaction  the amount of the borrowing base available  as described in the abl credit agreement  under the abl credit facility was billion of which we borrowed million 
we used borrowings under the abl credit facility to repay certain existing debt of csk  repay our million a senior notes and purchase all of the properties that had been leased under our synthetic lease facility 
we believe that cash expected to be provided by operating activities and our abl credit facility will be sufficient to fund both our short term and long term capital and liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
at december   our borrowing base was billion  of which we had borrowed million 
borrowings under the tranche a revolver bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either a base rate plus per annum or libor plus per annum  with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds 
borrowings under the filo tranche bear interest  at our option  at a rate equal to either a base rate plus per annum or libor plus per annum  with each rate being subject to adjustment based upon certain excess availability thresholds 
the base rate is equal to the higher of the prime lending rate established by bank of america from time to time and the federal funds effective rate as in effect from time to time plus 
fees related to unused capacity under the abl credit facility are assessed at a rate of of the remaining available borrowings under the facility  subject to adjustment based upon remaining unused capacity 
in addition  we paid customary commitment fees  letter of credit fees  underwriting fees and other administrative fees in respect of the credit facility 
on july   october   and november   we entered into interest rate swap transactions with branch banking and trust company bbt  bank of america  na ba and suntrust bank suntrust 
we entered into these interest rate swap transactions to mitigate the risk associated with our floating interest rate based on libor on an aggregate of million of our debt that is outstanding under our abl credit agreement  dated as of july  we are required to make certain monthly fixed rate payments calculated on the notional amounts  while the applicable counter party is obligated to make certain monthly floating rate payments to us referencing the same notional amount 
the interest rate swap transactions effectively fix the annual interest rate payable on these notional amounts of our debt  which may exist under the abl credit facility plus an applicable margin under the terms of the abl credit facility 
the counterparties  transaction dates  effective dates  applicable notional amounts  effective index rates and maturity dates of each of the interest rate swap transactions are included in the table below counterparty transaction date effective date notional amount in thousands effective index rate spread at december  effective interest rate at december  maturity date bbt suntrust ba suntrust bbt bbt ba suntrust ba suntrust on july   o reilly agreed to become a guarantor  on a subordinated basis  of the million principal amount of exchangeable senior notes due the notes originally issued by csk 
the notes are exchangeable  under certain circumstances  into cash and shares of our common stock 
the notes bear interest at per year until december   and until maturity on december  prior to their stated maturity  the notes are exchangeable by the holders only under certain circumstances 
prior to their stated maturity  these notes are exchangeable by the holder only under the following circumstances as more fully described in the indenture under which the notes were issued during any fiscal quarter and only during that fiscal quarter commencing after july   if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the applicable exchange price of for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  if the notes have been called for redemption by the company  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  such as a change in control 
upon exchange of the notes  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged and our total exchange obligation and  in the event our total exchange obligation exceeds the aggregate principal amount of notes to be exchanged  shares of our common stock in respect of that excess 
the total exchange obligation reflects the exchange rate whereby each  in principal amount of the notes is exchangeable into an equivalent value of shares of our common stock and in cash 
the noteholders may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest on december   december   or december   or on any date following a fundamental change as described in the indenture 
we may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest on or after december   upon at least calendar days notice 
off balance sheet arrangements we have utilized various financial instruments from time to time as sources of cash when such instruments provided a cost effective alternative to our existing sources of cash 
we do not believe  however  that we are dependent on the availability of these instruments to fund our working capital requirements or our growth plans 
on december   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction with an unrelated party 
under the terms of the transaction  we sold properties  including land  buildings and improvements  which generated million of cash 
the lease  which is being accounted for as an operating lease  provides for an initial lease term of years and may be extended for one initial ten year period and two additional successive periods of five years each 
the resulting gain of million has been deferred and is being amortized over the initial lease term 
net rent expense during the initial term will be approximately million annually 
in august  we entered into a sale leaseback with o reilly wooten llc an entity owned by certain affiliates of the company 
the transaction involved the sale and leaseback of nine o reilly auto parts stores and generated approximately million of cash 
the transaction did not result in a material gain or loss 
the lease  which has been accounted for as an operating lease  calls for an initial term of years with three five year renewal options 
on september   we completed a second amended and restated master agreement to our million synthetic operating lease facility with a group of financial institutions 
the terms of such lease facility provided for an initial lease period of seven years  a residual value guarantee of approximately million at december  and purchase options on the properties 
on july   we  in connection with the acquisition of csk  purchased all the properties included in our synthetic operating lease facility for million  thus terminating the facility 
the purchase was funded through borrowings under the abl credit facility 
we issue stand by letters of credit provided by a million sub limit under the abl credit facility that reduce our available borrowings 
these letters of credit are issued primarily to satisfy the requirements of workers compensation  general liability and other insurance policies 
substantially all of the outstanding letters of credit have a one year term from the date of issuance 
letters of credit totaling million and million were outstanding at december  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states gaap requires the application of certain estimates and judgments by management 
management bases its assumptions  estimates  and adjustments on historical experience  current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
management believes that the following policies are critical due to the inherent uncertainty of these matters and the complex and subjective judgments required to establish these estimates 
management continues to review these critical accounting policies and estimates to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with gaap 
however  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 
vendor concessions we receive concessions from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  allowances for warranties  merchandise allowances and volume purchase rebates 
co operative advertising allowances that are incremental to our advertising program  specific to a product or event and identifiable for accounting purposes  are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
all other material vendor concessions are recognized as a reduction to the cost of inventory 
amounts receivable from vendors also include amounts due to us relating to vendor purchases and product returns 
management regularly reviews amounts receivable from vendors and assesses the need for a reserve for uncollectible amounts based on our evaluation of our vendors financial position and corresponding ability to meet their financial obligations 
based on our historical results and current assessment  we have not recorded a reserve for uncollectible amounts in our consolidated financial statements  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that our ability to collect these amounts will differ from our expectations 
the eventual ability of our vendors to pay us the obliged amounts could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability  property loss  and employee health care benefits 
with the exception of employee health care benefit liabilities  which are limited by the design of these plans  we obtain third party insurance coverage to limit our exposure for any individual workers compensation  general liability  vehicle liability or property loss claim 
when estimating our self insurance liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience and trend lines  projected medical and legal inflation  and growth patterns and exposure forecasts 
the assumptions made by management as they relate to each of these factors represent our judgment as to the most probable cumulative impact of each factor to our future obligations 
our calculation of self insurance liabilities requires management to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date and the application of alternative assumptions could result in a different estimate of these liabilities 
actual claim activity or development may vary from our assumptions and estimates  which may result in material losses or gains 
as we obtain additional information that affects the assumptions and estimates we used to recognize liabilities for claims incurred in prior accounting periods  we adjust our self insurance liabilities to reflect the revised estimates based on this additional information 
the long term portions of these liabilities are recorded at our estimate of their net present value 
these liabilities do not have scheduled maturities  but we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns 
we could apply alternative assumptions regarding the timing of payments or the applicable discount rate that could result in materially different estimates of the net present value of the liabilities 
if self insurance reserves were changed from our estimated reserves at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  accounts receivable management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical loss ratios and other relevant factors 
actual results have consistently been within management s expectations  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future that will require a significant change in the assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
however  if actual results differ from our estimates  we may be exposed to losses or gains 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts were changed from our estimated allowance at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  taxes we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit 
the amount of such liabilities is based on various factors  such as differing interpretations of tax regulations by the responsible tax authority  experience with previous tax audits and applicable tax law rulings 
changes in our tax liability may occur in the future as our assessments change based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and or changes in tax regulations 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
the estimates of our potential tax liabilities contain uncertainties because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax positions and actual results could differ from our estimates 
alternatively  we could have applied assumptions regarding the eventual outcome of the resolution of open tax positions that could differ from our current estimates but that would still be reasonable given the nature of a particular position 
our judgment regarding the most likely outcome of uncertain tax positions has historically resulted in an estimate of our tax liability that is greater than actual results 
while our estimates are subject to the uncertainty noted in the preceding discussion  our initial estimates of our potential tax liabilities have historically not been materially different from actual results except in instances where we have reversed liabilities that were recorded for periods that were subsequently closed with the applicable taxing authority 
the accounting for our tax reserves changed with the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january  inventory obsolescence and shrink inventory  which consists of automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and tools is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the extended nature of the life cycle of our products is such that the risk of obsolescence of our inventory is minimal 
the products that we sell generally have applications in our markets for a relatively long period of time in conjunction with the corresponding vehicle population 
we have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the life cycle of a given product and  accordingly  have historically been very successful in adjusting the volume of our inventory in conjunction with a decrease in demand 
we do record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our inventory through a charge to cost of sales in the isolated instances where we believe that the market value of a product line is lower than our recorded cost 
this reserve is based on our assumptions about the marketability of our existing inventory and is subject to uncertainty to the extent that we must estimate  at a given point in time  the market value of inventory that will be sold in future periods 
ultimately  our projections could differ from actual results and could result in a material impact to our stated inventory balances 
we have historically not had to materially adjust our obsolescence reserves due to the factors discussed above and do not anticipate that we will experience material changes in our estimates in the future 
we also record a reserve to reduce the carrying value of our perpetual inventory to account for quantities in our perpetual records above the actual existing quantities on hand caused by unrecorded shrink 
we estimate this reserve based on the results of our extensive and frequent cycle counting programs and periodic  full physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers 
to the extent that our estimates do not accurately reflect the actual unrecorded inventory shrinkage  we could potentially experience a material impact to our inventory balances 
we have historically been able to provide a timely and accurate measurement of shrink and have not experienced material adjustments to our estimates 
if unrecorded shrink were changed from the estimate that we recorded based on our historical experience at december   the financial impact would have been approximately million or of pretax income for the year ended december  valuation of long lived assets and goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment 
a potential impairment has occurred if the projected future undiscounted cash flows realized from the best possible use of the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of that asset in operations 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment analyses contain estimates due to the inherently judgmental nature of forecasting long term estimated cash flows and determining the ultimate useful lives and fair values of the assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which could materially impact our impairment assessment 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
the company has not historically recorded an impairment to its goodwill or intangible assets 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including estimates which incorporate assumptions marketplace participants would use in making their estimates of fair value 
in the future  if events or market conditions affect the estimated fair value to the extent that an asset is impaired  the company will adjust the carrying value of these assets in the period in which the impairment occurs 
contractual obligations we have other liabilities reflected in our balance sheet  including deferred income taxes and self insurance accruals 
interest payments on our variable rate long term debt are not included in the financial commitments table 
the payment obligations associated with these liabilities are not reflected in the financial commitments table due to the absence of scheduled payments 
therefore  the timing of these payments cannot be determined  except for amounts estimated to be payable in that are included in current liabilities 
in addition  we have commitments with various vendors for the purchase of inventory as of december  the financial commitments table excludes these commitments because they are cancelable by their terms 
our contractual obligations  as in effect at december   including commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements  short and long term debt arrangements  interest payments related to long term debt  fixed payments related to interest rate swaps and purchase obligations for construction contract commitments  are summarized below and are fully disclosed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements

to the extent our acquisition cost increased due to base commodity price increases industry wide  we have typically been able to pass along these increased costs through higher retail prices for the affected products 
as a result  we do not believe our operations have been materially  adversely affected by inflation 
to some extent  our business is seasonal primarily as a result of the impact of weather conditions on customer buying patterns

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our credit facilities with variable interest rates 
at december   we did not have amounts borrowed against our variable rate credit facilities and  as a result  did not have material market risk exposure 
primarily as a result of borrowings in to fund the acquisition of csk  we have interest rate exposure with respect to the million outstanding balance on our variable interest rate debt at december   however  from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swaps to reduce this exposure 
on july   october   and november   we reduced our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into interest rate swap contracts the swaps with a total notional amount of million 
the swaps represent contracts to exchange a floating rate for fixed interest payments periodically over the life of the swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount 
the notional amount of the swap is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent the amount of exposure to credit loss 
the swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges 
if interest rates increased or decreased by basis points  annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately million million after tax  based on our exposure to interest rate changes on variable rate debt that is not covered by the swaps 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in an environment of adversely changing interest rates 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates and to the extent that we have amounts outstanding under our asset based credit facility  management would likely take further actions that would seek to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk
