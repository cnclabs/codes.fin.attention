item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview as of february   we operated casual dining restaurants featuring on premises breweries under the name granite city food brewery 
we intend to finance our working capital needs using the proceeds from the sale of our securities  debt and equipment financing and cash flow from operations 
although we have no further plans for expansion during other than the restaurant we opened in indianapolis  indiana in february  our future expansion will be in markets where we believe our concept will have broad appeal and attractive restaurant level economics 
our industry can be significantly affected by changes in economic conditions  discretionary spending patterns  consumer tastes  and cost fluctuations 
over the past year  consumers have been under increased economic pressures and as a result  many have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
many consumers are dining out less frequently than in the past and or have decreased the amount they spend on meals while dining out 
as guest traffic decreases  lower sales result in decreased leverage that leads to declines in operating margins 
to offset the negative impact of decreased leverage in a declining sales environment while protecting our guests dining experience  we have undertaken a series of initiatives to renegotiate the pricing of all aspects of our business  effectively reducing our cost of food  insurance  payroll processing  shipping  supplies and most recently  our property and equipment rent 
we have also begun implementing marketing initiatives designed to increase brand awareness and help drive guest traffic 
we believe that our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  operating results of new restaurants  changes in food and labor costs  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  nutritional concerns and discretionary spending patterns  competitive factors  the skill and experience of our restaurant level management teams and weather conditions 
we expect the timing of new restaurant openings to have a significant impact on restaurant revenue and costs 
we believe we will incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a new restaurant within the two months immediately preceding  and the month of  the opening of such restaurant 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the last tuesday of december to account for our operations 
all references to and within the following discussion represent the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
fiscal year consisted of weeks while fiscal year consisted of weeks

wayne  indiana toledo  ohio south bend  indiana total restaurant weeks we provide the statistical measure of restaurant weeks to enhance the comparison of revenue from period to period as changes occur in the number of restaurants we are operating 
our restaurant revenue is comprised almost entirely of the sales of food and beverages 
the sale of retail items typically represents less than one percent of total revenue 
product costs include the costs of food  beverages and retail items 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related costs 
pre opening costs consist of direct costs related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  the salaries and related costs of our dedicated new restaurant opening team  rent expense incurred during the construction period and other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
general and administrative costs are comprised of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations  which include management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  market research  professional fees  supplies and corporate rent 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures at the restaurant and corporate levels and amortization of intangibles that do not have indefinite lives 
interest expense represents the cost of interest expense on debt and capital leases net of interest income on invested assets

critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of our financial statements property and equipment the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to years 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the initial term of the related lease  which is generally years 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes 
amortization of assets acquired under capital lease is included in depreciation expense 
we review property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
we base this assessment upon the carrying value versus the fair market value 
table of contents of the asset and whether or not that difference is recoverable 
such assessment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis and includes other relevant facts and circumstances including the physical condition of the asset 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
we continually reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates we have made 
leasing activities we have entered into various leases for our buildings  equipment and for ground leases 
at the inception of a lease  we evaluate it to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease pursuant to sfas no 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the date the lease agreement is signed and ends on the date the restaurant opens  during which no cash rent payments are typically due 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater pre opening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rent payments based upon restaurants sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease which can impact the classification and account for a lease as capital or operating 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  rent expense and interest expense than would be reported if different assumptions were made 
stock based compensation we have granted stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r 
under such provisions  stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
under the black scholes option pricing model  we determine the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date 
this requires judgment  including but not limited to judgment concerning the expected volatility of our stock 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is derived from the sale of prepared food and beverage and select retail items and is recognized at the time of sale 
revenue derived from gift card sales is recognized at the time the gift card is redeemed 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  the outstanding balances on such cards are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we recognize gift card breakage amounts based upon historical redemption patterns  which represent the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
such amounts are included as a reduction to our general and administrative expense 
we arrive at this amount using certain management judgments and estimates 
such judgments and estimates may produce different amounts of breakage than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
estimated liability for closing restaurants we continually evaluate the performance of each of our restaurants 
if a restaurant consistently performs poorly  we consider many factors including the demographics of the location and the likelihood of being able to improve the performance of the restaurant 
if we determine that the restaurant will not  within a reasonable period of time  perform to our expectations  we may close the restaurant 
in the event we close a restaurant  we record the liability to cover future lease termination costs using the fair value of these liabilities as estimated in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this estimate is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee we expect to pay 
the amount of the estimated liability established is generally the present value of these estimated net future payments upon exiting the property 
a significant assumption we use in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing a restaurant is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant restaurants  determined based on the likelihood of successfully negotiating an early termination of the lease agreement with our landlord or subleasing the property 
if it takes longer than anticipated to terminate or sublease the lease  we may need to record additional estimated liability 
if the lease on the vacant restaurant is not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liability  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the lease on the vacant restaurant is terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liability  we would reverse all or some portion of the previously established estimated liability  resulting in an increase in operating income 
results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december  revenue we generated  and  of revenue during fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in revenue of for over was primarily the result of the additional restaurant operating weeks in due to the additional fiscal week in the third quarter of fiscal and the eight restaurants that opened in the second half of and in fiscal year included  restaurant operating weeks while fiscal year included operating weeks 
comparable restaurant revenue  which included restaurants in operation over months  increased from to  primarily due to the additional fiscal week in and price increases of approximately each in the third quarter of and first quarter of  partially offset by a decrease in guest traffic  which we believe was caused primarily by the macroeconomic factors affecting the restaurant industry in general 
average weekly revenue per comparable restaurant decreased  from  in to  in 
table of contents we expect that restaurant revenue will vary from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate continued seasonal fluctuations in restaurant revenue due in part to increased outdoor seating and generally favorable weather conditions at many of our locations during the summer months 
due to the honeymoon effect that periodically occurs with the opening of a restaurant  we expect the timing of new restaurant openings to cause fluctuations in restaurant revenue 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  timing of holidays  consumer confidence in the economy and changes in consumer preferences may affect our future revenue 
we believe that decreased consumer confidence negatively impacted the restaurant industry as a whole beginning in and continuing throughout fiscal year restaurant costs food and beverage our food and beverage costs  as a percentage of revenue  remained steady at in fiscal years and while the cost of dairy  chicken  beef  bread  general groceries  soft drinks and beer increased in  we believe our pricing negotiations with our suppliers  our menu price increase of approximately in march and our increased oversight of inventory and kitchen management offset these commodity price increases 
due to the number of restaurants we now operate throughout the midwest  we are able to contract for many of the food commodities we use in our restaurants for periods up to one year 
we expect our overall food costs to decrease by approximately in based on several new contracts entered into in the later part of by reducing our exposure to commodity price increases  we believe we will be able to maintain or reduce our food and beverage costs as a percentage of revenue for we do  however  expect that our food and beverage costs will continue to vary going forward due to numerous variables  including seasonal changes in food and beverage costs for which we do not have contracted pricing  and guest preferences 
we periodically create new menu offerings and introduce new craft brewed beers based upon guest preferences 
although such menu modifications may temporarily result in increased food and beverage cost  we believe we are able to offset such increases with our weekly specials which provide variety and value to our guests 
our varieties of craft brewed beer  which we believe we can produce at lower cost than beers we purchase for resale  also enable us to keep our food and beverage costs low while fulfilling guest requests and building customer loyalty 
we expect food and beverage costs at our newer restaurants to be higher initially due to inefficiencies that are part of the start up process of a new restaurant 
additionally  with future expansion  we believe our brewing process will allow us to keep our high quality beer products intact while leveraging our fixed production costs  thereby enhancing overall profitability 
labor labor expense consists of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items including management bonuses  and non cash stock based compensation expense 
our experience to date has been that staff labor costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
our labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  increased to in from in due primarily to new restaurant openings late in and early in  as well as minimum wage increases and turnover 
in the second half of  labor as a percentage of revenue decreased compared to the second half of as our new restaurants began to stabilize and we trained new managers on a number of operational metrics and initiatives focused on manager accountability and internal development of restaurant level staff  we were able to reduce labor costs as a percentage of revenue 

table of contents we expect that labor costs will vary as minimum wage laws  local labor laws and practices  as well as unemployment rates vary from state to state  as will hiring and training expenses 
we believe that retaining good employees and more experienced staff ensures high quality guest service and may reduce hiring and training costs 
direct restaurant operating operating supplies  repairs and maintenance  utilities  promotions and restaurant level administrative expense represent the majority of our direct restaurant operating expense  a substantial portion of which is fixed or indirectly variable 
our direct restaurant operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in this increase was due to operating inefficiencies during the first few months at newly opened restaurants  as well as increased costs of paper products  utilities and expenses related to repair and maintenance at our mature properties  offset in part by a decrease in marketing and administrative expenses 
we anticipate reducing our direct operating costs going forward as we have taken initiatives to renegotiate pricing on all aspects of these costs including credit card processing  supplies  utilities  shipping and various services 
while we started seeing the effects of these negotiations in late  we believe we will see the full benefit of the resulting cost reductions in occupancy our occupancy costs  which include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property insurance and property taxes  increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in while rent expense and property tax costs increased slightly year over year  they were offset in part by a decrease in property and casualty insurance 
while our occupancy cost is expected to change as a result of the master agreement entered into with the dunham entities in  the overall effect of these changes has not yet been determined as the parties are assessing restaurant by restaurant lease reductions as well as changes in the terms of the leases 
pre opening pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  wages and expenses of our dedicated new restaurant opening teams  rental costs incurred during the construction period and certain other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
pre opening costs  excluding construction period rent  are primarily incurred in the month of  and two months prior to  restaurant opening 
pre opening costs decreased  to  in from  in included in such expense was  and  of non cash rental costs incurred during construction periods in and  respectively  and  and  of payroll related costs in and  respectively 
in  pre opening costs included expenses related to the four restaurants we opened in as well as a portion of the expenses related to the three restaurants we opened in the first quarter of in  we recognized only the remaining pre opening expense of the three restaurants we opened in the first quarter of  the expenses related to the restaurant we opened in south bend  indiana in july and a portion of the expenses related to the restaurant we opened in indianapolis  indiana in february general and administrative general and administrative expense includes all salaries and benefits  including non cash stock based compensation  associated with our corporate staff that is responsible for overall restaurant quality  future expansion into new locations  financial controls and reporting  restaurant management recruiting  management training  excess capacity costs related to our beer production facility  and 
table of contents salaries and expenses of our new restaurant opening team when it is not dedicated to a particular restaurant opening 
other general and administrative expense includes advertising  professional fees  investor relations  office administration  centralized accounting system costs and travel by our corporate management 
general and administrative expense increased  to  in from  in the primary sources of such increase were expenses related to recruiting  relocation  training and consulting costs  as well as accounting and legal services and marketing expense 
we undertook an ambitious recruiting plan to upgrade our overall restaurant management teams 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in insurance  non cash stock based compensation and an adjustment of  for the portion of our gift card obligation for which we believe the likelihood of redemption is remote 
non cash stock based compensation included in general and administrative expense was  and  in and  respectively 
despite the foregoing increase in general and administrative expense  the increase in restaurant revenue associated with additional locations caused our general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue to in from in we believe our initiatives to renegotiate pricing with our vendors will assist us in reducing future general and administrative expense 
we have negotiated cost reductions related to shipping  insurance and payroll processing and we continue to focus on all aspects of contracted goods and services 
we will closely monitor our general and administrative expense while seeking to preserve an infrastructure that remains suitable for our current operations and future expansion 
although we may need to recruit additional personnel to provide continued oversight of operations  we expect our turnover ratios for to return to levels more consistent with the industry  allowing us to reduce our costs 
to the extent our turnover increases above our expectations  additional costs above our budgeted figures could be incurred in our recruiting and training expenses 
we believe our general and administrative expense and our general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue will decrease in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  to  in from  in  due principally to the additional depreciation related to new restaurants 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation expense increased to in from in exit or disposal activities in august  we closed our rogers  arkansas restaurant 
since opening in october  the restaurant failed to generate positive cash flow and had approximately million of net loss 
we believe the closure of this restaurant will allow management to focus its capital and personnel resources on its other restaurants in order to increase future operating efficiencies and cash flow 
we are working to find a replacement tenant for the location  for which we are bound by a year net lease 
costs incurred in connection with this closure include one time benefits to employees who were involuntarily terminated of approximately  costs incurred for early contract termination of approximately  and costs to close and maintain the facility of approximately  we will incur ongoing costs such as utilities  landscape and maintenance and general liability insurance until we are able to find a replacement tenant 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded a non cash lease termination liability of  based on management s estimate of the fair value of these obligations 
this required management to estimate the present value of the future minimum lease obligations offset by the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  related to the write off of the carrying value of the restaurant equipment at the rogers location 
all costs related to the closing of the rogers restaurant  
table of contents including the asset impairment charge  aggregated  and are reflected in our income statement as exit or disposal activities 
as part of the master agreement we entered into with the dunham entities in february  we will reimburse dunham for any out of pocket expenses incurred less net proceeds from the sale of the real estate or lease income associated with the site 
reimbursement of costs related to this site will be amortized and payable to dunham over a month period commencing january  at a interest rate 
such reimbursement includes the carrying cost of the related land until its disposal 
interest net interest expense consists of interest expense on capital leases and long term debt  net of interest earned from cash on hand 
interest expense increased  to  in from  in the increase was due to additional capital leases as a result of new restaurants and equipment leases 
interest income decreased  in over due to the reduction of cash on hand 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  of cash and a  working capital deficit  compared to  of cash and a  working capital deficit at december  during the year ended december   we obtained proceeds of  pursuant to capital lease agreements and made payments aggregating  on our debt and capital lease obligations 
we received net cash of  from issuance of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
we used  of net cash in operating activities and  of net cash to purchase equipment and other assets primarily related to our new restaurants and beer production facility 
during the year ended december   we received net cash of  from the issuance of our common stock  of which  was received from the exercise of options and warrants while the remainder represented the net proceeds from the sale of common stock in march  as detailed below 
we obtained proceeds of  pursuant to capital lease agreements and made payments aggregating  on our debt and capital lease obligations 
of such capital lease payments  approximately million represented a one time payment to retire debt obtained from dhw  as detailed below 
we used  of net cash in operating activities and  of net cash to purchase equipment and other assets primarily related to our new restaurant expansion 
on february   we entered into a master agreement with dunham capital management  llc dunham  dhw leasing  llc dhw and dunham equity management  llc collectively  the dunham entities to provide rent or other cash flow reductions to us in the amount of million for the calendar year and million for calendar year the master agreement provides that the dunham entities will amend and restate applicable leases and subleases to reflect negotiated rent reductions 
we commenced paying reduced rent in january in anticipation of finalizing the master agreement  which reductions are deemed to be part of the negotiated rent reductions 
as a part of the master agreement  dunham has agreed to amend its leases with us that are currently treated as capital leases for accounting purposes by reducing their terms to periods which will thereafter qualify the leases to be treated as operating leases in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
each lease will be modified for a term of not less than years and will provide that the tenant will have three consecutive options to extend the leases for five years per extension 
additionally  we agreed to reimburse dunham for any out of pocket costs that dunham incurs due to the closing of the rogers  arkansas location and the decision not to build on the troy  michigan site less net sales proceeds from the sale of any real estate or lease income associated with such sites 
reimbursement of costs related to these sites will be amortized and payable to dunham over a month period commencing january  at a interest rate 
such 
table of contents reimbursement includes the carrying cost of the related land until its disposal 
in consideration of the agreements of dunham provided in the master agreement  we issued to the dunham entities a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  representing of the closing price of our common stock on the trading date prior to the date of signing the master agreement 
subsequently  in february  we entered into agreements with certain of our other landlords for rent reductions 
such rent reductions are deemed to be part of the above referenced million in rent reductions 
in consideration of such rent reductions  we have agreed to issue five year warrants to purchase our common stock to such landlords 
each warrant is exercisable at of the closing price of our common stock on the trading date prior to the date on which we received the executed rent relief agreement  and are issued only to accredited investors 
as of february   the aggregate number of shares underlying such warrants was  shares and the weighted average exercise price was per share 
no discount or commission was paid in connection with the issuance of the warrants 
in april  we entered into a development agreement with united properties for the development of up to restaurants to be built between and our new developer  united properties  will be responsible for all costs related to the land and building of each restaurant 
the development agreement provides for a cooperative process between united properties and our management for the selection of restaurant sites and the development of restaurants on those sites and scheduling for the development and construction of each restaurant once a location is approved 
we will lease each restaurant developed under this agreement from united properties 
the annual lease rate for fee simple land and building developments will be and we will have the right of first offer to purchase these restaurants 
additionally  in the event united properties sells one of the buildings that it develops for us at an amount in excess of the threshold agreed to by the parties in the agreement  then we will share in the profits of that sale 
we assume no liability in the event united properties sells a building at a loss 
we are not bound to authorize the construction of restaurants during that time period  but generally cannot use another developer to develop or own a restaurant as long as the development agreement is in effect 
we can  however  use another developer if united properties declines to build a particular restaurant 
in addition  we also agreed to refrain from developing any new restaurants in without the consent of the dunham entities which will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld  with the exception of the indianapolis  indiana restaurant 
in december  we entered into an equipment lease commitment with dhw  relating to the lease of furniture  fixtures and equipment for current and future restaurants 
under the terms of the equipment lease commitment  dhw agreed to purchase and lease to us equipment costing up to million 
each five year lease is intended to be for equipment costing a minimum of million and a maximum of million per restaurant 
payments due dhw have an interest rate equal to the dhw bank base rate plus 
principal payments on the amounts borrowed depend upon the repayment schedule specified by the banks that have provided the financing commitments to dhw 
the lease financing is subject to the availability of financing commitments to dhw from its lenders 
we have the option to purchase the leased equipment for upon payment in full of all rent payments due under each lease 
we are not obligated to enter into any equipment leases with dhw and dhw is not obligated to provide equipment leases for restaurants that are not developed and constructed by dunham 
as of december   dhw had purchased and leased to us equipment costing million under this agreement 
subsequently  in february  dhw purchased and leased to us additional equipment costing million under this agreement 
the value of the equipment financed at each restaurant is approximately million and the current annual interest rate on each lease ranges from to in march  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with accredited investors under which we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we obtained gross proceeds of 
table of contents  paid our placement agents cash commissions aggregating  and paid expenses aggregating  pursuant to the conditions of the stock purchase agreement  we used approximately million of the  net proceeds to retire the entire balance of equipment lease debt we had obtained from dhw pursuant to the master lease agreement we entered into in september the remaining net proceeds from this placement were used to fund the expansion of our restaurant operations 
although we have no further plans for expansion during  other than the restaurant we opened in indianapolis  indiana in february  our future expansion will be in markets where we believe our concept will have broad appeal and attractive restaurant level economics 
we plan to continue using our restaurant prototype as we open future restaurants  however  where appropriate  we will convert existing restaurants to our granite city concept 
additionally  we intend to explore alternative restaurant designs to reduce the cost of our initial capital investment and we may alter our prototype to meet various state and local regulatory requirements  including  but not limited to  pollution control requirements  liquor license ordinances and smoking regulations 
based upon our existing prototype  we anticipate that pre opening costs and the initial purchase of furniture  fixtures and equipment will require an investment by us of approximately million for each new restaurant 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will require an investment by the developer of approximately million to million for the building and approximately million to million for the purchase of the land 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  labor markets and other variables 
we expect to expend additional capital in connection with our long term expansion plans so as to gain greater leverage of our current infrastructure 
as a result of our history of recurring losses  negative cash flow from operations and our accumulated deficit  we have carefully assessed our cash needs for the next months 
based on our december  cash position of million  the december million dhw equipment lease commitment  of which approximately million in lease financing remained available to us as of february   our landlords contractual commitments to rent reductions in and  and expected cash flows from operations assuming we meet or exceed our internal budget  our management believes we will have sufficient funds to maintain working capital needed for our operations in the sources of expected cash flow improvement for include areas such as  reduction in rent reductions and an additional  of such reductions in   reduction of food costs from newly negotiated contracts   reduction in human resources  recruiting and training costs   reduction in general liability insurance   reduction through the changes in the mug club program  lower labor cost through staffing based on sales per labor hour for all positions  and the reduction of management teams to levels consistent with revenue 
however  we may require further funding for operations during to address seasonally slower time periods during the year and or to address the possibility of experiencing lower than budgeted cash flows from operations if the economic slowdown continues to adversely affect the us economy and the restaurant industry in particular 
the amount of any such required funding would depend upon sales trends and our ability to generate positive cash flow 
we may also need to raise additional funds for future expansion depending upon the level of expansion determined to be appropriate in later years as compared to our cash flow 
if sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund expected capital needs  or our 
table of contents needs are greater than anticipated  we will be required to raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness or public or private sales of equity securities 
we continue to pursue debt and equity financing alternatives for working capital 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if financing is not available to us  we may be required to further curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows 
our ability to fund our operations in future periods will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we elect to raise additional capital through the issuance and sale of equity securities  the sales may be at prices below the market price of our stock  and our shareholders may suffer significant dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations  covenants and financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate and grow our business  and would cause us to incur additional interest expense and financing costs 
commitments capital leases as of december   we had capital lease agreements related to our restaurant properties 
of these leases  one expires in  two in  four in  three in  four in  seven in and the remaining two in  all with renewable options for additional periods 
twenty one of these lease agreements originated with dunham 
under of the leases  we may be required to pay additional contingent rent based upon restaurant sales 
the land portion of these leases is classified as an operating lease while the building portion of these leases is classified as a capital lease because its present value was greater than of the estimated fair value at the beginning of the lease and or the lease term represents or more of the expected life of the property 
in december  we entered into a land and building lease agreement for our beer production facility 
this ten year lease  which commenced february   allows us to purchase the facility at any time for plus the unamortized construction costs 
because the construction costs will be fully amortized through payment of rent during the base term  if the option is exercised at or after the end of the initial ten year period  the option price will be 
as such  the lease is classified as a capital lease 
we entered into a lease agreement in for the equipment and leasehold improvements at our st 
cloud  minnesota and sioux falls  south dakota restaurants and for equipment at our beer production facility 
the annual interest rate on such lease was approximately and such lease was paid in full in steven j 
wagenheim  our president  chief executive officer and one of our directors  and a former director of ours personally guaranteed this lease 
in august  we entered into a master lease agreement with carlton financial corporation carlton pursuant to which we could finance lease up to  of equipment purchases for three restaurant locations 
as of december   we had entered into three lease schedules and amendments to this master lease  pursuant to which we began leasing equipment for an initial lease term ranging from to months 
the value of the equipment financed at each of the three locations ranges from approximately million to million and the annual interest rate on each ranges from to annually 
we have provided carlton with refundable security deposits aggregating  as well as a security interest in certain other equipment 
in february  these lease schedules were amended to extend the terms by one year and reduce the monthly payments related to two of the lease schedules 
at the end of each initial lease term  we may  under the amended lease schedules  purchase carlton s interest in all  but not less than all  of the equipment for a purchase price equal to of the original cost of the equipment 
steven j 
wagenheim  our president  chief 
table of contents executive officer and one of our directors  was required to personally guarantee payments to be made to carlton under the lease financing and our board of directors agreed to compensate him for such guarantee 
the amount of annual compensation is of the balance of such leases and is calculated and accrued based on the weighted average daily balance of the leases at the end of each monthly accounting period 
in september  we entered into an equipment lease commitment and master equipment lease with dhw  relating to the lease of furniture  fixtures and equipment for restaurants 
the members of dhw are donald a 
dunham  charles j 
hey and steven j 
wagenheim 
mr 
wagenheim is our president  chief executive officer and one of our directors 
mr 
wagenheim owns a membership interest in dhw and had agreed to personally guarantee of dhw s indebtedness to its lenders  for which we paid mr 
wagenheim no guarantee fee 
under the terms of the equipment lease commitment  dhw purchased and leased to us equipment at six of our restaurants and we had the option to purchase the leased equipment for upon payment in full of all rent payments due under each lease 
the amount financed on each of these five year agreements ranged from to million and the annual interest rate on each lease was approximately annually

sfas r will apply prospectively to business combinations and certain other transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after the start of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   and

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   and earlier adoption is prohibited

management expects that implementation of this staff position in the first quarter of fiscal will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality we expect that our sales and earnings will fluctuate based on seasonal patterns 
we anticipate that our highest sales and earnings will occur in the second and third quarters due to the milder climate and availability of outdoor seating during those quarters in our markets 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  supplies and labor costs 
a large percentage of our restaurant personnel is paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
in the past  we have been able to minimize the effect of these increases through menu price increases and other strategies 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
changes in interest rate pursuant to the terms of our capital leases and long term debt  we will have balloon payments due over the next five years beginning in if it becomes necessary to refinance such balloon balances  we may not be able to secure financing at the same interest rate 
the effect of a higher interest rate would depend upon the negotiated financing terms 
changes in commodity prices many of the food products and other commodities we use in our operations are subject to price volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
fluctuations in commodity prices and or long term changes could have an adverse effect on us 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
to manage this risk in part  we have entered into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
we have entered into contracts through with certain suppliers of raw materials primarily hops for minimum purchases both in terms of quantity and in pricing 
as of december   our future obligations under such contracts aggregated approximately million 
although a large national distributor is our primary supplier of food  substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control commodity price risks 
additionally  we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  in response to food product price increases 
if  however  competitive circumstances limit our menu price flexibility  margins could be negatively impacted 
our company does not enter into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes
