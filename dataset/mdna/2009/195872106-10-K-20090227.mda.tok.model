item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
operating strategy our business objective as a multifamily focused reit is to generate stable and increasing cash flow and portfolio value for our shareholders through a strategy of realizing growth in income from our existing portfolio of properties  selectively acquiring and developing multifamily properties to grow our core portfolio and improve the age and quality of our multifamily apartment communities in growth markets located in the sunbelt region of the united states  employing a comprehensive capital maintenance program to maintain properties in first class condition  including recycling capital by selectively disposing of assets that are approaching or have reached their maximum investment potential and reinvesting the proceeds into opportunities with more perceived growth potential  managing our own properties  including our assets through joint venture arrangements  which enables us to better control our operating expenses and establish and maintain long term relationships with our office and retail tenants  maintaining our third party property management business  which increases cash flow through management fee income stream and establishes additional relationships with investors and tenants  and executing our plan to dispose of our for sale residential assets including condominium conversions and land held for future sale and for sale residential and mixed use developments 
financing strategy we seek to maintain a well balanced  conservative and flexible capital structure by targeting conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage  
table of contents extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt  borrowing primarily at fixed rates  and pursuing long term debt financings and refinancings on a secured or unsecured basis subject to market conditions 
we believe that these strategies have enabled  and should continue to enable  us to access the debt and equity capital markets to fund debt refinancings and the acquisition and development of additional properties 
as further discussed under liquidity and capital resources in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k  we expect that our availability under our existing unsecured credit facility  minimal debt maturities in  the number of unencumbered properties in our multifamily portfolio and the additional financing through fannie mae expected to be obtained in the first quarter of will provide sufficient liquidity to execute our business plan 
this liquidity  along with our projected asset sales is expected to allow us to execute our plan in the short term  without the dependency on the capital markets 
however  no assurance can be given that we will retain our investment grade rating 
see item ia risk factors risks associated with our indebtedness and financing activities a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance 
as discussed further below under recent events  in the first quarter of  we anticipate completing a million secured credit facility to be originated by pnc arcs llc and repurchased by fannie mae nyse fnm 
this credit facility is expected to mature in and will have a fixed interest rate of 
the credit facility will be collateralized by multifamily properties 
in addition to the fannie mae facility  we are continuing negotiations with fannie mae and freddie mac nyse fre to provide additional secured financing of up to an additional million with respect to certain of our existing other multifamily properties 
any proceeds from these financing arrangements are expected to be used to pay down outstanding borrowings on our unsecured credit facility  provide additional liquidity that can be used toward completion of our remaining ongoing developments  provide additional funding for our unsecured bond repurchase program and provide liquidity for our debt maturities through however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate any of these additional financing arrangements 
certain of our long term unsecured debt is trading at a discount to the current debt amount 
our board of trustees has approved a million unsecured senior note repurchase program 
we repurchased million principal amount of unsecured senior notes of our operating partnership during at a weighted average discount of to par value 
we will continue to selectively repurchase the unsecured debt of our operating partnership at a discount as funds are available and as current market conditions permit 
we may modify our borrowing policy and may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to gross asset value in the future 
to the extent that our board of trustees determines to seek additional capital  we may raise such capital through additional asset dispositions  equity offerings  secured financings  debt financings or retention of cash flow subject to provisions in the internal revenue code of  as amended  requiring the distribution by a reit of a certain percentage of taxable income and taking into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income or a combination of these methods 
property management we are experienced in the management and leasing of multifamily and commercial properties and believe that the management and leasing of our own portfolio has helped maintain consistent income growth and has resulted in reduced operating expenses from the properties

the proceeds from the dispositions were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our unsecured credit facility  fund development activities and for general corporate purposes

certain of the proceeds described above were received into temporary cash accounts pending the fulfillment of section exchange requirements

impairment the ongoing recession and significant deterioration in the stock and credit markets continue to adversely affect the condominium and single family housing markets 
during  the for sale real estate markets continued to 
table of contents remain unstable due to the limited availability of lending and other types of mortgages  the tightening of the credit standards and an oversupply of such assets  resulting in reduced sales velocity and reduced pricing in the real estate market 
as discussed above  in light of the ongoing recession and credit crisis  we have renewed our focus on liquidity  maintaining a strong balance sheet  addressing our near term debt maturities  managing our existing properties and operating our portfolio efficiently and reducing our overhead 
to help implement our plans to strengthen the balance sheet and deleverage the company  in january  our board of trustees decided to accelerate our plan to dispose of our for sale residential assets including condominium conversions and land held for future sale and for sale residential and mixed use developments and to postpone future development activities including previously identified future development projects until we determine that the current economic environment has sufficiently improved 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter  we recorded an impairment charge of million million in continuing operations  million in discontinued operations 
of this total  million is attributable to certain of our completed for sale residential properties and condominium conversions  million relates to properties originally planned as condominiums but were subsequently placed into the multifamily rental pool  million is attributable to land held for future mixed use and for sale residential developments  and million is attributable to a retail development 
the impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of each property and our current book value plus the estimated costs to complete 
we also incurred million of abandoned pursuit costs as a result of our decision to postpone future development activities including previously identified future development projects and million of restructuring charges related to a reduction in our development staff and other overhead personnel 
with respect to our retail development  colonial promenade nord du lac  we are reviewing various alternatives for this development  and have reclassified the amount spent to date from an active development to a future development 
the estimated fair value of this asset was calculated based upon the company s intent to sell this property upon stabilization  current assumptions regarding rental rates  costs to complete  lease up  holding period and the estimated sales price 
we calculate the fair values of each property and development project evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management  which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions continue to deteriorate or improve 
specific facts and circumstances of each project are evaluated  including local market conditions  traffic  sales velocity  relative pricing  and cost structure 
we will continue to monitor the specific facts and circumstances at our for sale properties and development projects 
if market conditions do not improve or if there is further market deterioration  it may impact the number of projects we can sell  the timing of the sales and or the prices at which we can sell them in future periods 
if we are unable to sell projects  we may incur additional impairment charges on projects previously impaired as well as on projects not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may exist  which would decrease the value of our assets as reflected on our balance sheet and adversely affect net income and shareholders equity 
there can be no assurances of the amount or pace of future for sale residential sales and closings  particularly given current market conditions

restructuring charges during the first quarter of  in an ongoing effort to focus on maintaining efficient operations of the current portfolio  we reduced our workforce by an additional employees through the elimination of certain positions resulting in an aggregate of approximately million in termination benefits and severance related charges  which we expect to record in the first quarter of we anticipate costs savings related to this reduction in force to be approximately million in distribution during january  our board of trustees declared a cash distribution to our shareholders and the partners of crlp in the amount of per share and per partnership unit  totaling approximately million

competition the ownership  development  operation and leasing of multifamily  office and retail properties are highly competitive 
we compete with domestic and foreign financial institutions  other reits  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  partnerships and individual investors for the acquisition of properties 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our operations competition for acquisitions could reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and result in increased prices for properties  which could adversely affect our return on properties we purchase in this form k for further discussion 
in addition  we compete for tenants in our markets primarily on the basis of property location  rent charged  services provided and the design and condition of improvements 
with respect to our multifamily business  we also compete with other quality apartment and for sale condominium projects owned by public and private companies

in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of quality apartment communities or potential purchasers of for sale condominium units

we anticipate that we will review our insurance coverage and policies from time to time to determine the appropriate levels of coverage  but we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain or maintain full coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
in addition  as of december   we are self insured up to million  million and million for general liability  workers compensation and property insurance  respectively

risk factors in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  set forth below are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of us  whether oral or written 
we wish to ensure that any forward looking statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements in order to maximize to the fullest extent possible the protections of the safe harbor established in the private securities litigation reform act of accordingly  any such statements are qualified in their entirety by reference to  and are accompanied by  the following important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from our forward looking statements 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected  and the trading price of our common shares could decline 
these forward looking statements are based on management s present expectations and beliefs about future events 
as with any projection or forecast  these statements are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances 
there may be additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial that also may impair our business operations 
you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
we have separated the risks into the following categories risks associated with real estate  risks associated with our operations  risks associated with our indebtedness and financing activities  risks associated with our organization and structure  risks related to our shares  and risks associated with income tax laws 
risks associated with real estate recession in the united states and the related downturn in the housing and real estate markets have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the united states economy is believed to have entered a recession sometime during the trends in both the real estate industry and the broader united states economy continue to be unfavorable and continue to adversely affect our revenues 
the ongoing recession and related reduction in spending  falling home prices and mounting job losses  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could  among other things  impede the ability of our residents at our multifamily properties and our tenants at our commercial properties and other parties with which we conduct business to perform their contractual obligations  which could lead to an increase in defaults by our residents  tenants and other contracting parties  which could adversely affect our revenues 
furthermore  our ability to lease our properties at favorable rates  or at all  is adversely affected by the increase in supply and deterioration in the multifamily market stemming from ongoing recession and is dependent upon the overall level of spending in the economy  which is adversely affected by  among other things  job losses and unemployment levels  recession  personal debt levels  the downturn in the housing market  stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future 
with regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties  the increasing rental of excess for sale condominiums  which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives  may further reduce our ability to lease our multifamily units and further depress rental rates in certain markets 
with regard to for sale residential properties  the market for our for sale residential properties depends on an active demand for new for sale housing and high consumer confidence 
continuing decline in demand  exacerbated by tighter credit standards for home buyers and foreclosures  has further contributed to an oversupply of housing alternatives adversely affecting the timing of sales and price at which we are able to sell our for sale residential properties and thereby adversely affecting our profits from for sale residential properties 
we cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain unfavorable  but if the markets remain weak or deteriorate further  our ability to lease our properties  our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets and the pace of condominium sales and closings and or the related sales prices may continue to weaken during 
table of contents we face numerous risks associated with the real estate industry that could adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
as a real estate company  we are subject to various changes in real estate conditions  particularly in the sunbelt region where our properties are concentrated  and any negative trends in such real estate conditions may adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
these conditions include worsening of national and regional economic conditions  such as those we are currently experiencing as a result of the ongoing recession as described above  as well as the deteriorating local economic conditions in our principal market areas  availability of financing  the inability of tenants to pay rent  the existence and quality of the competition  such as the attractiveness of our property as compared to our competitors properties based on considerations such as convenience of location  rental rates  amenities and safety record  increased operating costs  including increased real property taxes  maintenance  insurance and utilities costs  weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather related expenses  oversupply of multifamily  office  retail space  or single family housing or a reduction in demand for real estate in the markets in which our properties are located  a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of potential tenants of our multifamily properties deciding to purchase homes instead of renting  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent us from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and changing trends in the demand by consumers for merchandise offered by retailers conducting business at our retail properties 
moreover  other factors may affect our results of operations adversely  including changes in government regulations and other laws  rules and regulations governing real estate  zoning or taxes  changes in interest rate levels  the availability of financing and potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events  most of which are discussed elsewhere in the following risk factors 
any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit our ability to retain our residents  lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
our multifamily communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other multifamily and apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single and multi family homes 
competitive housing in a particular area and an increase in the affordability of owner occupied single and multi family homes due to  among other things  declining housing prices  mortgage interest rates and tax incentives and government programs to promote home ownership  could adversely affect our ability to retain residents  lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
we are subject to significant regulation  which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased costs and or an inability to pursue business opportunities 
local zoning and use laws  environmental statutes and other governmental requirements may restrict our development  expansion  rehabilitation and reconstruction activities 
these regulations may prevent or delay us from taking advantage of economic opportunities 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines  awards to private litigants of damages against us  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation or compliance 
in addition  we cannot predict what requirements may be enacted in the future or that such a requirement will not increase our costs of regulatory compliance or prohibit us from pursuing business opportunities that could be profitable to us 

table of contents real estate investments are illiquid  and therefore we may not be able to sell our properties in response to economic changes which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid generally  and may become even more illiquid during periods of economic downturn 
as a result  we may not be able to sell a property or properties quickly or on favorable terms in response to changes in the economy or other conditions when it otherwise may be prudent to do so 
this inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our properties could adversely affect our results of operations if we cannot sell an unprofitable property 
in the case of our for sale residential properties and condominiums  our inability to sell units in a timely manner could adversely affect our financial condition  among other things  by causing us to hold properties for a longer period than is otherwise desirable and requiring us to record impairment charges in connection with the properties see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our financial condition could also be adversely affected if we were  for example  unable to sell one or more of our properties in order to meet our debt obligations upon maturity 
in addition  the tax laws applicable to reits require that we hold our properties for investment  rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business  which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest 
therefore  we may be unable to vary our portfolio promptly in response to market conditions  which may adversely affect our financial position 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act and fair housing act could result in substantial costs 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or ada  and the fair housing amendment act of  or fhaa  and various state and local laws  all public accommodations and commercial facilities  including office buildings  must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with these requirements could involve removal of structural barriers from certain disabled persons entrances 
other federal  state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to such means of access 
noncompliance with the ada  fhaa or related laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines by government authorities  awards to private litigants of damages against us  substantial litigation costs and the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance 
risks associated with our operations our revenues are significantly influenced by demand for multifamily properties generally  and a decrease in such demand will likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
during  we changed the asset mix of our portfolio to focus predominately on multifamily properties 
as a result of this change in strategy  we are subject to a greater extent to risks inherent in investments in a single industry 
a decrease in the demand for multifamily properties would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
resident demand at multifamily properties has been and could continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing recession and the related reduction in spending  falling home prices and mounting job losses  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions the in financial and credit markets  as well as the rate of household formation or population growth in our markets  changes in interest rates or changes in supply of  or demand for  similar or competing multifamily properties in an area 
to the extent that any of these conditions occur and continue to occur  they are likely to affect occupancy and market rents at multifamily properties  which could cause a decrease in our rental revenue 
any such decrease could impair our ability to satisfy our substantial debt service obligations or make distributions to our shareholders 
our ability to dispose of our existing inventory of condominium and for sale residential assets could adversely affect our results of operations 
to help implement our plans to strengthen the balance sheet and deleverage the company  in january  our board of trustees decided to accelerate plans to dispose of our for sale residential assets including condominium conversions and land held for future for sale residential and mixed use developments until we determine that the 
table of contents current economic environment has sufficiently improved 
exiting these markets may expose us to the following risks local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand  may result in reduced or fluctuating sales  for sale properties under development or acquired for development usually generate little or no cash flow until completion of development and sale of a significant number of homes or condominium units and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion and until such homes or condominium units are sold  we may abandon development or conversion opportunities that we have already begun to explore  and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities  we may be unable to close on sales of individual units under contract  buyers may be unable to qualify for financing  sales prices may be lower than anticipated  competition from other condominiums and other types of residential housing may result in reduced or fluctuating sales  we could be subject to liability claims from condominium associations or others asserting that construction performed was defective  resulting in litigation and or settlement discussions  and we may be unable to attract sales prices with respect to our for sale assets that compensate us for our costs 
after reevaluating our operating strategy in light of the ongoing recession and credit crisis  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of largely attributable to our condominium and for sale residential assets 
see item  impairment  of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding this impairment charge 
if market conditions do not improve or if there is further market deterioration  it may impact the number of projects we can sell  the timing of the sales and or the prices at which we can sell them 
if we are unable to sell projects  we may incur additional impairment charges on projects previously impaired as well as on projects not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may exist  which would decrease the value of our assets as reflected on our balance sheet and adversely affect our shareholders equity 
there can be no assurances of the amount or pace of future for sale residential sales and closings  particularly given current market conditions 
our properties may not generate sufficient rental income to pay our expenses if we are unable to lease our new properties or renew leases or re lease space at our existing properties as leases expire  which may adversely affect our operating results 
we derive the majority of our income from residents and tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
a number of factors may adversely affect our ability to attract tenants at favorable rental rates and generate sufficient income  including local conditions such as an oversupply of  or reduction in demand for  multifamily  office or retail properties  the attractiveness of our properties to residents  shoppers and tenants  decreases in market rental rates  and our ability to collect rent from our residents and tenants 
if we cannot generate sufficient income to pay our expenses  maintain our properties and service our debt as a result of any of these factors  our operating results may be adversely affected 
furthermore  the ongoing recession and related reduction in spending  falling home prices and mounting job losses  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could  among other things  impede the ability of our residents or tenants to perform their contractual obligations  which could lead to an increase in defaults by residents and tenants 
the residents at our multifamily properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from six months to one year 
tenants at our office properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from three to ten years and tenants at our retail properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from 
table of contents one to ten years 
as leases expire at our existing properties  residents and tenants may elect not to renew them 
even if our residents and tenants do renew or if we can re lease the space  the terms of renewal or re leasing  including the cost of required renovations may be less favorable than current lease terms 
in addition  for new properties  we may be unable to attract enough residents and tenants and the occupancy rates and rents may not be sufficient to make the property profitable 
if we are unable to renew the leases or re lease the space at our existing properties promptly and or lease the space at our new properties  or if the rental rates upon renewal or re leasing at existing properties are significantly lower than expected rates  or if there is an increase in tenant defaults  our operating results will be negatively affected 
we may not be able to control our operating costs or our expenses may remain constant or increase  even if our revenues decrease  causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 
factors that may adversely affect our ability to control operating costs include the need to pay for insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes  which could increase over time  the need periodically to repair  renovate and re lease space  the cost of compliance with governmental regulation  including zoning and tax laws  the potential for liability under applicable laws  interest rate levels  and the availability of financing 
if our operating costs increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
the expense of owning and operating a property is not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 
as a result  if revenues drop  we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly 
costs associated with real estate investments  such as real estate taxes  loan payments and maintenance generally will not be reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease 
if a property is mortgaged and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments  the lender could foreclose on the mortgage and take the property  resulting in a further reduction in net income 
we are subject to increased exposure to economic and other factors due to the concentration of our properties in the sunbelt region  and economic downturns  natural disasters or acts of terrorism in the sunbelt region could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
substantially all of our properties are located in the sunbelt region of the united states 
in particular  we derived approximately of our net operating income in from top quartile cities located in the sunbelt region 
we are therefore subject to increased exposure to economic and other factors specific to these geographic areas 
if the sunbelt region of the united states  and in particular the areas of or near birmingham  charlotte  orlando  atlanta  dallas or fort worth  experiences a recession or other slowdown in the economy  a natural disaster or an act of terrorism  our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected as a result of decreased revenues  increased costs or damage or loss of assets 
tenant bankruptcies and downturns in tenants businesses may adversely affect our operating results by decreasing our revenues 
at any time  a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition 
additionally  the ongoing recession and related reduction in spending  falling home prices and mounting job losses  together with the price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the financial and credit markets could  among other things  adversely affect our tenants financially and impede their ability to perform their contractual obligations 
as a result  our tenants may delay lease commencement  cease or defer making rental payments or declare bankruptcy 
a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant  or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases  
table of contents and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims  and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected 
as a result  it is likely that we will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold from a bankrupt tenant 
the bankruptcy or financial difficulties of any of our tenants may negatively affect our operating results by decreasing our revenues 
risks associated with the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing our revenues 
in addition to the risks we face as a result of our ownership of real estate  we face risks relating to the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses of cpsi  including risks that management contracts or service agreements with third party owners will be terminated and lost to competitors  contracts will not be renewed upon expiration or will not be available for renewal on terms consistent with current terms  and leasing and brokerage activity generally may decline 
each of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing our revenues 
we could incur significant costs related to environmental issues which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased compliance costs or our financial condition if we become subject to a significant liability 
under federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of on real property  may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating hazardous substances on or under or released from the property and for damages to natural resources 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation liability act  and similar state laws  generally impose liability on a joint and several basis  regardless of whether the owner  operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of our properties  we could be liable in the future for costs associated with investigation and remediation of hazardous substances released at or from such properties 
the costs of any required remediation and related liability as to any property could be substantial under these laws and could exceed the value of the property and or our assets 
the presence of hazardous substances  or the failure to properly remediate those substances may result in our being liable for damages suffered by a third party for personal injury  property damage  cleanup costs  or otherwise and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral 
in addition  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which we use our properties or operate our business  and these restrictions may require expenditures for compliance 
the restrictions themselves may change from time to time  and these changes may result in additional expenditures in order to achieve compliance 
we cannot assure you that a material environmental claim or compliance obligation will not arise in the future 
the costs of defending against any claims of liability  of remediating a contaminated property  or of complying with future environmental requirements could be substantial and affect our operating results 
in addition  if a judgment is obtained against us or we otherwise become subject to a significant environmental liability  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
during  we engaged in the expansion of our wal mart center at colonial promenade winter haven in orlando  florida 
we received notice that the property that was purchased for the expansion contained environmental contamination that required remediation 
we agreed to pay million towards the remediation  which was paid during the expansion was completed in  but we are still awaiting a no further action letter from the relevant regulatory agency 

table of contents costs associated with addressing indoor air quality issues  moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold or other air contaminants has been increasing as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there have been a number of lawsuits in our industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to indoor air quality  moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
the terms of our property and general liability policies generally exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against us  we would be required to use our funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
we make no assurance that liabilities resulting from indoor air quality  moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as the owner or operator of real property  we could become subject to liability for asbestos containing building materials in the buildings on our properties 
some of our properties may contain asbestos containing materials 
environmental laws typically require that owners or operators of buildings with asbestos containing building materials properly manage and maintain these materials  adequately inform or train those who may come in contact with asbestos and undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  in the event that asbestos is disturbed during building renovation or demolition 
these laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
in addition  third parties may be entitled to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos containing building materials 
uninsured or underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition 
as of december   we are self insured up to million  million and million for general liability  workers compensation and property insurance  respectively 
we are also self insured for health insurance and responsible for claims up to  per claim and up to million per person  according to plan policy limits 
if the actual costs incurred to cover such uninsured claims are significantly greater than our budgeted costs  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties and appropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as lease and other contract claims  acts of war or terrorism  acts of god  and in some cases  earthquakes  hurricanes and flooding that generally are not insured because such coverage is not available or it is not available at commercially reasonable rates 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in the damaged property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated 
we cannot predict at this time if in the future we will be able to obtain full coverage at a reasonable cost 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors also might make it impractical or undesirable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
we may be unable to develop new properties or redevelop existing properties successfully  which could adversely affect our results of operations due to unexpected costs  delays and other contingencies 
our operating strategy historically has included development of new properties  as well as expansion and or redevelopment of existing properties 
even though we decided in january to postpone future development activities including previously identified future development projects until we determine that the current economic environment has sufficiently improved  we expect to complete our developments currently in process and may engage in additional developments as opportunities arise 
development activity may be conducted through wholly owned affiliates or through joint ventures 
however  there are significant risks associated with such development 
table of contents activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of developed properties 
these risks include the following we may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs and or lower than expected leases  local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand  may result in reduced or fluctuating rental rates  we may incur development costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs or unforeseen environmental conditions  which could make completion of the property uneconomical  land  insurance and construction costs continue to increase in our markets and may continue to increase in the future and we may be unable to attract rents that compensate for these increases in costs  we may abandon development opportunities that we have already begun to explore  and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities  rental rates and occupancy levels may be lower than anticipated  changes in applicable zoning and land use laws may require us to abandon projects prior to their completion  resulting in the loss of development costs incurred up to the time of abandonment  and we may experience late completion because of construction delays  delays in the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control 
in addition  if a project is delayed  certain tenants may have the right to terminate their leases 
furthermore  from time to time we may utilize tax exempt bond financing through the issuance of community development and special assessment district bonds to fund development costs 
under the terms of such bond financings  we may be responsible for paying assessments on the underlying property to meet debt service obligations on the bonds until the underlying property is sold 
accordingly  if we are unable to complete or sell a development property subject to such bond financing and we are forced to hold the property longer than we originally projected  we may be obligated to continue to pay assessments to meet debt service obligations under the bonds 
if we are unable to pay the assessments  a default will occur under the bonds and the property could be foreclosed upon 
any one or more of these risks may cause us to incur unexpected development costs  which would negatively affect our results of operations 
our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 
as of december   we had ownership interests in joint ventures 
our investments in these joint ventures involve risks not customarily associated with our wholly owned properties  including the following we share decision making authority with some of our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and the joint venture properties  such as the acquisition of properties  the sale of the properties or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the properties  which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by those joint venture partners  prior consent of our joint venture partners is required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture  which restricts our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture  our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  which may delay construction or development of a joint venture property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture  our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the joint venture properties that conflict with our business interests and goals  which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership  management or disposition of such properties  
table of contents disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the joint venture properties or the joint venture  which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and or trustees from focusing their time and effort on our business  and possibly disrupt the day to day operations of the property such as by delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved see  for example  the discussion under note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments  and our joint venture partner may elect to sell or transfer its interests in the joint venture to a third party  which may result in our loss of management and leasing responsibilities and fees that we currently receive from the joint venture properties 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to perform under various financial guarantees that we have provided with respect to certain of our joint ventures and retail developments 
from time to time  we guarantee portions of the indebtedness of certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations guarantees and other arrangements of this annual report on form k  for a description of the guarantees that we have provided with respect to the indebtedness of certain of our joint ventures as of december  from time to time  in connection with certain retail developments  we receive funding from municipalities for infrastructure costs through the issuance of bonds that are repaid primarily from sales tax revenues generated from the tenants at each respective development 
in some instances  we guarantee the shortfall  if any  of tax revenues to the debt service requirements on these bonds 
if we are required to fund any amounts related to any of these guarantees  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
in addition  we may not be able to ultimately recover funded amounts 
competition for acquisitions could reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and result in increased prices for properties  which could adversely affect our return on properties we purchase 
we compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities in multifamily  office and retail properties 
these competitors include publicly traded reits  private reits  domestic and foreign financial institutions  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  investment banking firms  private institutional investment funds and national  regional and local real estate investors 
this competition could increase the demand for multifamily properties  and therefore reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such acquisition properties 
as a result  our expected return from investment in these properties would deteriorate 
acquired properties may expose us to unknown liability 
we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities 
as a result  if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties  we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include liabilities for clean up of undisclosed environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties  liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business  and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties 
we may be unable to successfully integrate and effectively manage the properties we acquire  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
so long as we are able to obtain capital on commercially reasonable terms  and as economic conditions warrant  we intend to selectively acquire multifamily properties that meet our criteria for investment opportunities  
table of contents are consistent with our business strategies and that we believe will be profitable or will enhance the value of our portfolio  as a whole 
the success of these acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired properties into our organization  and apply our business  operating  administrative  financial and accounting strategies and controls to these acquired properties 
depending on the rate of growth of our portfolio  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our management  administrative  accounting and operational systems or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate these properties into our portfolio and manage any future acquisitions of additional properties without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs 
as we develop or acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including tenant retention and mortgage default 
in addition  acquisitions or developments may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention away from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current tenants and employees 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the acquired properties into our operations  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from our acquisitions  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we will acquire multifamily properties only if they meet our criteria and we believe that they will enhance our future financial performance and the value of our portfolio 
our belief  however  is based on and is subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are forward looking and are uncertain in nature or are beyond our control 
in addition  some of these properties may have unknown characteristics or deficiencies or may not complement our portfolio of existing properties 
as a result  some properties may be worth less or may generate less revenue than  or simply not perform as well as  we believed at the time of the acquisition  thereby negatively affecting our operating results 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth 
we may from time to time commence development activities or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if economic conditions warrant and appropriate opportunities arise 
our historical experience in our existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets 
we may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment or for sale residential housing market conditions and local economies  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
risks associated with our indebtedness and financing activities we have substantial indebtedness and our cash flow may not be sufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness or repay our indebtedness as it matures 
we rely on debt financing for our business 
as of december   the amount of our total debt was approximately billion  consisting of billion of consolidated debt and billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt 
due to our high level of debt  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt  and our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon that property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies 
in addition  if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt 
most of our indebtedness does not require significant principal payments prior to maturity 
however  we will need to raise additional equity capital  obtain collateralized or unsecured debt financing  issue private or public debt  or sell some of our assets to either refinance or repay our indebtedness as it matures 
we cannot assure you that 
table of contents these sources of financing or refinancing will be available to us at reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to obtain financing or refinancing to repay our maturing indebtedness  and our inability to refinance existing indebtedness on reasonable terms  may require us to make higher interest and principal payments  issue additional equity securities  or sell some of our assets on disadvantageous terms  all or any of which may result in foreclosure of properties  partial or complete loss on our investment and otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operation 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and have other adverse effects which would negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 
as of december   our consolidated borrowings and pro rata share of unconsolidated borrowings totaled approximately billion of consolidated borrowings and billion of unconsolidated borrowings  which represented approximately of our total market capitalization 
total market capitalization represents the sum of the outstanding indebtedness including our share of joint venture indebtedness  the total liquidation preference of all our preferred shares and the total market value of our common shares and units of partnership interest of our operating partnership  based on the closing price of our common shares as of december  our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the incurrence of debt 
our leverage and any future increases in our leverage could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  make us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns  reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes which would negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 
due to the amount of our variable rate debt  rising interest rates would adversely affect our results of operation 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding  consisting of million of our consolidated debt and million of our pro rata share of variable rate unconsolidated joint venture debt 
while we have sought to refinance our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or cap our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using interest rate swap agreements where appropriate  failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  interest rate swap agreements and other hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  as opportunities arise  we may borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
as a result  a significant increase in interest rates would adversely affect our results of operations 
we have entered into debt agreements with covenants that restrict our operating activities  which could adversely affect our results of operations  and violation of these restrictive covenants could adversely affect our financial condition through debt defaults or acceleration 
our unsecured credit facility contains numerous customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt  including the following financial ratios collateralized debt to total asset value ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  total liabilities to total asset value ratio  total permitted investments to total asset value ratio  and unencumbered leverage ratio 
the indenture under which our senior unsecured debt is issued also contains financial and operating covenants including coverage ratios 
our indenture also limits our ability to incur collateralized and unsecured indebtedness  sell all or substantially all or our assets  and 
table of contents engage in mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
these restrictions  as well as any additional restrictions which we may become subject to in connection with additional financings or refinancings  will continue to hinder our operational flexibility through limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pursue certain business initiatives or make other changes to our business 
these limitations could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  violations of these covenants could cause the declaration of defaults and any related acceleration of indebtedness  which would result in adverse consequences to our financial condition 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and operating covenants under our existing credit facility and indenture  and we believe that we will continue to remain in compliance with these covenants 
however  given the ongoing recession and continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain compliance with these ratios and other debt covenants in the future  particularly if conditions worsen 
our inability to obtain sufficient third party financing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition because we depend on third party financing for our capital needs  including development  expansion  acquisition and other activities 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute to our shareholders each year at least of our reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
because of these distribution requirements  it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs from income from operations 
as a result  when we engage in the development or acquisition of new properties or expansion or redevelopment of existing properties  we will continue to rely on third party sources of capital  including lines of credit  collateralized or unsecured debt both construction financing and permanent debt  and equity issuances 
these sources  however  may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends on a number of factors  including the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings 
moreover  additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of our shareholders interests  and additional debt financing may substantially increase our leverage 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund our current or new development or project expansions or our acquisition activities on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient level of third party financing to fund our capital needs  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain sufficient third party financing for our capital needs  including development  expansion  acquisition and other activities  on reasonable terms or at all and could have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common shares 
the united states stock and credit markets have recently experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing  even for companies who are otherwise qualified to obtain financing 
continued volatility and uncertainty in the stock and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing for our capital needs  including development  expansion  acquisition activities and other purposes at reasonable terms or at all  which may negatively affect our business 
additionally  due to this uncertainty  we may be unable to refinance or extend our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness 
if we are not successful in refinancing this debt when it becomes due  we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain permanent financing on development projects we financed with construction loans or mezzanine debt 
our inability to obtain such permanent financing on favorable terms  if at all  could delay the completion of our development projects and or cause us to incur additional capital costs in connection with completing such projects  either of which could have an adverse affect on our business 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to further adjust our business plan accordingly 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or subordinated notes 
the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and other adverse effects on us and our business 

table of contents our senior notes do not have an established trading market  therefore  holders of our notes may not be able to sell their notes 
each series of our senior notes is a new issue of securities with no established trading market 
we do not intend to apply for listing of any series of notes on any national securities exchange 
the underwriters in an offering of senior notes may advise us that they intend to make a market in the notes  but they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice 
we can give no assurance as to the liquidity of or any trading market for any series of our notes 
a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance in february  standard poor s placed our credit ratings  including our bbb corporate credit rating  on creditwatch with negative implications based on weaker than expected fourth quarter results 
a downgrade in our credit ratings by both standard poor s and moody s  while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under our existing credit facility  could cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facility and also would impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt by increasing borrowing costs and causing shorter borrowing periods  or otherwise limit our access to capital 
risks associated with our organization and structure some of our trustees and officers have conflicts of interest and could exercise influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of our shareholders 
as a result of their substantial ownership of common shares and units  messrs 
thomas lowder  our chairman and chief executive officer  james lowder and harold ripps  each of whom is a trustee  could seek to exert influence over our decisions as to sales or re financings of particular properties we own 
any such exercise of influence could produce decisions that are not in the best interest of all of the holders of interests in us 
the lowder family and their affiliates hold interests in a company that has performed insurance brokerage services with respect to our properties 
this company may perform similar services for us in the future 
as a result  the lowder family may realize benefits from transactions between this company and us that are not realized by other holders of interests in us 
in addition  given their positions with us  thomas lowder  as our chairman and chief executive officer  and james lowder  as a trustee  may be in a position to influence us to do business with companies in which the lowder family has a financial interest 
other than a specific procedure for reviewing and approving related party construction activities  we have not adopted a formal policy for the review and approval of conflict of interest transactions generally 
pursuant to our charter  our audit committee reviews and discusses with management and our independent registered public accounting firm any such transaction if deemed material and relevant to an understanding of our financial statements 
our policies and practices may not be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts 
moreover  transactions with companies controlled by the lowder family  if any  may not be on terms as favorable to us as we could obtain in an arms length transaction with a third party 
restrictions on the acquisition and change in control of the company may have adverse effects on the value of our common shares 
various provisions of our declaration of trust restrict the possibility for acquisition or change in control of us  even if the acquisition or change in control were in the shareholders interest 
as a result  the value of our common shares may be less than they would otherwise be in the absence of such restrictions 
our declaration of trust contains ownership limits and restrictions on transferability 
our declaration of trust contains certain restrictions on the number of common shares and preferred shares that individual shareholders may own  which is intended to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year and the shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year 
to help avoid violating these requirements  our declaration of trust contains provisions restricting the ownership and transfer of shares in certain circumstances 
these 
table of contents ownership limitations provide that no person may beneficially own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  more than  in either number of shares or value whichever is more restrictive  of any class of our outstanding shares  in number or value whichever is more restrictive  of our outstanding common shares and any outstanding excess shares  and in the case of certain excluded holders related to the lowder family by one individual  by two individuals  by three individuals  or by four individuals 
these ownership limitations may be waived by our board of trustees if it receives representations and undertakings of certain facts for the protection of our reit status  and if requested  an irs ruling or opinion of counsel 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our declaration of trust permits the board of trustees to issue up to  preferred shares  having those preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to distributions  qualifications  or terms or conditions of redemption as determined by the board of trustees 
thus  the board of trustees could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which some or a majority of shareholders might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of shares 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other possible anti takeover provisions 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition or change in control of the company  and  as a result could prevent our shareholders from being paid a premium for their common shares over the then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent  the ability to remove trustees only at a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose  by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two thirds of the shares then outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of trustees  the limitation that a special meeting of shareholders can be called only by the president or chairman of the board or upon the written request of shareholders holding outstanding shares representing at least of all votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting  the advance written notice requirement for shareholders to nominate a trustee or submit other business before a meeting of shareholders  and the requirement that the amendment of certain provisions of the declaration of trust relating to the removal of trustees  the termination of the company and any provision that would have the effect of amending these provisions  require the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of the shares then outstanding 
we may change our business policies in the future  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our major policies  including our policies with respect to development  acquisitions  financing  growth  operations  debt capitalization and distributions  are determined by our board of trustees 
a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  including our ability to service debt 
for example  in january  we decided to accelerate our plan to dispose of our for sale residential assets and land held for future for sale residential and mixed use developments and postpone future development activities including previously identified future development projects until we determine that the current economic environment has sufficiently improved 
as a result of this decision  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million  million of abandoned pursuit costs and million of restructuring charges related to a reduction in our development staff and other overhead personnel 
our board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time in the future  and no assurance can be given that additional amendments or revisions to these or other policies will not result in additional charges or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents risks related to our shares market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common shares 
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares  as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective purchasers of our shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for us to distribute and  in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution 
this could cause the market price of our common shares to go down 
in addition  although our common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange  the daily trading volume of our shares may be lower than the trading volume for other industries 
as a result  our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 
a large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and may be dilutive to current shareholders 
the sales of a substantial number of common shares  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares 
in addition to the possibility that we may sell our shares in a public offering at any time  or issue shares pursuant to share option and share purchase plans  as of december  we may issue up to  common shares upon redemption of currently outstanding units 
no prediction can be made about the effect that future distribution or sales of common shares will have on the market price of our common shares 
we may change our dividend policy 
the company intends to continue to declare quarterly distributions on its common shares 
future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the company s board of trustees and the amount and timing of distributions will depend upon cash generated by operating activities  the company s financial condition  capital requirements  annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code  and such other factors as our board of trustees deem relevant 
moreover  in light of recent internal revenue procedure changes  our board of trustees is currently considering paying future distributions to common shareholders  beginning in may  in a combination of common shares and cash 
this dividend and the alternative dividend structure would allow us to retain additional capital  thereby strengthening our balance sheet 
however  our board of trustees reserves the right to pay any future distribution entirely in cash 
our board of trustees reviews the dividend quarterly and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid or that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods 
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to our earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we believe that the market value of a reit s equity securities is based primarily upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions  and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common shares 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet the required payments on our preferred shares and the operating partnership s preferred units 
our failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares 
the stock markets  including the new york stock exchange nyse  on which we list our common shares  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
as a result  the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile  and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  
table of contents actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly operating results  changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts  additions and departures of key personnel  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestments  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours  the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies  an increase in market interest rates  which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds  changes in accounting principles  terrorist acts  and general market conditions  including factors unrelated to our performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
risks associated with income tax laws our failure to qualify as a reit would decrease the funds available for distribution to our shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december  we intend to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit  but we cannot assure shareholders that we will qualify as a reit 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we qualify as a reit  and the statements in this form k are not binding on the irs or any court 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our shareholders 
many of the reit requirements are highly technical and complex 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within our control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
we generally are prohibited from owning more than of the voting securities or more than of the value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer  subject to certain exceptions  including an exception with respect to certain debt instruments and corporations electing to be taxable reit subsidiaries 
we are also required to distribute to shareholders at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that we hold most of our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress or the internal revenue service might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  or the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to remain qualified as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the internal revenue code  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
as a taxable corporation  we would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income or pass through long term capital gains to individual shareholders at favorable rates 
we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 
we would not be able to elect to be taxed as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify unless the irs were to grant us relief under certain statutory provisions 
if we failed to qualify as a reit  we would have to pay significant income taxes  which would reduce our net earnings available for investment or 
table of contents distribution to our shareholders 
this likely would have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and the value of our common shares 
in addition  we would no longer be required to pay any distributions to shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the statutory savings provisions in order to maintain our reit status  we would nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of at least  or more for each such failure 
moreover  our failure to qualify as a reit also would cause an event of default under our credit facility and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and to service our debt 
even if we qualify as a reit  we will be required to pay some taxes particularly related to our taxable reit subsidiary 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income including capital gains 
moreover  if we have net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
however  we will not be treated as a dealer in real property with respect to a property that we sell for the purposes of the tax if i we have held the property for at least two years for the production of rental income prior to the sale  ii capitalized expenditures on the property in the two years preceding the sale are less than of the net selling price of the property  and iii we either a have seven or fewer sales of property excluding certain property obtained through foreclosure for the year of sale or b the aggregate tax basis of property sold during the year of sale is or less of the aggregate tax basis of all of our assets as of the beginning of the taxable year or c the fair market value of the property sold during the year of sale is or less of the aggregate fair market value of all of our assets as of the beginning of the taxable year and in the case of b or c  substantially all of the marketing and development expenditures with respect to the property sold are made through an independent contractor from whom we derive no income 
the sale of more than one property to one buyer as part of one transaction constitutes one sale for purposes of this safe harbor 
we intend to hold our properties  and crlp intends to hold its properties  for investment with a view to long term appreciation  to engage in the business of acquiring  developing  owning and operating properties  and to make occasional sales of properties as are consistent with our investment objectives 
however  not all of our sales will satisfy the safe harbor requirements described above 
furthermore  there are certain interpretive issues related to the application of the safe harbor that are not free from doubt under the federal income tax law 
while we acquire and hold our properties with an investment objective and do not believe they constitute dealer property  we cannot provide any assurance that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the penalty tax or that the irs would not challenge our interpretation of  or any reliance on  the safe harbor provisions 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable reit subsidiaries  or through entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities separate from our taxable reit subsidiaries  will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax 
we have elected to treat colonial properties services  inc as a taxable reit subsidiary  and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrangements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income because not all states and localities treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  we will have less cash available for distributions to our shareholders 
reit distribution requirements may increase our indebtedness 
we may be required from time to time  under certain circumstances  to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received 
in such event  or upon our repayment of principal on debt  we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit 

table of contents accordingly  we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 
tax elections regarding distributions may impact our future liquidity 
under certain circumstances  we may make a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year 
this election may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year 
however  this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability

we intend to continue to declare quarterly distributions on our common shares 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must make annual distributions to shareholders of at least of our taxable income

moreover  in light of recent internal revenue procedure changes  our board of trustees is currently considering paying future distributions to common shareholders  beginning in may  in a combination of common shares and cash 
this dividend and the alternative dividend structure would allow us to retain additional capital  thereby strengthening our balance sheet

table of contents funds from operations ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  means income loss before minority interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciated property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
we believe that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and gains or losses from sales of properties all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
ffo is a widely recognized measure in the company s industry 
we believe that the line on its consolidated statement of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
in addition to company management evaluating the operating performance of its reportable segments based on ffo results  management uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to key employees 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo should not be considered a as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  b as an indicator of financial performance  c as cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or d as a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs  including our ability to make distributions 
total market capitalization is defined as the market value of outstanding common shares of the company and operating partnership units of crlp  plus the market value of preferred equity and outstanding principal balance of consolidated debt of the company

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations should be read together except as otherwise noted  with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto contained in item of this form k 
general as described above  under item business business strategy  in june and july  we completed our strategic initiative to become a multifamily focused reit 
as of december   we owned or maintained a partial ownership in multifamily apartment communities containing a total of  apartment units consisting of wholly owned consolidated properties and properties partially owned through unconsolidated joint venture entities aggregating  and  units  respectively  office properties containing a total of approximately million square feet of office space consisting of three wholly owned consolidated properties and properties partially owned through unconsolidated joint venture entities aggregating and million square feet  respectively  retail properties containing a total of approximately million square feet of retail space  excluding anchor owned square footage consisting of six wholly owned properties and properties partially owned through unconsolidated joint venture entities aggregating million and million square feet  respectively  and certain parcels of land adjacent to or near certain of these properties 
as of december   consolidated multifamily  office and retail properties that had achieved stabilized occupancy which occurs once a property has attained physical occupancy were  and leased  respectively 
we are the direct general partner of  and as of december   held approximately of the interests in  colonial realty limited partnership  a delaware limited partnership crlp 
we conduct all of our business through crlp  colonial properties services limited partnership cpslp  which provides management services for our properties  and colonial properties services  inc cpsi  which provides management services for properties owned by third parties 
as a lessor  the majority of our revenue is derived from residents and tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge to our residents and tenants  and the ability of these residents and tenants to make their rental payments 
we also receive third party 
table of contents management fees generated from third party management agreements related to management of properties held in joint ventures 
business strategy and outlook we continue to experience a global financial and economic crisis  which has included  among other things  significant reductions and disruptions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit  substantial reductions and or volatility in equity values worldwide  and concerns that the weakening us and worldwide economies may enter into a prolonged recessionary period 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases have resulted in the unavailability of financing even for companies who are otherwise qualified to obtain financing 
in addition  the weakening economy and mounting job losses in the us  and the slowdown in the overall us housing market  resulting in increased supply  have led to deterioration in the multifamily market 
the turmoil in the credit and capital markets  continuing job losses and our expectation that the economy will to continue to remain weak or weaken further before we see any improvements have caused us to recalibrate our business plan 
our outlook for reflects a challenging year 
we have renewed our focus on liquidity  maintaining a strong balance sheet  addressing our near term debt maturities  managing our existing properties and operating our portfolio efficiently and reducing our overhead 
to help implement our plans to strengthen the balance sheet and deleverage the company  our board of trustees decided to accelerate plans to dispose of our for sale residential assets including condominium conversions and land held for future sale and for sale residential and mixed use developments 
we also significantly reduced our development pipeline during  including postponing future development activities until we determine that the current economic environment has sufficiently improved 
as a result of these decisions  as discussed further below  we incurred a non cash impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of as discussed further below  in light of recent internal revenue procedure changes  our board of trustees is currently considering paying future distributions to common shareholders  beginning in may  in a combination of common shares and cash 
this dividend and the alternative dividend structure would allow us to retain additional capital  thereby strengthening our balance sheet 
however  our board of trustees reserves the right to pay any future distribution entirely in cash 
our board of trustees reviews the dividend quarterly and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid or that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods 
we also intend to look for opportunities to repurchase additional outstanding unsecured senior notes and series d preferred depositary shares at appropriate prices and as circumstances warrant 
these actions are intended to streamline the business and allow us to further concentrate on our multifamily strategy 
we believe that our business strategy  the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities  limited debt maturities in  the number of unencumbered properties in our multifamily portfolio and the additional financing through fannie mae expected to be obtained in the first quarter of  has us positioned to work through this challenging economic environment 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
our current projections indicate that we will be able to operate in compliance with these covenants in and beyond 
however  if the real estate market continues to decline  if we fail to meet our operational budget  and or if we are unable to successfully execute our plans as further described below  we could violate these covenants  and as a result may be subject to higher finance costs and fees and or accelerated maturities 
as mentioned elsewhere herein  we have adopted a plan which focuses on lowering leverage and increasing financial flexibility 
we intend to prudently manage and minimize discretionary operating and capital expenditures and raising the necessary debt and equity capital to maximize liquidity  repay outstanding borrowings as they mature and comply with financial covenants in as mentioned previously  we also intend to raise additional capital through the issuance of collateralized financings of up to million through fannie mae and or freddie mac and asset sales 
in addition  and as the market allows  the company may contemplate strategically repurchasing its publicly traded unsecured debt at a discount to par and may consider paying a portion of the quarterly dividends with common shares  both of which should result in improvement of our financial covenant ratios 
we believe we have reasonably projected our operations for financial covenant purposes  as well as considered other viable alternatives and contingencies to address our objectives of reducing leverage and continuing 
table of contents to comply with our covenants 
however  the current volatility in the real estate market renders it at least possible that we may not be able to remain compliant with our covenants in executive summary of results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and the operating results summary included below 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for the same period in in addition to our results from operations  results for the period include a non cash impairment charge of million million included in continuing operations  included in discontinued operations  related to certain of our for sale residential properties and land held for future sale and for sale and mixed use development  and one retail development property  million of gains from the repurchase of unsecured senior notes  million of gains from the disposition of assets  and the write off of million of abandoned pursuit costs

as a result  for  we have experienced greater pricing pressure  which in turn  has slowed our rental rate growth 
results for the year ended were driven by growth in austin and dallas fort worth  texas  raleigh and charlotte  north carolina  richmond  virginia  and huntsville and birmingham  alabama 
during the last half of  we have experienced slower traffic trends and job losses in our markets  which led to declining growth trends that we expect to continue in operating revenues and expenses associated with our office and retail assets decreased primarily due to the office and retail joint venture transactions that were consummated during june  and the outright sale of retail assets during  we repurchased million of unsecured senior notes in separate transactions at an average of discount of to par value 
we recognized an aggregate gain of approximately million from these transactions  net of issuance costs  we repurchased  of our outstanding series d preferred depositary shares for an aggregate purchase price of million at a discount to the liquidation preference price

for sale and development activity for sale real estate and land held for development valuation to help implement our plans to strengthen our balance sheet and deleverage the company  in january  our board of trustees decided to accelerate plans to dispose of our for sale residential assets including condominium conversions and land held for future sale and for sale residential and mixed use developments 
as discussed above in item impairment  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the decision in january the impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value of each property and our current book value and the estimated costs to complete 
we also incurred million of abandoned pursuit costs and million of restructuring charges related to a reduction in our development staff and other overhead personnel 
we calculate the fair values of each for sale residential and land held for development project evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
based on current market conditions and assumptions made by management  which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions continue to deteriorate or improve 
specific facts and circumstances of each project are evaluated  including local market conditions  traffic  sales velocity  relative pricing  and cost structure 
with respect to our colonial promenade nord du lac retail development  we are reviewing various alternatives for this development  and have reclassified the amount spent to date from an active development to a future development 
the estimated fair value of this asset was calculated based upon our intent to sell this property upon stabilization  current assumptions regarding rental rates  costs to complete  lease up  holding period and the estimated sales price 
we will continue to monitor the specific facts and circumstances at our for sale properties and development projects 
if market conditions do not improve or if there is further market deterioration  it may impact the number of projects we can sell  the timing of the sales and or the prices at which we can sell them in future periods 
if we are unable to sell projects  we may incur additional impairment charges on projects previously impaired as well as on projects not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may exist  which would decrease the value of our assets as reflected on our balance sheet and adversely affect net income and shareholders equity 
there can be no assurances of the amount or pace of future for sale residential sales and closings  particularly given current market conditions 
other development activities as noted above  we have postponed future development activities including previously identified future development projects 
we do not plan to start new developments until we determine that the current economic environment has sufficiently improved 
as a result of the decision to postpone future development activities including previously identified future development projects  we incurred million of abandoned pursuit costs 
we also incurred million of restructuring charges related to a reduction in our development staff and other overhead personnel  which are currently anticipated to result in costs savings in of approximately million 
we expect to invest approximately million to million to complete projects currently under construction 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows contained in item of this form k 

table of contents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the comparable prior year period due to the improved operating performance of our fully stabilized communities  the recently introduced bulk cable program and favorable changes in the working capital components ie  decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets coupled with increases in accounts payable  partially offset by prepayment penalties of million paid in in  we expect cash flows from operating activities to be consistent with or slightly less than primarily driven by the challenging economic environment and a projected decrease in our core multifamily operations  which we expect to be partially offset by reduced overhead expenses 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided of million for the comparable prior year period 
the change was primarily due to the disposition activity as a result of the office and retail joint venture transactions that occurred in june in addition  the million decrease in repayments of notes receivable and the million decrease in distributions from unconsolidated entities was primarily a result of debt proceeds received from the office and retail joint ventures during the year ended december  in  we expect cash used in investing activities to substantially decrease as we have decided to accelerate our plan to dispose of our for sale residential assets including condominium conversions and land held for future sale and for sale residential and mixed use developments  and as a result of reduced expenditures attributable to our development pipeline due to our decision to postpone future development activities including previously indentified future development projects 
in addition  during february  we disposed of colonial promenade at fultondale 
the proceeds from this sale were used to reduce the amount outstanding on our unsecured credit facility 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the comparable prior year period 
the decrease was primarily due to million used to fund a special distribution following completion of the office and retail joint venture transactions in june and million excluding the write off of issuance costs for the redemption of series e preferred depositary shares during the remaining change is attributable to the net change in the revolving credit facility balance  the repurchase of million of unsecured senior notes and the issuance of million of secured mortgages during  which was offset by million of cash used to repurchase series d preferred depositary shares in privately negotiated transactions during the year ended december  for  we believe that our business strategy  the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities  limited debt maturities in  the number of unencumbered properties in our multifamily portfolio and the additional financing through fannie mae expected to be obtained in the first quarter of has us positioned to work through this challenging economic environment 
this liquidity  along with our projected asset sales  is expected to allow us to execute our plan in the short term  without having to access the capital markets in short term liquidity needs our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items  capital expenditures incurred to lease our space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our outstanding debt  and quarterly distributions that we pay to our common and preferred shareholders and holders of partnership units in crlp 
in the past  we have primarily satisfied these requirements through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our unsecured credit facility 
the majority of our revenue is derived from residents and tenants under existing leases  primarily at our multifamily properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants and residents  and the ability of these tenants and residents to make their rental payments 
the weakening economy and mounting job losses in the us  and the slowdown in the overall us housing market  which has resulted in increased supply and deterioration in the multifamily market generally  could adversely affect 
table of contents the our ability to lease our multifamily properties as well as the rents we are able to charge and thereby adversely affect our revenues 
we believe that cash generated from operations and dispositions of assets and borrowings under our unsecured credit facility will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements in however  factors described below and elsewhere herein may have a material adverse effect on our future cash flow 
we will continue to review liquidity sufficiency  as well as events that could affect our credit ratings and our ability to access the capital markets and our credit facilities 
while we have no immediate need to access the capital or credit markets at this time  the volatility and liquidity disruptions in the capital and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or subordinated notes or through private financings and may create additional risks in the upcoming months and possibly years 
a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of financing potentially less attractive than our current financing  and may require us to further adjust our business plan accordingly 
we have made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with our taxable year ending december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  development projects that we undertake and costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at that time  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings through public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of collateralized and unsecured debt  sales of common and preferred shares  capital raised through the disposition of assets and joint venture capital transactions 
while the current market conditions for public offerings of unsecured debt and equity are unfavorable  we believe these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs 
given our availability of our credit facilities  limited debt maturities in  the number of unencumbered properties in our multifamily portfolio and the additional financing through fannie mae expected to be obtained in the first quarter of  we expect to be able to meet our short term needs without having to access the public capital markets in however  factors described below and elsewhere herein may have a material adverse effect on our continued access to these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our unencumbered assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
as discussed further below in item credit ratings  we currently have investment grade ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from three major rating agencies 
if we experienced a credit downgrade  we may be limited in our access to capital in the unsecured debt market  which we have historically utilized to fund investment activities  and the interest rate we are paying under our existing credit facility would increase 
our ability to raise funds through sales of common shares and preferred shares is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our shares 
the current financial and economic crisis and significant deterioration in the stock and credit markets have resulted in significant price volatility  which have caused market prices of many stocks  including the price of our common shares  to fluctuate substantially and have adversely affected the market value of our common shares 
with respect to both debt and equity  a prolonged downturn in the financial markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or subordinated notes or through private financings 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity and credit markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive 

table of contents over the last few years  we have maintained our asset recycling program  which helps us to maximize our investment returns through the sale of assets that have reached their investment potential and reinvest the proceeds into opportunities with more growth potential 
during  we sold six wholly owned multifamily apartment communities consisting of  units 
we also sold our ownership interests in seven multifamily apartment communities consisting of  units 
in addition to the sale of these multifamily apartment communities  during  we sold one office asset consisting of  square feet  our interest in another office asset consisting of  square feet and our ownership interest in the gpt colonial retail joint venture representing approximately million square feet including anchor owned square footage 
sales proceeds of approximately million  including our pro rata share of disposition proceeds for our interests in partially owned properties  were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our unsecured line of credit  to repay mortgages associated with the properties  to fund general corporate purposes and to fund other investment opportunities 
in addition  as a result of the re evaluation of our operating strategy as it relates to its for sale residential properties and condominium conversions  land held for future sale and for sale residential and mixed use developments and retail development activities  we have decided to accelerate our plans to dispose of our for sale residential assets including condominium conversions and land held for future sale and for sale residential and mixed use developments 
our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to reits 
our ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash is expected to be limited based on current market conditions 
for example  we may not be able to sell a property or properties as quickly as we have in the past or on terms as favorable as we have previously received 
moreover  for sale residential properties under development or acquired for development usually generate little or no cash flow until completion of development and sale of a significant number of homes or condominium units and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion and until such homes or condominium units are sold 
at december   our total outstanding debt balance was billion 
the outstanding balance includes fixed rate debt of billion  or of the total debt balance  and floating rate debt of million  or of the total debt balance 
our total market capitalization as of december  was billion and our ratio of total outstanding indebtedness to market capitalization was 
as further discussed below  at december   we had an unsecured revolving credit facility providing for total borrowings of up to million and a cash management line providing for borrowings up to million 
distributions the dividend on our common shares was per share per quarter for the first three quarters of and per share for the fourth quarter of  or per share during the reduced dividend will allow us to retain more capital  thereby improving our balance sheet 
we also pay regular quarterly dividends on our preferred shares and units 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of our board of trustees  our ability to pay dividends under alabama law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to shareholders 
we also make regular quarterly distributions on units in our operating partnership 
moreover  in light of recent internal revenue procedure changes  our board of trustees is currently considering paying future distributions to common shareholders  beginning in may  in a combination of common shares and cash 
this dividend and the alternative dividend structure would allow us to retain additional capital  thereby strengthening our balance sheet 
however  our board of trustees reserves the right to pay any future distribution entirely in cash 
our board of trustees reviews the dividend quarterly  and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid or that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods 
collateralized credit facility during the first quarter of  we expect to lock an all in interest rate of on a year  million credit facility to be originated by pnc arcs llc and repurchased by fannie mae nyse fnm 
in connection with this rate lock  we posted a deposit equal to of the loan amount subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances if we do not complete the financing transaction 
this credit facility will be collateralized by multifamily properties 
the proceeds from this credit facility are expected to be used to pay down outstanding 
table of contents borrowings on our unsecured credit facility  provide liquidity that can be used toward completion of the remaining ongoing developments and provide additional funding for our unsecured bond repurchase program 
in addition to the fannie mae facility  we are continuing negotiations with fannie mae or freddie mac nyse fre to provide additional financing of up to million with respect to certain of our existing other multifamily properties 
proceeds received from additional financing transactions would be used to provide additional liquidity for our unsecured bond repurchase program and to provide liquidity for our debt maturities through however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate any of these additional financing arrangements 
unsecured revolving credit facility during january  we added million of additional borrowing capacity through the accordion feature of our unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility with wachovia bank  national association  a subsidiary of wells fargo company wachovia  as agent for the lenders  bank of america  na as syndication agent  wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  citicorp north america  inc and regions bank  as co documentation agents  and us bank national association and pnc bank  national association  as co senior managing agents and other lenders named therein 
as of december   crlp  with the trust as guarantor  has a million credit facility 
the amended credit facility has a maturity date of june  base rate loans and revolving loans are available under the credit facility 
the credit facility also includes a competitive bid feature that allows us to convert up to million under the credit facility to a fixed rate and for a fixed term not to exceed days 
generally  base rate loans bear interest at wachovia s designated base rate  plus a base rate margin ranging up to based on our unsecured debt ratings from time to time 
revolving loans bear interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to based on our unsecured debt ratings 
competitive bid loans bear interest at libor plus a margin  as specified by the participating lenders 
based on crlp s current unsecured debt rating  the revolving loans currently bear interest at a rate of libor plus basis points 
included in the credit facility  we have a million cash management line provided by wachovia that will expire on june  the cash management line had an outstanding balance of million as of december  the credit facility and cash management line  which is primarily used to finance property acquisitions and developments  had an outstanding balance at december  of million 
the interest rate of the credit facility was and at december  and  respectively 
the credit facility contains various restrictions  representations  covenants and events of default that could preclude future borrowings including future issuances of letters of credit or trigger early repayment obligations  including  but not limited to the following nonpayment  violation or breach of certain covenants  failure to perform certain covenants beyond a cure period  failure to satisfy certain financial ratios  a material adverse change in the consolidated financial condition  results of operations  our business or prospects  and generally not paying our debts as they become due 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
specific financial ratios with which we must comply pursuant to the credit facility consist of the fixed charge coverage ratio as well as the debt to total asset value ratio 
both of these ratios are measured quarterly 
the fixed charge ratio generally requires that our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization be at least equal to times our fixed charges 
fixed charges generally include interest payments including capitalized interest and preferred dividends 
the debt to total asset value ratio generally requires our debt to be less than of its total asset value 
we do not anticipate any events of noncompliance with either of these ratios in  however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to remain in compliance with these covenants particularly given the ongoing recession and continued uncertainty in the stock and credit markets 
as described above  many of the recent disruptions in the financial markets have been brought about in large part by failures in the us banking system 
if wachovia or any of the other financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us under the credit facility or otherwise are adversely affected by the conditions of the financial markets  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to us under the credit facility  the cash management line or otherwise 
if our lenders become unable to fund our borrowings 
table of contents pursuant to their commitments to us  we may need to obtain replacement financing  and such financing  if available  may not be available on commercially attractive terms

on october   our board of trustees authorized a repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up to an additional million of our outstanding series d preferred depositary shares over a month period 
the series d preferred depositary may be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions  subject to applicable legal requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific amounts of preferred shares  and repurchases pursuant to the program may be suspended or resumed at any time without further notice or announcement 
we will continue to monitor the equity markets and repurchase preferred shares if the repurchases meet our required criteria  as funds are available 
if we were to repurchase outstanding series d depositary shares  we would expect to record additional non cash charges related to the write off of series d preferred issuance costs 
unsecured senior note repurchases in january  our board of trustees authorized us to repurchase up to million of outstanding unsecured senior notes of crlp

investing activities during  we acquired the remaining interest in one multifamily apartment community containing units for an aggregate cost of million  which consisted of the assumption of million of existing mortgage debt million of which was previously unconsolidated as a partner and million of cash 
we completed the development of seven wholly owned multifamily apartment communities and one partially owned multifamily apartment community for million  which represents our cost for the seven wholly owned developments and our portion of the cost for the partially owned development 
also  we completed the development of five commercial assets  consisting of two wholly owned office assets  totaling million square feet  and two wholly owned retail assets and one partially owned retail asset  totaling million square feet  excluding anchor owned square feet  for an aggregate cost of million

we regularly incur significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of our office and retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on the particular market and the negotiations with tenants 
we also incur expenditures for certain recurring capital expenses 
during  we incurred approximately million related to tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and approximately million of recurring capital expenditures

credit ratings our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency rating last update fitch bbb april  moody s baa november  standard poor s bbb february  ratings outlook is stable 
ratings outlook is negative 
in february  standard poor s placed our ratings  including our bbb corporate credit rating  on creditwatch with negative implications based on our weaker than expected fourth quarter results 
during  standard and poor s revised its outlook from stable to negative based on our debt service coverage metrics 
during november  moody s announced that it affirmed our outlook and credit rating 
our credit ratings are investment grade 
if we experience a credit downgrade  we may be limited in our access to capital in the unsecured debt market  which we have historically utilized to fund our investment activities 
in addition  as previously discussed  our spread on our unsecured credit facility would increase 

table of contents market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes that could affect our results of operations and financial condition or cash flow 
we limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of derivative instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
however  interest rate swap agreements and other hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes at december  estimated fair thereafter total value in thousands fixed rate debt average interest rate at december  variable debt average interest rate at december  n a n a n a n a the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding floating rate debt 
we do not believe that the interest rate risk represented by our floating rate debt is material in relation to our billion of outstanding total debt and our billion of total assets as of december  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains approximately million  the balance as of december  our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps including forward starting interest rate swaps and caps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
as of december   we had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
at december  and  there were no derivatives included in other assets 
at december   derivatives with a fair value of million were included in other assets 
there was no change in net unrealized gains losses in the change in net unrealized gains losses of million in and million in for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is separately disclosed in the statements of changes in shareholders equity and comprehensive income 
at december  and  there were no derivatives that were not designated as hedges 
the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges of million is included in other income expense in there was no hedge ineffectiveness during and hedge ineffectiveness of million on cash flow hedges due to index mismatches was recognized in other income during as of december   all of our hedges are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense and debt cost amortization as interest payments are made on our hedged debt or to gains losses on hedging activities at such time that the interest payments on the hedged debt become no longer probable 
table of contents to occur as originally specified 
a portion of the interest payments on the hedged debt became no longer probable to occur as a result of our bond repurchase program see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income for reclassifications to interest expense and debt cost amortization tied to interest payments made on the hedged debt was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income for reclassification to gains losses on hedging activities related to interest payments on the hedged debt that have been deemed no longer probable to occur as a result of repurchases under our senior note repurchase program was million during  with no impact during and during may  we settled a million interest rate swap and received a payment of approximately million 
this interest rate swap was in place to convert a portion of the floating rate payments on our credit facility to a fixed rate 
this derivative originally qualified for hedge accounting under sfas no 
however  in may of  due to our then pending joint venture transactions see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k and the expected resulting pay down of our term loan and credit facility  this derivative no longer qualified for hedge accounting which resulted in a gain of approximately million 
during february  we settled a million forward starting interest rate swap and received a payment of approximately million 
this forward starting interest rate swap was in place to convert the floating rate payments on certain expected future debt obligations to a fixed rate 
this derivative originally qualified for hedge accounting under sfas no 
however  in december of as a result of a modification to the forecasted transaction  this derivative no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
as a result  we began treating this derivative as an economic hedge during changes in the fair value of this derivative were recognized in earnings in other income expense and totaled approximately million for the period of time the derivative was active during the fair value of this derivative at the time it no longer qualified for hedge accounting was approximately million  which will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income and be reclassified to interest expense over the applicable period of the associated debt  which is approximately eight years at december  during june  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a forecasted debt issuance that occurred on august  this interest rate swap agreement had a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of  and a maturity date of november  this interest rate swap agreement was settled concurrent with our issuance of million of debt in the senior notes offering completed august  see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the settlement resulted in a settlement payment of approximately million 
this amount will remain in other comprehensive income and be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining term of the associated debt  which is approximately eight years at december  on august   we also entered into a million treasury lock agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the remaining million of senior notes issued on august  this treasury lock agreement was settled on august  for a settlement payment of approximately million which will also remain in other comprehensive income and be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining life of the associated debt 
during november  we settled a million forward starting interest rate swap and received a payment of approximately million 
this forward starting interest rate swap was in place to convert the floating rate payments on certain expected future debt obligations to a fixed rate 
in november of  we settled this forward starting swap agreement as a result of its determination that the forecasted debt issuance was no longer probable due to our strategic shift see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
in december  we made the determination that it was probable that the forecasted debt issuance would not occur 
as a result  we reversed the million in other comprehensive income to other income during december of further  we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives

the contractor is affiliated with our joint venture partner 
in connection with the dispute  in january  the contractor filed a lawsuit against us alleging  among other things  breach of contract  enforcement of a lien against real property  misrepresentation  conversion  declaratory judgment and an accounting of costs  and is seeking million in damages  plus consequential and punitive damages 
certain of the subcontractors  vendors and other parties  involved in the projects  including purchasers of units  have also made claims in the form of lien claims  general claims or lawsuits 
we have been sued by purchasers of certain condominium units alleging breach of contract  fraud  construction deficiencies and misleading sales practices 
both compensatory and punitive damages are sought in these actions 
some of these claims have been resolved by negotiations and mediations  and others may also be similarly resolved 
some of these claims will likely be arbitrated or litigated to conclusion 
we are continuing to evaluate our options and investigate these claims  including possible claims against the contractor and other parties 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims 
however  no prediction of the likelihood  or amount  of any resulting loss or recovery can be made at this time and no assurance can be given that the matter will be resolved favorably 
in connection with certain retail developments  we have received funding from municipalities for infrastructure costs 
in most cases  the municipalities issue bonds that are repaid primarily from sales tax revenues generated from the tenants at each respective development 
we have guaranteed the shortfall  if any  of tax revenues to the debt service requirements on the bonds 
the total amount outstanding on these bonds was approximately million

the funds from this bond issuance will be used by the cdd to construct infrastructure for the benefit of the colonial pinnacle nord du lac development 
in accordance with eitf  we have recorded restricted cash and other liabilities for the million bond issuance 
this transaction has been treated as a non cash transaction in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the twelve months ended december  during  we sold land for million to the cdd for the construction of infrastructure  resulting in a million decrease in restricted cash 
as previously discussed  we have postponed future development activities  including this development and have reclassified the amount spent to date from an active development to a future development 
interest payments on the bonds for will be made from a capitalized interest account funded with bond proceeds 
thereafter  repayment of the bonds will be funded by special assessments on the property owner s within the cdd 
the first special assessment is expected to be due on or about december  as the property owner  we intended to fund the special assessments from payments by tenants in the development 
until colonial pinnacle nord du lac is developed and leased  it is not expected to generate sufficient tenant revenues to support the full amount of the special assessments  in which case we would be obligated pay the special assessments to the extent not funded through tenant payments 
the special assessments are not a personal liability of the property owner  but constitute a lien on the assessed property 
in the event of a failure to pay the special assessments  the cdd would have the right to force the sale of the property included in the project 
we are continuing to evaluate various alternatives for this development

summary of critical accounting policies we believe our accounting policies are in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been

we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our reported operating results principles of consolidation we consolidate entities in which we have a controlling interest or entities where we are determined to be the primary beneficiary under fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
under fin r  variable interest entities vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes 
additionally  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partner as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights provides guidance in determining whether a general partner controls and  therefore  should consolidate a limited partnership 
the application of fin r and eitf no 
requires management to make significant estimates and judgments about our and our partners rights  obligations and economic interests in such entities 
where we have less than a controlling financial interest in an entity or we are not the primary beneficiary of the entity under fin r  the entity is accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  our share of the net earnings or losses of these entities is included in consolidated net income 
a description of our investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting is included in note investments in partially owned entities and other arrangements in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
we recognize minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets for partially owned entities that we consolidate 
the minority partners share of current operations is reflected in minority interest of limited partners in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
land  buildings  and equipment land  buildings  and equipment is stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated depreciation  or fair value 
we review our long lived assets and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value 
assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine fair value based on a probability weighted discounted future cash flow analysis 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  land inventory and for sale residential projects under development are reviewed for potential write downs when impairment indicators are present 
sfas no 
requires that in the event the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts  impairment charges are required to be recorded to the extent that the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by estimates of sales price  selling velocity  sales incentives  construction costs  and other factors 
due to uncertainties in the estimation process  actual results could differ from such estimates 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is to be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our determination of fair value is based on a probability weighted discounted future cash flow analysis  current negotiations regarding a potential sale or other related factors  all of which incorporate available market information as well as other assumptions made by management 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows useful lives buildings years furniture and fixtures or years equipment or years land improvements or years tenant improvements life of lease 
table of contents repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred 
replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets 
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of in place leases and value of other tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
we consider acquisitions of operating real estate assets to be businesses as that term is contemplated in emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether a non monetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
we allocate purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes the land and building determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land and buildings based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
we also allocate value to tenant improvements based on the estimated costs of similar tenants with similar terms 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other intangible assets acquired are measured based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
management may engage independent third party appraisers to perform these valuations and those appraisals use commonly employed valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods depending on specific local market conditions and depending on the type of property acquired 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in place leases  which includes other tenant relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement or management s expectation for renewal  among other factors 
from time to time  we pursue acquisition opportunities and will not be successful in all cases 
costs incurred related to these acquisition opportunities are expensed when it is no longer probable that we will be successful in the acquisition 
undeveloped land and construction in progress undeveloped land and construction in progress is stated at cost unless such assets are impaired pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 in which case such assets are recorded at fair value 
costs incurred during predevelopment are capitalized after we have identified a development site  determined that a project is feasible and concluded that it is probable that the project will proceed 
while we believe we will recover this capital through the successful development of such projects  it is possible that a write off of 
table of contents unrecoverable amounts could occur 
once it is no longer probable that a development will be successful  the predevelopment costs that have been previously capitalized are expensed 
the capitalization of costs during the development of assets including interest  property taxes and other direct costs begins when an active development commences and ends when the asset  or a portion of an asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
cost capitalization during redevelopment of assets including interest and other direct costs begins when the asset is taken out of service for redevelopment and ends when the asset redevelopment is completed and the asset is placed in service 
valuation of receivables due to the short term nature of the leases at our multifamily properties  generally six months to one year  our exposure to tenant defaults and bankruptcies is minimized 
our policy is to record allowances for all outstanding receivables greater than days past due at our multifamily properties 
we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies at our office and retail properties that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform credit review and analysis on all commercial tenants and significant leases before they are executed 
we evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables and record allowances as appropriate 
our policy is to record allowances for all outstanding invoices greater than days past due at our office and retail properties 
we had million and million in an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and  respectively 
notes receivable notes receivable consists primarily of promissory notes issued by third parties 
we record notes receivable at cost 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal for each of its notes to determine whether it is impaired 
a note is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a note is considered to be impaired  the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the note s effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral if the note is collateral dependent 
notes receivable activity for the twelve months ended december  consists primarily of the following we had a promissory note of approximately million related to a for sale residential project in which we had a interest 
during  the regents park joint venture defaulted on this note 
as a result  we converted the outstanding notes receivable due from the regents park joint venture phase i to preferred equity in the same joint venture 
we did not record a gain or loss upon conversion of the outstanding notes receivable balance to preferred equity 
because of these events  we have consolidated this joint venture in its financial statements as of december  see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we had short term seller financing related to the sale of colonial grand at shelby farms i ii for approximately million with an original maturity date of july  and a rate of 
there were two day extension options available at a rate of and  respectively 
during july  the buyer exercised the first of these extension options 
in august  the buyer repaid the note in full 
we had recorded accrued interest related to our outstanding notes receivable of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
as of december   and  we had recorded a reserve of million  million and million  respectively  against its outstanding notes receivable and accrued interest 
the weighted average interest rate on the notes receivable outstanding at december   and was approximately  and  respectively 
interest income is recognized on an accrual basis 
we provided first mortgage financing to third parties in as discussed above 
in  we provided first mortgage financing to third parties of million and received principal payments of million on these loans 
we provided million million of subordinated financing and million of seller financing of financing to third parties in and million of subordinated financing to third parties in we received principal payments of million and million on these and other outstanding subordinated loans during and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had outstanding notes receivable balances of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had a reserve of million related to these notes 

table of contents deferred debt and lease costs deferred debt costs consist of loan fees and related expenses which are amortized on a straight line basis  which approximates the effective interest method  over the terms of the related debt 
deferred lease costs include leasing charges  direct salaries and other costs incurred by us to originate a lease  which are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
derivative instruments all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
subsequently amended by sfas nos 
and  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  must be recorded at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we enter into derivative financial instruments from time to time  but do not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates on variable rate debt 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedge transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in hedging the exposure to the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed 
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting if a derivative is not determined to be highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge 
share based compensation we currently sponsor share option plans and restricted share award plans refer to note share based compensation in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which replaced sfas no

revenue recognition sales and the associated gains or losses on real estate assets  condominium conversion projects and for sale residential projects are recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
for condominium conversion and for sale residential projects  sales and the associated gains for individual condominium units are recognized upon the closing of the sale transactions  as all conditions for full profit recognition have been met completed contract method 
under sfas no 
 we use the relative sales value method to allocate costs and recognize profits from condominium conversion and for sale residential sales 
estimated future warranty costs on condominium conversion and for sale residential sales are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from such sales are recognized 
such estimated warranty costs are approximately of total revenue 
as necessary  additional warranty costs are charged to costs of sales based on management s estimate of the costs to remediate existing claims 
revenue from construction contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
adjustments to estimated profits on contracts are recognized in the period in which such adjustments become known 
other income received from long term contracts signed in the normal course of business  including property management and development fee income  is recognized when earned for services provided to third parties  including joint ventures in which we own a minority interest 
we  as lessor  retain substantially all the risks and benefits of property ownership and account for our leases as operating leases 
rental income attributable to leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
certain leases contain provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of tenant sales 
percentage rents are recognized in the period in which sales thresholds are met 
recoveries from tenants for taxes  insurance  and other property operating expenses are recognized in the period the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the terms of the related lease 
segment reporting we have adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
defines an operating segment as a component of an enterprise that engages in 
table of contents business activities that generate revenues and incur expenses  which operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in the determination of resource allocation and performance  and for which discrete financial information is available 
we manage our business based on the performance of four separate operating segments multifamily  office  retail and for sale residential 
investments in joint ventures to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related assets and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures  paragraph  we recognize gains on the contribution of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner s interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
we continually evaluate our investments in joint ventures for other than temporary declines in market value 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 
we have determined that these investments are not impaired as of december  and investment and development expenses investment and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to abandoned pursuits 
we incur costs prior to land acquisition including contract deposits  as well as legal  engineering and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of such developments 
if we determine that it is probable that we will not develop a particular project  any related pre development costs previously incurred are immediately expensed 
we recorded million  million and million in investment and development expenses in  and  respectively 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements  accordingly  the standard does not require any new fair value measurements of reported balances 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels and of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level of the hierarchy 
level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
as discussed above  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for our 
table of contents financial assets and liabilities on january  in february  the fasb reached a conclusion to defer the implementation of the sfas no 
provisions relating to non financial assets and liabilities until january  the fasb also reached a conclusion to amend sfas no 
to exclude sfas no 
accounting for leases and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value  but has resulted in certain additional disclosures see note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  for financial assets and financial liabilities and do not expect this adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we also adopted the deferral provisions of fasb staff position  or fsp  sfas no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of non financial assets and liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after november  we also adopted fsp sfas no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
this fsp  which provides guidance on measuring the fair value of a financial asset in an inactive market  had no impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the provisions of sfas no

did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
amends accounting research bulletin to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
sfas no 
also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of income  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after november   including interim periods beginning january  based on our evaluation of sfas no 
 we have concluded that it will continue to classify our noncontrolling interest as temporary equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of other provisions of sfas no 
on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which changes how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
certain provisions of this standard will  among other things  impact the determination of acquisition date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination including contingent consideration  exclude transaction costs from acquisition accounting  and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies  acquisition related restructuring costs  and tax benefits 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
is intended to help investors better understand how derivative instruments and hedging activities affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows through enhanced disclosure requirements 
the enhanced disclosures primarily surround disclosing the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments by their underlying risk as well as a tabular format of the fair values of the derivative instruments and their gains and losses 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we are currently evaluating how this standard will impact our disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities 

table of contents in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this fsp allows us to use our historical experience in renewing or extending the useful life of intangible assets 
this fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years and shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
we do not expect the application of this fsp to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an fsp  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf no 
 which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method as described in sfas no 
 earnings per share 
under the guidance in fsp eitf no 
 unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
the fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
all prior period earnings per share data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively 
early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact  if any  the adoption of fsp eitf no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the eitf issued eitf  equity method investment accounting considerations  which  among other items  clarifies that the initial carrying value of an equity method investment should be based on the cost accumulation model 
eitf is effective on a prospective basis in fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the application of eitf to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
inflation leases at the multifamily properties generally provide for an initial term of six months to one year and allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal 
leases at the office properties typically provide for rent adjustments and the pass through of certain operating expenses during the term of the lease 
substantially all of the leases at the retail properties provide for the pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
all of these provisions permit us to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and  therefore  serve to minimize our exposure to the adverse effects of inflation 
an increase in general price levels may immediately precede  or accompany  an increase in interest rates 
at december   our exposure to rising interest rates was mitigated by our high percentage of consolidated fixed rate debt 
as it relates to the short term  an increase in interest expense resulting from increasing inflation is anticipated to be less than future increases in income before interest 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  means income loss before minority interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciated property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
we believe that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and gains or losses from sales of properties all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
ffo is a widely recognized measure in the company s industry 
we believe that the line on our consolidated statement of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of 
table of contents reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
in addition to company management evaluating the operating performance of our reportable segments based on ffo results  management uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to key employees 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of financial performance  as cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or as a measure of liquidity nor is it indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs  including our ability to make distributions 
the following information is provided to reconcile net income available to common shareholders  the most comparable gaap financial measure  to ffo  and to show the items included in our ffo for the years ended december     and in thousands  except per share and unit data net income loss available to common shareholders adjustments consolidated minority interest in crlp minority interest in gain on sale of undepreciated property real estate depreciation real estate amortization consolidated gains from sales of property  net of income tax and minority interest gains from sales of undepreciated property  net of income tax and minority interest adjustments unconsolidated subsidiaries real estate depreciation real estate amortization gains from sales of property funds from operations funds from operations per share and unit basic funds from operations per share and unit diluted weighted average common shares outstanding basic weighted average partnership units outstanding basic weighted average shares and units outstanding basic effect of diluted securities weighted average shares and units outstanding diluted represents the weighted average of outstanding units of minority interest in crlp
