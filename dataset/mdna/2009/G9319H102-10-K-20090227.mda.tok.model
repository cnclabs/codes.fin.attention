table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe we are principally exposed to five types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk  liquidity risk  and effects of inflation 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company s fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio falls and the company has the risk that cash outflows will have to be funded by selling assets  which will be trading at depreciated values 
as interest rates decline  the market value of the company s fixed income portfolio increases and the company has reinvestment risk  as funds reinvested will earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of the insurance and reinsurance liabilities the company assumes 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity and short term investments from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of  or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity and short term investments from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of  or approximately million 
as at december   the impact on the company s fixed maturity portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of or approximately million 
as at december   the company held million  million  or  of the company s fixed maturity portfolio in asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of underlying loans increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
the adverse impact of prepayment is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
as a result  the company will be exposed to reinvestment risk  as cash flows received by the company will be accelerated and will be reinvested at the prevailing interest rates 
foreign currency risk certain of the company s reinsurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss 
foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that there is an increase in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which losses are ultimately owed 
therefore  we attempt to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total assets and million  or of our total liabilities were held in foreign currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total net liabilities held in foreign currencies was non monetary items which do not require revaluation at each reporting date 
as of december   million  or of our total assets and million  or of our total liabilities were held in foreign currencies 
as of december   million  or of our total net liabilities held in foreign currencies was non monetary items which do not require revaluation at each reporting date 
the company does not transact in foreign exchange markets to hedge its foreign currency exposure 
to the extent foreign currency exposure is not hedged  the company may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to us 
we attempt to limit our credit exposure by purchasing high quality fixed income investments to maintain an average portfolio credit quality of aa or higher with mortgage and commercial mortgage backed issues having an aggregate weighted average credit quality of aaa 
in addition  we have limited our exposure to any single issuer to or less of total investments  excluding treasury and agency securities 
the minimum credit rating of any security purchased is a a and where investments are downgraded  we permit a holding of up to in aggregate market value  or up to with written authorization of the company 
at december   of the portfolio was below a a and we did not have an aggregate exposure to any single issuer of more than of total investments  other than with respect to us government securities 
the amount of the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of the company s financial assets 
the company s primary credit risks reside in investment in us corporate bonds and recoverables from reinsurers at the talbot segment 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk arising from its exposure to individual reinsurers 
the reinsurance program is generally placed with reinsurers whose rating  at the time of placement  was a or better rated by s p or the equivalent with other rating agencies 
exposure to a single reinsurer is also controlled with restrictions dependent on rating 
of reinsurance recoverables which includes loss reserves recoverable and recoverables on paid losses at december  were from reinsurers rated a or better  december  rated a or better or from reinsurers posting full collateral 
validus re does not have any reinsurance recoverable balances that are not fully collateralized 
liquidity risk certain of the company s investments may become illiquid 
the current disruption in the credit markets may materially affect the liquidity of the company s investments  including residential mortgage backed securities which represent december  of total cash and investments 
if the company requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements which could include claims on a major catastrophic event in a period of market illiquidity  the investments may be difficult to sell in a timely manner and may have to be disposed of for less than what may otherwise have been possible under other conditions 
details of the company s debt and financing arrangements at december  are provided below maturity date dollars in thousands term outstanding junior subordinated deferrable debentures june   junior subordinated deferrable debentures june    unsecured letter of credit facility march   secured letter of credit facility march   talbot fal facility december   talbot third party fal facility december   total effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had or will have a material effect on our combined results of operations  except insofar as a inflation may affect interest rates  and b losses and loss expenses may be affected by inflation
