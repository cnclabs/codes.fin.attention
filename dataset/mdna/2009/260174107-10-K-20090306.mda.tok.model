item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion is based upon and should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
we classify our revenues as admissions  event related  broadcasting and other 
admissions includes ticket sales for all our events

 accounting for advertising barter transactions 
barter transactions accounted for   and  of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
expenses that are not directly related to a specific event are recorded as incurred 
expenses that specifically relate to an event are deferred until the event is held  at which time they are expensed 
our expenses include prize and point fund monies and sanction fees paid to various sanctioning bodies  including nascar  labor  advertising  cost of goods sold for merchandise and souvenirs  and other expenses associated with the promotion of our racing events 
results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in we promoted fifteen major events during and the majority of the  decrease resulted from lower admissions revenue at our june and september nascar event weekends at dover international speedway 
we believe the decrease in attendance was attributable in part to the general downturn in economic conditions  including higher gas prices since most of our customers are from out of state  and inclement weather for the june event weekend 
event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  increase was primarily due to higher sponsorship revenues at the majority of our major events we promoted during and higher concession sales at our june nascar sprint cup series event at dover international speedway 
broadcasting revenue was  in as compared to  in the  increase resulted primarily from higher broadcasting revenue for our nascar sanctioned events promoted during partially offsetting this increase was a  decrease in ancillary media rights fees in operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the  decrease primarily related to lower sanction fees  advertising and promotional expenses and hospitality expenses at the major events promoted at our mid west facilities 
these decreases were partially offset by higher operating and marketing expenses at our june and september nascar event weekends at dover international speedway 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment charges of  as a result of our review of the long lived assets of each of our midwest facilities for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded non cash impairment charges of   and  to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our memphis  nashville and gateway facilities  respectively  to fair value 

table of contents general and administrative expenses remained consistent between and at  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense was  in as compared to  in the increase was due primarily to assets placed in service during the second quarter of and related to our monster makeover project in dover  delaware 
net interest expense remained consistent between and at  and  respectively 
loss before income taxes was  in as compared to earnings of  in excluding the non cash impairment charges  our adjusted earnings before income tax expense were  in loss before income tax benefit non cash impairment charges adjusted earnings before income tax expense our adjusted earnings before income tax expense for were lower than our earnings before income tax expense in the prior year primarily as a result of the lower admissions and higher depreciation expense discussed above 
these reductions to earnings were partially offset by higher event related and broadcasting revenues and lower operating and marketing and interest expenses 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate from the prior year rate was primarily the result of recording a valuation allowance against the state tax benefits associated with the non cash impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of year ended december  vs 
year ended december  admissions revenue was  in as compared to  in we promoted fifteen major events during and the majority of the  decrease resulted from lower admissions revenue at most of the major events we promoted in as compared to the decrease in attendance was attributable in part to inclement weather 
event related revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease was primarily due to lower sponsorship revenues at our june nascar event weekend at dover international speedway and reduced revenues overall at the june event as a result of it being postponed one day due to rain 
additionally  event related revenues at our nashville and gateway facilities were lower in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase in event related revenue of  at our september nascar event weekend at the dover facility 
broadcasting revenue was  in as compared to  in the  decrease resulted primarily from lower television broadcasting rights related to our nascar sanctioned events promoted during effective for the race season  nascar entered into a new eight year agreement with its broadcast partners in which the annual average broadcast rights fees under that agreement will be approximately higher than the annual average of the prior six year agreement 
in the first year of the new contract  revenues were lower than the final year of the prior contract 
pursuant to the terms of our sanction agreements  nascar retains of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar sprint cup series or nascar nationwide series event as a component of its sanction fees and remits the remaining to us as the event promoter  which we record as revenue 
operating and marketing expenses were  in as compared to  in the  increase primarily related to higher operating and marketing expenses at our major motorsports events  most notably a  increase in advertising and promotions expenses and an increase in wages and benefits for grounds maintenance 

table of contents during the third quarter of  we recorded impairment charges of  principally as a result of our review of the long lived assets of each of our three midwest facilities for impairment 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded non cash impairment charges of   and  to write down the carrying value of long lived assets at our nashville  memphis and gateway facilities  respectively  to fair value 
based on the factors related to the long lived assets impairment  we completed an assessment of goodwill for potential impairment and determined that there was an impairment loss related to the goodwill balance of  that was associated with the midwest operations 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to write down to zero the carrying value of our goodwill 
additionally  in connection with the sale of our corporate aircraft  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  as of september   to write down the carrying amount of the aircraft to fair value 
general and administrative expenses remained consistent between and at  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense was  in as compared to  in the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in our depreciable asset base resulting from an impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of net interest expense was  in as compared to  in the increase resulted primarily from the recording of a  interest accrual for taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 partially offset by a decrease in our average outstanding borrowings 
earnings before income taxes were  in as compared to a loss of  in excluding the non cash impairment charges  our adjusted earnings before income tax expense were  in loss from continuing operations before income tax benefit non cash impairment charges adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income tax expense our earnings before income tax expense for were lower than our adjusted earnings before income tax expense from the same period in the prior year as a result of lower admissions  event related revenue and broadcasting revenues and higher operating expenses as discussed above 
these reductions to earnings were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization expenses 
our effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective income tax rate from the prior year rate was primarily the result of recording a valuation allowance against state tax benefits associated with non cash impairment charges recorded during liquidity and capital resources our operations are seasonal in nature with a majority of our motorsports events occurring during the second and third quarters 
however  our cash flows from operating activities are more evenly spread throughout the year  primarily due to the impact of advance ticket sales and other event related cash receipts  such as sponsorship and luxury suite rentals 
the non cash impairment charges we recorded in the fourth quarter of had no impact on our liquidity for the year ended december  as discussed in note impairment charges of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document  fair value of the assets for the nashville and gateway facilities was determined using a valuation methodology that consisted of the cost approach  which gave specific consideration to the value of the land plus contributory value to the improvements  and the comparable sales approach 
based upon the cost approach utilized for the valuations  there is an assumption that these two facilities will continue to operate as racetracks and it is our intention to continue operating them unless it is determined that future prospects no longer justify such action 
fair value of the assets for memphis was determined using a valuation methodology that considered the terms of the stock purchase agreement with gulf coast see note business operations of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document and the comparable sales approach 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was  in as compared to  in the decrease in was primarily due to the decrease in net earnings excluding non cash impairment charges 
net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations was  in as compared to  in capital expenditures were  in  down from  in the additions related primarily to the monster makeover project  including the construction of a new entranceway  fan zone and medical center placed in service in the second quarter of  and the renovation and construction of other fan amenities at our dover facility

the dividend is payable on march  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  at december   dover motorsports  inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries  as co borrowers  were parties to a  unsecured revolving credit agreement with a bank group

in addition  the credit agreement includes a material adverse change clause 
the credit facility also provides that if we default under any other loan agreement  that would be a default under this credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the terms of the credit facility including all covenants 
material adverse changes in our results of operations could impact our ability to maintain financial ratios necessary to satisfy these requirements 
there was  outstanding under the credit facility at december   at a weighted average interest rate of 
after consideration of stand by letters of credit outstanding  borrowings of  were available pursuant to the credit facility at december  based on projected future results  we expect to be in compliance with all of the covenants for all measurement periods during the next twelve months 
effective october   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted  of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate basis  thereby hedging against the impact of potential interest rate changes

in march  we received a  non refundable deposit towards the purchase price 
we promoted nascar nationwide series event  nascar camping world truck series event and nhra event in at our memphis location 
although we will no longer own this facility after the close of the sale  we expect to enter into an agreement with gulf coast to provide management services for the memphis facility 
cash provided by operating activities is expected to substantially fund our capital expenditures and maintenance of a dividend in based on current business conditions  we expect to spend approximately  on capital expenditures during these expenditures primarily relate to our monster makeover project 
on may   we announced plans for a five year capital improvement project  referred to as the monster makeover  that will provide new offerings and upgraded amenities for fans  competitors and the media 
the project is expected to take up to five years to complete at an estimated total cost of approximately  to  of which approximately  was spent as of december  we continue to review the amount and timing of capital expenditures in light of our current earnings level 
additionally  we expect to contribute between  and  to our pension plans in in order to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements 
we expect continued cash flows from operating activities and funds available from our credit agreement to provide for our working capital needs and capital spending requirements at least through the next twelve months  as well as any cash dividends our board of directors may declare  and also provide for our long term liquidity 
contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations and other commercial commitments payments due by period total thereafter revolving line of credit swida bonds b total debt estimated interest payments on revolving line of credit a interest payments on swida bonds b operating leases pension contributions c total contractual cash obligations a the future interest payments on our revolving credit agreement were estimated using the current outstanding principal as of december  and related interest rates 
b in  midwest racing entered into an agreement with swida to receive the proceeds from the taxable sports facility revenue bonds  series gateway international motorsports corporation project  a municipal bond offering  in the aggregate principal amount of  of which  was outstanding at december  swida loaned all of the proceeds from the municipal bond offering to midwest racing for the purpose of the redevelopment  construction and expansion of gateway 
the proceeds of the swida bonds were irrevocably committed to complete construction of gateway  to fund interest  to create a debt service reserve fund and to pay for the cost of issuance of the bonds 
the repayment terms and debt service reserve requirements of the bonds issued in the municipal bond offering correspond to the terms of the swida bonds 
the bonds are being amortized through february 
table of contents we have established certain restricted cash funds to meet debt service as required by the swida bonds  which are held by the trustee bny trust company of missouri 
at december    of cash and cash equivalents were restricted by the swida bonds and are appropriately classified as a non current asset in our consolidated balance sheet 
the swida bonds are secured by a first mortgage lien on all the real property owned and a security interest in all property leased by gateway 
also  the swida bonds are unconditionally guaranteed by midwest racing 
the swida bonds bear interest at a rate of 
interest expense related to the swida bonds was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have a stand by letter of credit for  which is secured by a trust deed on our facilities in memphis  tennessee  available to satisfy debt service reserve fund obligations 
in addition  a portion of the property taxes to be paid by gateway if any to the city of madison tax incremental fund have been pledged to the annual retirement of debt and payment of interest 
c we expect to contribute between  and  to our pension plans for in order to satisfy minimum statutory funding requirements 
for years subsequent to  we are unable to estimate what our pension contributions will be 
in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  series  to acquire  construct and develop certain public infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding at december  annual principal payments range from  in september to  in and are payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  we would become responsible for the difference 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in us being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
in the event we were unable to make the payments  they would be made pursuant to a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by our bank group 
we believe that the sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility will continue to satisfy the necessary debt service requirements of the bonds through the maturity date in as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during  we paid  into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
if the debt service is not satisfied from the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility  a portion of the bonds would become our liability 
if we fail to maintain the letter of credit that secures the bonds or we allow an uncured event of default to exist under our reimbursement agreement relative to the letter of credit  the bonds would be immediately redeemable 
we have not included our non current income taxes payable of  which is classified in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
in the contractual obligations disclosure since we cannot reasonably estimate the period of potential cash settlement for unrecognized tax benefits 
related party transactions see note related party transactions of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those we consider critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   our valuation allowance net of federal income taxes was  which increased by  in  on deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carry forwards 
we have considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
we perform reviews for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
generally  fair value is determined using valuation techniques such as the comparable sales approach and for facilities the cost approach  which gives specific consideration to the value of the land plus contributory value to the improvements 
see note impairment charges of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for further discussion 
accrued pension cost the benefits provided by our defined benefit pension plans are based on years of service and employee s remuneration over their employment with us 
accrued pension costs are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider a number of factors  including estimates for the discount rate  assumed rate of compensation increase  and expected long term rate of return on assets 
changes in these estimates would impact the amounts that we record in our consolidated financial statements

documents incorporated by reference into this annual report may also contain forward looking statements 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
to comply 
table of contents with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
when words and expressions such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans  intends  objectives  goals  aims  projects  forecasts  possible  seeks  may  could  should  might  likely  enable or similar words or expressions are used in this document  as well as statements containing phrases such as in our view  there can be no assurance  although no assurance can be given or there is no way to anticipate with certainty  forward looking statements are being made 
various risks and uncertainties may affect the operation  performance  development and results of our business and could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in our forward looking statements  including the following factors stability and viability of sanctioning bodies  success of or changes in our growth strategies  development and potential acquisition of new facilities  trends and uncertainties in the motorsports industry  patron demographics  obtaining favorable contracts relative to sponsorships  event sanctions and broadcast rights  relationships with sanctioning bodies  sponsors  broadcast media  drivers and teams  general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending sentiment  ability to finance future business requirements  ability to maintain compliance with debt covenants  the effect of changing interest rates  the availability of adequate levels of insurance  ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses  management retention and development  changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  the effect of weather conditions on outdoor event attendance  military or other government actions  availability of air travel  and national or local catastrophic events 
the above risks and uncertainties and the cautionary statements below should be considered in connection with any future forward looking statements we make 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of future developments  events or conditions 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ 
table of contents significantly from those forecast in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward looking statements as an indication of our actual future results 
our relationships with and the success of various sanctioning bodies is vital to our success in motorsports our continued success in motorsports is dependent upon the success of various governing bodies of motorsports that sanction national racing events and our ability to secure favorable contracts with and maintain a good working relationship with these sanctioning bodies  particularly nascar 
sanctioning bodies regularly issue and award sanctioned events and their issuance depends  in large part  on maintaining good working relationships with the sanctioning bodies 
many events are sanctioned on an annual basis with no contractual obligation to renew  including our agreements with nascar 
by awarding a sanctioned event or a series of sanctioned events  the sanctioning bodies do not warrant  nor are they responsible for  the financial success of any sanctioned event 
our success is directly tied to our ability to negotiate favorable terms to our sanction agreements  including the amount of the sanction fee and purse  and our ability to continue to derive economic benefits from such agreements  such as our share of live broadcast revenues 
our ability to obtain additional sanctioned events in the future and to negotiate favorable terms to our sanction agreements and the success of a particular sanctioning body in attracting drivers and teams  signing series sponsors and negotiating favorable television and or radio broadcast rights is dependent on many factors which are largely outside of our control 
as our success depends on the terms of our sanction agreements and the success of each event or series that we are promoting  a material change in the terms of a sanction agreement or a material adverse effect on a sanctioning body  such as the loss or defection of top drivers  the loss of significant series sponsors  or the failure to obtain favorable broadcast coverage or to properly advertise the event or series could result in a reduction in our revenues from live broadcast coverage  admissions  luxury suite rentals  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenues we receive a portion of our annual revenues from sponsorship agreements  including the sponsorship of our various events and our permanent venues  such as title  official product and promotional partner sponsorships  billboards  signage and skyboxes 
loss of our existing title sponsors or other major sponsorship agreements or failure to secure such sponsorship agreements in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are in negotiations with various potential sponsors for our events  including title sponsors for our two nascar sprint cup series events and one of our nascar nationwide series events at dover international speedway  one of our nascar nationwide series events at nashville superspeedway  and our nascar nationwide series and nascar camping world truck series events at memphis motorsports park 
our motorsports events face intense competition for attendance  television viewership and sponsorship we compete with other auto speedways for the patronage of motor racing spectators as well as for sponsorships 
moreover  racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks 
the quality of the competition  type of racing event  caliber of the event  sight lines  ticket pricing  location and customer conveniences  among other things  distinguish the motorsports facilities 
in addition  all of our events compete with other sports and recreational events scheduled on the same dates 
as a result  our revenues and operations are affected not only by our ability to compete in the motorsports promotion market  but also by the availability of alternative spectator sports events  forms of entertainment and changing consumer preferences 

table of contents general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending  could negatively affect our financial results our financial results depend significantly upon a number of factors relating to discretionary consumer and corporate spending  including economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income and corporate budgets such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation rates 
these factors can impact both attendance at our events and advertising and marketing dollars available from the motorsports industry s principal sponsors and potential sponsors 
economic and other lifestyle conditions such as illiquid consumer and business credit markets adversely affect consumer and corporate spending thereby impacting our growth  revenue and profitability 
unavailability of credit on favorable terms can adversely impact our operations  growth  development and capital spending plans 
general economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks and the war in iraq and could be similarly affected by any future attacks  by a terrorist attack at any mass gathering or fear of such attacks  or by other acts or prospects of war 
any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance  security or other related matters 
a weakened economic and business climate  as well as consumer uncertainty and the loss of consumer confidence created by such a climate  could adversely affect our financial results 
the sales tax and property tax revenues to service the revenue bonds for infrastructure improvements at nashville may be inadequate in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in revenue bonds to build local infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding on december  debt service on the bonds is payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
as of december  and   and  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during  we paid  into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the event the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  we would become responsible for the difference 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in us being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
in the event we were unable to make the payments  they would be made under a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by our bank group 
we would be responsible to reimburse the banks for any drawings made under the letter of credit 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and compliance with debt covenants 
the seasonality of our motorsports events increases the variability of quarterly earnings our business has been  and is expected to remain  seasonal given that it depends on our outdoor events for a substantial portion of revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our motorsports revenues from admissions  event related and broadcasting revenue attributable to six nascar sanctioned events at dover  delaware which are currently held in may and september 
total revenues from these events were approximately of total revenues for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this has been offset to some degree by our other motorsports events  but quarterly earnings will vary 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover catastrophic incidents we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in the opinion of management  to protect us from material financial loss incurred in the ordinary course of business 
we also purchase special event insurance for motorsports events to protect against race related liability 
however  there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
if we are held liable for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage  including punitive damages  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents bad weather can have an adverse financial impact on our motorsports events we sponsor and promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things at these events 
although we sell many tickets well in advance of the outdoor events and these tickets are issued on a non refundable basis  poor weather conditions may adversely affect additional ticket sales and concessions and souvenir sales  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain weather related insurance for major events 
due to the importance of clear visibility and safe driving conditions to motorsports racing events  outdoor racing events may be significantly affected by weather patterns and seasonal weather changes 
any unanticipated weather changes could impact our ability to stage events 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us if one of our events is postponed because of weather or other reasons such as  for example  the general postponement of all major sporting events in this country following the september  terrorism attacks  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased revenues from tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we could incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as lose the revenues  including live broadcast revenues associated with the event 
if a cancelled event is part of the nascar sprint cup series or nascar nationwide series  we could experience a reduction in the amount of money received from television revenues for all of our nascar sanctioned events in the series that experienced the cancellation 
this would occur if  as a result of the cancellation  and without regard to whether the cancelled event was scheduled for one of our facilities  nascar experienced a reduction in broadcast revenues greater than the amount scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the cancelled event 
due to our concentrated stock ownership  stockholders may have no effective voice in our management we have elected to be treated as a controlled corporation as defined by new york stock exchange rule a 
we are a controlled corporation because a single person  henry b 
tippie  the chairman of our board of directors  controls in excess of fifty percent of our voting power 
this means that he has the ability to determine the outcome of the election of directors at our annual meetings and to determine the outcome of many significant corporate transactions  many of which only require the approval of a majority of our voting power 
such a concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us at a premium 
in addition  as a controlled corporation  we are not required to comply with certain new york stock exchange rules 
we may not be able to maintain our listing with the new york stock exchange our common stock is traded on the nyse 
we are required to maintain market capitalization of more than  measured over a day trading period or stockholders equity of more than  in order to remain in compliance with nyse continued listing standards 
nyse notified us on february  that we are below compliance because as of february  our trading day average market capitalization was million and our stockholder s equity as of december  was  we have days from receipt of the notice from the nyse to submit a plan to them and demonstrate our ability to achieve compliance with continued listing standards within months 
we intend to submit such a plan 
during this time our common stock will continue to be listed on the nyse  subject to our compliance with other nyse continued listing requirements 
if we are not able to regain compliance with nyse listing standards  our stock will be delisted from trading on the nyse 
this would result in the need to find another market on which our stock can be listed or cause our stock to cease trading on an active market  which could result in a reduction in the liquidity for our stock and a reduction in demand for our stock 

table of contents it is our expectation that stock market conditions will improve and that we will either be able to achieve compliance with nyse continued listing standards or take the steps necessary to list our stock on another national securities exchange  such as nasdaq or nyse alternext 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so and our stock may ultimately trade on an over the counter market 
non compliance with nyse continued listing standards or delisting from the nyse could negatively impact us  including  without limitation  our relationships with stockholders  businesses and lenders  our access to debt and equity financing  and our ability to attract and retain personnel by means of equity compensation 
this  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
securities traded in the over the counter market generally have significantly less liquidity than securities traded on a national securities exchange  through factors such as a reduction in the number of investors that will consider investing in the securities  the number of market makers in the securities  reduction in securities analyst and news media coverage and lower market prices than might otherwise be obtained 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we have marketable securities of  these securities  which consist of mutual funds  are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 
fair value is determined based on the current market values 
at december   there was  outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
the credit agreement bears interest at our option  upon libor plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio or the base rate the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
historically  we managed our mix of fixed and variable rate debt by structuring the terms of our debt agreements 
effective october   we entered into a  interest rate swap agreement that effectively converted this portion of the outstanding variable rate borrowings under the revolving credit agreement to fixed rate securities  thereby hedging against the impact of potential interest rate changes 
under this agreement  we pay a fixed interest rate of 
in return  the issuing lender refunds to us the variable rate interest paid to the bank group under our revolving credit agreement on the same notional principal amount  excluding the margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio 
the notional amount of the swap agreement decreased to  on november   to  on november   and to  on november  the agreement terminates on november  as of december   the interest rate swap had a negative fair value of  an increase in interest rates of one percent would result in the interest rate swap having a negative fair value of approximately  at december  a decrease in interest rates of one percent would result in the interest rate swap having a negative fair value of approximately  at december  a change in interest rates will have no impact on the interest expense associated with the  of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement that are subject to the interest rate swap agreement 
a change in interest rates of one percent on the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at december  not subject to the interest rate swap would cause a change in total annual interest costs of  the borrowings under our revolving credit agreement bear interest at the variable rate described above and therefore approximate fair value at december  at december   our outstanding balance of the swida bonds had a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  the fair value was determined through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology applying interest rates which we believe would be available to us for issues with similar terms at december  in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  of which  was outstanding at december  these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  however  we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant increase in interest rates could result in our being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility
