item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in part i item a above under the caption risk factors 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
ongoing business activities we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel  proprietary antibodies for the treatment of cancer  inflammation and autoimmune diseases 
our product development pipeline includes novel antibodies generated with our proprietary bite antibody platform  as well as conventional monoclonal antibodies 
bite antibodies represent a new class of antibodies that activate the t cells of a patient s immune system to eliminate cancer cells 
t cells are considered the most powerful killer cells of the human immune system 
four of our antibodies are currently in clinical trials  while the remainder of our product pipeline is in preclinical development 
our bite antibody blinatumomab  also known as mt  is being evaluated in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with all and in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with nhl 
we were previously developing blinatumomab in collaboration with medimmune llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of astrazeneca plc 
as described in further detail under research and development below  in march  medimmune elected to commence the development of a new bite antibody for the treatment of hematological cancers as a substitute for blinatumomab 
we will continue the development of 
table of contents blinatumomab in europe as planned  and are evaluating our strategy for the development of blinatumomab in the united states 
a second bite antibody  mt  is being tested in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with solid tumors 
mt binds to epcam  which is overexpressed in many solid tumors 
our human monoclonal antibody adecatumumab  also known as mt  also binds to epcam and is being developed under a collaboration with merck serono 
current clinical development of this antibody includes an ongoing phase b clinical trial evaluating adecatumumab in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer 
in the first half of  we expect to initiate a multi center  randomized  controlled phase trial with adecatumumab in crc patients after complete resection of liver metastases 
our monoclonal antibody mt  also known as trc  is licensed to tracon pharmaceuticals  inc and is being developed in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with cancer 
in addition to the four antibodies described above  we have established a collaboration with nycomed for the development and commercialization of mt  our human antibody neutralizing the activity of gm csf  which has potential applications in the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis  psoriasis  or multiple sclerosis 
we expect our partner nycomed to commence a phase clinical trial of mt in we also expect our licensee morphotek  a wholly owned subsidiary of eisai  to initiate a first phase clinical trial in with mt  a glycolipid binding human antibody developed under a license from us  for the treatment of melanoma 
in january  we entered into an agreement with bayer schering pharma ag under which we have granted bayer schering pharma an exclusive option to license a specified bite antibody against an undisclosed solid tumor target 
in addition  we have generated and will continue to generate novel bite antibodies with our bite antibody platform technology 
bite antibodies targeting cea  mscp  cd  her  egfr and other target antigens are in various stages of early development 
to date  we have incurred significant research and development expenses and have not achieved any revenues from sales of our product candidates 
each of our programs will require many years and significant costs to advance through development 
typically  it takes many years from the initial identification of a lead compound to the completion of preclinical and clinical trials  before applying for marketing approval from the fda or emea  or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries and regions 
the risk that a program has to be terminated  in part or in full  for safety reasons or lack of adequate efficacy is very high 
in particular  we cannot predict which  if any  product candidates can be successfully developed and for which marketing approval may be obtained  or the time and cost to complete development 
as we obtain results from preclinical studies or clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue the development of one or more product candidates for safety  efficacy or commercial reasons 
we may also elect to discontinue development of one or more product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
depending on the structure of such collaborative agreements  a third party may be granted control over the clinical trial process for one of our product candidates 
in such a situation  the third party  rather than us  may in fact control development and commercialization decisions for the respective product candidate 
consistent with our business model  we may enter into additional collaboration agreements in the future 
we cannot predict the terms of such agreements or their potential impact on our capital requirements 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner  or our failure to enter into new collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and affect our liquidity 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through private placements of preferred stock  government grants for research  research contribution revenues from our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  debt financing  licensing revenues and milestone achievements and  more recently  private placements of common stock and associated warrants 
we intend to continue to seek funding through public or private financings in the future 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience substantial dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to existing stockholders 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through debt financings  these financings may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all 

table of contents research and development through december   our research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with the clinical development of adecatumumab and blinatumomab  as well as development costs incurred for mt and mt  research activities under our collaborations with medimmune and nycomed  and research conducted with respect to the bite antibody platform 
the costs incurred include costs associated with clinical trials and manufacturing processes  quality systems and analytical development  including compensation and other personnel expenses  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  facility costs  license fees and depreciation 
except for payments made for services rendered  we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses that may increase from historical levels as we further develop our compounds into more advanced stages of clinical development and increase our preclinical efforts for our human antibodies and bite antibodies in cancer  anti inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
our strategic collaborations and license agreements generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be partly or wholly funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified development or commercialization milestones are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon our collaborations 
under our collaboration agreement with merck serono  we have received million in up front and milestone payments from merck serono to date  not including reimbursements for costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development of adecatumumab 
the agreement provides for potential future clinical development milestone payments of up to an additional million 
in a november amendment to the original agreement  we and merck serono agreed that micromet would continue to conduct an ongoing phase clinical trial testing the safety of adecatumumab in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
in october  we and merck serono further amended the agreement and reallocated certain of our respective development responsibilities with respect to adecatumumab 
as part of the revised responsibilities  micromet now has all decisionmaking authority and operational responsibility for the ongoing phase clinical trial  as well as an additional phase clinical trial to be conducted by us and which we expect to commence in merck serono will continue to bear the development expenses associated with the collaboration in accordance with the agreed upon budget 
during and  we developed blinatumomab under a collaboration and license agreement entered into with medimmune in under this agreement  medimmune reimbursed a portion of the clinical development costs incurred by us in our clinical trials in europe 
under the terms of the agreement  medimmune had the rights and the obligation to develop and commercialize blinatumomab in north america  while we retained all rights to blinatumomab outside of north america 
medimmune was also granted the right to develop other bite antibodies binding to specific antigens relevant for hematological cancers in addition to or instead of blinatumomab 
in march  medimmune elected to commence the development of a new bite antibody for the treatment of hematological cancers as a substitute for blinatumomab 
under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  we will be responsible for generating the new bite antibody and for certain early preclinical development activities pursuant to a research plan to be agreed upon by the parties 
medimmune will bear all of the costs incurred by us in conducting the research plan for this bite antibody  and will be responsible for all of the development costs of this bite antibody in north america 
in addition  medimmune will be required to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain development milestone events related to the new antibody  and  if it receives marketing approval  to pay a royalty on net sales of this bite antibody in north america 
we have retained all rights to this new bite antibody outside of north america  and have the right  at no cost to us  to use the data generated by medimmune in the course of the development in north america for obtaining marketing approvals outside of north america 
medimmune will be developing the new bite antibody in north america and we will be assuming responsibility for the worldwide development and commercialization of blinatumomab 
however  under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  medimmune will remain obligated to develop the 
table of contents commercial scale manufacturing process for blinatumomab at its cost 
also  medimmune will remain obligated to supply our requirements of blinatumomab for the clinical trials inside and outside of north america 
further  upon the first marketing approval of blinatumomab in the united states  medimmune will have a one time option to reacquire the commercialization rights to blinatumomab in north america 
if medimmune were to exercise this option  it would be required to pay us all of the milestone payments that would have become due if medimmune had developed blinatumomab in the united states  the global development costs incurred by us after the return of the rights to blinatumomab to us  and an additional payment calculated as a percentage of these development costs 
in addition  medimmune would then pay a royalty on net sales of blinatumomab in north america 
a second agreement with medimmune under which medimmune is developing mt provides for potential future milestone payments and royalty payments based on future sales of mt the potential milestone payments are subject to the successful completion of development and obtaining marketing approval in one or more national markets 
we intend to pursue additional collaborations to provide resources for further development of our product candidates and expect to continue to grant technology access licenses 
however  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether we will be able to enter into collaborative agreements  and if we do  on what terms we might do so 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates 
however  we expect our research and development costs associated with these product candidates to increase as we continue to develop new indications and advance these product candidates through preclinical and clinical trials 
clinical development timelines  the likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate as well as relevant commercial factors 
the costs and timing for developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the expenditure of substantial resources will be required for the lengthy process of clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals as well as to comply with applicable regulations 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition our revenues generally consist of licensing fees  milestone payments  royalties and fees for research services earned from license agreements or from research and development collaboration agreements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  upon the satisfaction of the following four criteria persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on up front payments over the expected life of the development period and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 
milestone payments are derived from the achievement of predetermined goals under the collaboration agreements 
for milestones that are subject to contingencies  the related contingent revenue is not recognized until the milestone has been reached and customer acceptance has 
table of contents been obtained as necessary 
fees for research and development services performed under the agreements are generally stated at a yearly fixed fee per research scientist 
we recognize revenue as the services are performed 
amounts received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
we have received initial license fees and annual renewal fees upfront each year under license agreements 
revenue is recognized when the above noted criteria are satisfied unless we have further obligations associated with the license granted 
we are entitled to receive royalty payments on the sale of products under license and collaboration agreements 
royalties are based upon the volume of products sold and are recognized as revenue upon notification of sales from the customer 
through december   we have not received or recognized any royalty payments 
for arrangements that include multiple deliverables  we identify separate units of accounting based on the consensus reached on emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement is allocated to the separated units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each unit of accounting 
we recognize revenue on development and collaboration agreements  including upfront payments  where they are considered combined units of accounting  over the expected life of the development period and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
a reporting unit is an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit  the development of biopharmaceutical products 
conditions that would necessitate a goodwill impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash inflows from product sales and other sources  and developing appropriate discount rates and success probability rates by project 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to measure the impairment loss 
as a result of the merger between micromet ag and cancervax in  we recorded million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that the carrying amount of this goodwill was recoverable 
we cannot assure you that our future reviews of goodwill impairment will not result in a material charge 
impairment of long lived and identifiable intangible assets the evaluation for impairment of long lived and intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgment by management 
subsequent to the initial recording of long lived and intangible assets  we must test such assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
when we conduct our impairment tests  factors that are important in determining whether impairment might exist include assumptions regarding our underlying business and product candidates and other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external factors  could result in impairment 
such impairment charge  if any  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based compensation awards on the grant date in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the black scholes option pricing model 
we apply the provisions of sab nos 
and in developing our methodologies to estimate our black scholes model inputs 
option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free rate of interest is based on the us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividend yield is projected at  as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on our historical volatility and the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies 
the expected term of at the money options granted is derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term  as described in sab nos 
and sfas no 
r also requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate for the year ended december  was based on historical forfeiture experience for similar levels of employees to whom the options were granted 
common stock warrants liability in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  we classify warrants as liabilities when the potential for a net cash settlement to the holders of the warrants exists  even if remote 
eitf also requires that the warrants be revalued at the end of each reporting period until the warrants are exercised or expire 
we adjust the instruments to their current fair value using the black scholes option pricing model formula at each reporting period end  with any resulting change in value recorded in the statement of operations 
recent accounting standards and pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
eitf supersedes eitf issue no 
 the meaning of indexed to a company s own stock  and provides guidance in evaluating whether certain financial instruments or embedded features can be excluded from the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
eitf sets forth a two step approach that evaluates an instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions for the purpose of determining whether such instruments are indexed to an issuer s own stock  which is a requirement necessary to comply with the scope exception under sfas no 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact related to the adoption of eitf on our financial instruments 
in december  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements 
the eitf concluded on the definition of a collaborative arrangement and that revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in eitf issue no 
and other accounting literature 
based on the nature of the arrangement  payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and the terms  the nature of the entity s business  and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature would be presented 
companies are also required to disclose the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however  required disclosure under eitf applies to the entire collaborative agreement 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of eitf  however  we do not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  and requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquired company at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as the non controlling interest in the acquired company  at the full amounts of their fair values 
sfas no 
r makes various other amendments to authoritative literature intended to provide additional guidance or conform the guidance in that literature to that provided in sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
the potential impact of adopting sfas no 
r on our future consolidated financial statements will depend on the magnitude and frequency of our future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to improve the relevance  comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries not held by the parent to be clearly identified  labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
sfas no 
also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of operations 
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest must be accounted for consistently  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained non controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value 
the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any non controlling equity investment 
sfas no 
also requires entities to provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
sfas no 
applies prospectively to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements and applies prospectively for all fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the retrospective presentation and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
will be applied to any prior periods presented in financial statements for the fiscal year ending december  and later periods during which we have a consolidated subsidiary with a noncontrolling interest 
as of december   we do not have any consolidated subsidiaries in which there is a noncontrolling interest 
we do not believe that its adoption will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

year ended december  collaborative r d revenue nycomed medimmune merck serono tracon other total collaborative r d revenue license and other revenue total revenues collaborative r d revenue 
collaborative r d revenue consists of reimbursements for full time equivalents and pass through expenses we incur under each collaborative agreement 

table of contents nycomed 
collaborative research and development revenues from nycomed reflect nycomed s full cost responsibility for the mt program 
the nycomed revenue represents the reimbursement of our preclinical development activities  including reimbursement for full time equivalents as well as the portion of the up front payment from nycomed that is being recognized over a year period 
the nycomed collaboration commenced during the middle of  and full clinical activities did not commence until the fourth quarter of  which accounts for the increase in over as this program progresses from the pre clinical stage to clinical trials  the responsibility for the development work will shift to nycomed 
therefore we expect revenues and costs under this collaboration to be significantly lower than in medimmune 
collaborative research and development revenues from medimmune represent medimmune s share of the costs of clinical development of blinatumomab and its full cost responsibility for the development of mt the increase in medimmune revenue was due to increases in the work performed under our blinatumomab program in of million  while revenues under the mt program of million in were consistent with those of the prior year 
as described elsewhere in this report  in march  medimmune elected to commence the development of a new bite antibody for the treatment of hematological cancers as a substitute for blinatumomab 
under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement with medimmune  we will be responsible for generating the new bite antibody and for certain early preclinical development activities pursuant to a research plan to be agreed upon by the parties 
medimmune will reimburse us for all of the costs incurred by us in conducting the research plan for the new bite antibody 
we expect a decrease in revenue from medimmune as the activities expected to be conducted in and with respect to the new bite antibody will be less costly in the initial stages than the clinical development of blinatumomab 
merck serono 
collaborative research and development revenues from merck serono reflect merck serono s full cost responsibility for the adecatumumab program 
the decrease in revenue for results from amendments to our collaboration agreement with merck serono that had the effect of lengthening the time over which revenue is recognized for the phase study of mt in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer 
the period was extended from june to june we expect revenues to be consistent with those of tracon 
collaborative research and development revenues from tracon reflect tracon s full cost responsibility for the mt program 
the tracon revenue during represents the sale of clinical material  cell banks  and toxicology materials transferred under the terms of our agreement with tracon  miscellaneous pass through expenses and the portion of the up front payment received from tracon that is being recognized over a year period 
we expect revenues to be consistent with those of license and other revenue 
license and other revenue consists primarily of revenues under licenses of patents relating to single chain antibody technology  for which we serve as the exclusive marketing partner under a marketing agreement with enzon pharmaceuticals  inc we recognized million and million in revenues related to these license agreements for the years ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover and develop product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  outside service costs including production of clinical material  fees for services in the context of clinical trials  medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
process development expenses were mainly incurred for production of gmp grade clinical trial material  as well as fermentation  purification and formulation development 
preclinical development expenses cover pharmacological in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as development of analytical testing procedures 
except for payments made in advance of services rendered  we expense research and development costs as incurred 
payments made in advance of services are recognized as research and development expense as the related services are incurred 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases in manufacturing expenses of million and preclinical services of million primarily related to our mt program  while increases in clinical expenses of million for our blinatumomab program and million for our mt program and an overall increase in personnel expenses of million  primarily due to headcount  account for the remainder of the increase

major program blinatumomab   mt   adecatumumab   mt   total   general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal and audit services 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
facility charges decreased by million primarily due to an adjustment to our lease exit liability recorded in related to our former corporate headquarters 
this decrease was offset by an increase of million in audit and tax services and an increase of million in depreciation charges related to leasehold improvements made for the roche sublease of our munich facility 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was due to our repayment of our silent partnership debt in july change in fair value of common stock warrants liability 
under the terms of the warrants issued in connection with a private placement that closed in june  if  at any time while any of the warrants is outstanding  we are merged or consolidated with or into another company  we sell all or substantially all of our assets in one or a series of related transactions  any tender offer or exchange offer is completed pursuant to which holders of our common stock are permitted to tender or exchange their shares for other securities  cash or property  or we effect any reclassification of our common stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the common stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities  cash or property  then we or any successor entity are obligated to purchase any unexercised warrants from the holder for cash in an amount equal to its value computed using the black scholes option pricing model with prescribed guidelines 
as a consequence of these provisions  the warrants are classified as a liability on our balance sheet  and changes in our stock price cause the fair value of the warrants to change each reporting period  with these changes being reflected in the statement of operations 
increases in our stock price cause the warrant liability to increase  and this increase is recorded as a component of other expense  while decreases in our stock price cause the liability to decrease  which is recorded as a component of other income 
the expense of million recorded during represents an increase in the fair value of the warrants as of december  as compared to their value on december  the income of million recorded during represents a decrease in the fair value of the warrants as of december  as compared to their value on june   the date of issuance 
other income expense 
other income expense includes foreign currency transaction gains losses and miscellaneous other items 
other income expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease results from two items recorded during a release of million of recorded obligations to an unrelated party in exchange for the return of ex us rights to technology which we no longer intended to pursue  and a refund of withholding taxes of million that we received from the german tax authorities 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in is primarily due to a private placement financing that we closed in october  which yielded net proceeds to us of million 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used in operating activities for the year ended december  the majority of the cash used was to fund our ongoing research and development efforts that resulted in a net loss of million 
net cash flow from operations was adjusted by million for non cash expenses  including million related to the change in the fair value of warrants  million for stock based compensation and million for depreciation and amortization 
for  the non cash items included a gain related to the change in the fair value of warrants of million  million for stock based compensation expenses and million for depreciation and amortization 
changes in working capital during included net collections on accounts receivable of million 
for  significant working capital changes included up front payments from collaborators of million from nycomed and million from tracon  less decreases in accounts payable of million and increases in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used in investing activities for the year ended december  the decrease is due to lower investment in property and equipment during as compared to most of these expenditures during related to leasehold improvements in conjunction with the roche sublease of our munich facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided by financing activities for the year ended december  our october private placement of common stock and warrants resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  while a june private placement resulted in net proceeds of million 
in addition  we received million during from stock option and warrant exercises 
we also repaid million in silent partnership debt during as compared to repayments of million during to date  we have funded our operations through proceeds from private placements of preferred stock  government grants for research  research contribution revenues from our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  licensing and milestone payments related to our product candidate partnering activities  debt financing and  most recently  through private placements of common stock and associated warrants 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will continue for at least the next several years and we will need to raise additional funds to meet future working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we may wish to raise substantial funds through the sale of our common stock or raise additional funds through debt financing or through additional strategic collaboration agreements 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or whether it will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
based on our capital resources as of the date of this report  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations into the second half of  without considering any potential future milestone payments that we may receive under any new collaborations we may enter into in the future  any future capital raising transactions or any drawdowns from our ceff with kingsbridge capital limited 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock  substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result 
if we were to raise additional funds through additional debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
if we raise funds through corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
failure to obtain adequate financing may adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate as a going concern 

table of contents our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors and involves risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors in this report 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any corporate collaborations that we may establish  and the success of these collaborations  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost and timing of establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales  and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and us and foreign government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because of the relatively short maturities of our investments  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial instruments 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
exchange rates a significant majority of our cash and cash equivalents are currently denominated in us dollars  as are a significant amount of the potential milestone payments and royalty payments under our collaboration agreements 
however  a significant portion of our operating expenses  including our research and development expenses  are incurred in europe pursuant to arrangements that are generally denominated in euros 

table of contents as a result  our financial results and capital resources may be affected by changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
as of december   we had us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents of million and euro denominated liabilities of approximately million 
the euro amount as of december  is equivalent to approximately million  using the exchange rate as of that date 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in an increase in our reported operating expenses due to the translation of the euro denominated expenses into us dollars  and such changes would negatively impact the length of time that our existing capital resources would be sufficient to finance our operations 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions to manage this exchange rate exposure 
the following table shows the hypothetical impact of a change to the euro us dollar exchange rate
