our opportunities for long term growth are accompanied by challenges and risks  particularly in the current steep recessionary environment 
our results are dependent on consumer demand for our products and factors such as general economic and business conditions  interest rate fluctuations  consumer credit availability  energy costs  geo political stability  customer traffic  tax law  stock market activity and other consumer impacting conditions 
the recent unprecedented volatility that has disrupted capital and consumer markets has also reduced incomes and employment and reduced consumer confidence to levels that have not been seen in decades 
since fashion and fashion related products are viewed as discretionary spending  the economic environment has reduced customer spending dramatically and the company believes this economic downturn will continue and therefore could have a material adverse effect on the company s future results of operations  and financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
sales returns and allowances the company s ability to collect chargebacks for deductions taken by its customers for returns  discounts and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations 
the company reserves against known chargebacks as well as potential future customer deductions based on a combination of historical activity and current market conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers and licensees to make required payments  including royalties and advertising revenues from its licensing partners 
customers include non factored accounts and credit card receivables from third party service providers 
if the financial conditions of these customers and licensees were to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets the company performs a review of its indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets for impairment on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset 
fair value on january   the company adopted certain provisions of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes the authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value and expands the required disclosures about fair value measurement 
the company s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy  which are as follows level a fair value that is derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date  level a fair value that is derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  and level a fair value that is derived from inputs that are unobservable or from observable inputs based on unobservable data in an inactive market 
income taxes the company s income taxes are routinely under audit by federal  state or local authorities 
these audits include questioning of the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on its annual evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company is required to pay amounts in excess of recorded income tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on january  which requires financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a return 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
litigation the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in and subject to compliance and regulatory reviews and audits by numerous authorities  agencies and other governmental agents and entities from various jurisdictions 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes of these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these reviews is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or final resolution in each matter  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
stock based compensation the company accounts for share based payments pursuant to sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r which requires all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
under sfas r  the company measures the cost of services received in exchange for stock options and similar awards based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognizes this cost in the income statement over the period during which an award recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the company uses the black scholes model to assess the fair value of non qualified employee stock options and amortizes this cost over the service period 
in addition  stock compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures prior to vesting primarily based on historical annual forfeiture rates and by employee classification 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed on a quarterly basis and may change based on new facts and circumstances

inventory from contract manufacturers in asia and brazil are purchased in united states dollars and the recent fluctuations of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may affect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company currently does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively low rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has marketable securities  specifically auction rate securities  that contain double a and single a rated debt obligations and a preferred share close end fund that are substantially all insured 
all of the company s auction rate securities have failed at auction as a result of illiquidity and imbalance in order flow within the market 
a failed auction is not an indication of an increased credit risk or a reduction in the underlying collateral  however  parties wishing to sell securities could not do so 
based on current market conditions  it is not known when or if the capital markets will come back into balance to achieve successful auctions for these securities 
if these auctions continue to fail  it could result in the company holding securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and will limit the liquidity of these investments 
based on the company s expected operating cash flows  and other sources and uses of cash  the company does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect its ability to execute its current business plan 
these assets have been classified as long term in the company s consolidated balance sheets and have been recorded at their fair value 
the company is exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in euros 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had no forward contracts outstanding 
the company s earnings may also be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its credit facilities 
a two or less percentage point increase in interest rates affecting the company s credit facilities would not have had a material effect on the company s and operations 
the company sources a significant amount of product from china and is subject to foreign currency exposure 
if the yuan is allowed to float freely against other foreign currency  a two percent change in exchange rates could have a material effect on the cost of future inventory purchases to be transacted by the company
