introduction istar financial inc is a publicly traded finance company focused on the commercial real estate industry 
we primarily provide custom tailored financing to high end private and corporate owners of real estate  including senior and mezzanine real estate debt  senior and mezzanine corporate capital  as well as corporate net lease financing and equity 
we are taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  and seek to generate attractive risk adjusted returns on equity to shareholders by providing innovative and value added financing solutions to our customers 
we deliver customized financial products to sophisticated real estate borrowers and corporate customers who require a high level of flexibility and service 
our two primary lines of business are lending and corporate tenant leasing 
the lending business is primarily comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that typically range in size from million to million and have maturities generally ranging from three to ten years 
these loans may be either fixed rate based on the us treasury rate plus a spread or variable rate based on libor plus a spread and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of the borrowers 
we also provide senior and subordinated capital to corporations  particularly those engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses 
these financings may be either secured or unsecured  typically range in size from million to million and have initial maturities generally ranging from three to ten years 
as part of the lending business  we also acquire whole loans  loan participations and debt securities which present attractive risk reward opportunities 
our corporate tenant leasing business provides capital to corporations and other owners who control facilities leased to single creditworthy customers 
our net leased assets are generally mission critical headquarters or distribution facilities that are subject to long term leases with public companies  many of which are rated corporate credits  and most of which provide for expenses at the facility to be paid by the corporate customer on a triple net lease basis 
corporate tenant lease  or ctl  transactions have initial terms generally ranging from to years and typically range in size from million to million 
our primary sources of revenues are interest income  which is the interest that borrowers pay on loans  and operating lease income  which is the rent that corporate customers pay to lease our ctl properties 
a smaller and more variable source of revenue is other income  which consists primarily of prepayment penalties and realized gains that occur when borrowers repay their loans before the maturity date 
we primarily generate income through the spread or margin  which is the difference between the revenues generated from loans and leases and interest expense and the cost of ctl operations 
we generally seek to match fund our revenue generating assets with either fixed or floating rate debt of a similar maturity so that changes in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve will have a minimal impact on earnings 
we began our business in through private investment funds 
in  we converted our organizational form to a maryland corporation and we replaced our former dual class common share structure with a single class of common stock 
our common stock common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange on november  prior to this date  our common stock was traded on the american stock exchange 
since that time  we have grown through the origination of new lending and leasing transactions  as well as through corporate acquisitions  including the acquisition of trinet corporate realty trust  inc in  the acquisition of falcon financial investment trust  the acquisition of a significant non controlling interest in oak hill advisors  lp and affiliates in  and the acquisition of the commercial real estate lending business and loan portfolio fremont cre of fremont investment and loan fremont  a division of fremont general corporation  in economic trends prior to  the commercial real estate industry had experienced increasing property level operating returns 
the industry attracted large amounts of investment capital which led to increased property valuations across most sectors 
investors such as pension funds and foreign buyers increased their allocations to real estate and private real estate funds  and individual investors raised record amounts of capital to invest in the sector 
at the same time  interest rates remained at historically low levels enabling many property owners to finance their assets at attractive rates 
default rates on commercial mortgages steadily declined over this prior period 
as a result  many banks and insurance companies increased their real estate lending activities and the securitization markets for commercial real estate experienced record issuance volumes and liquidity 
investors were willing to buy increasingly complex and aggressively underwritten transactions and commercial real estate valuations increased at a faster pace than underlying cash flows due to the large supply of investor capital 
beginning in mid and continuing throughout  global market volatility  disruptions in the capital markets and weakening economic conditions created an extremely challenging business environment 
the economy became substantially weaker over the course of as the u 
s housing market continued to deteriorate 
in addition  concerns about future economic growth  significant spikes in oil prices  lower consumer sentiment and spending  rising unemployment and the continued illiquidity in the corporate credit markets caused the us economy to slide into what many believe is a severe recession 
the failure or financial distress of numerous  high profile financial institutions  including bear stearns  lehman brothers  aig  fannie mae  freddie mac and washington mutual  further eroded confidence and effectively brought the credit and capital markets to a standstill 
in an effort to stave off a financial crisis  the us government is responding by providing unprecedented levels of liquidity and capital support to the financial system 
nevertheless  as a result of the current economic stress  as well as the need to preserve capital  most banks and other lending institutions have dramatically restricted credit in both the consumer and commercial sectors 
in response to the deteriorating economic conditions  the fundamentals in the commercial real estate markets became significantly weaker in the lack of liquidity in the cmbs and other commercial mortgage markets halted most sale and financing activity 
it is widely believed that commercial real estate values will be further negatively impacted by the higher cost and lack of available debt financing and softening fundamentals including higher vacancy rates and declining rents 
executive overview istar financial s unsecured  low leverage  matched funded financing model was designed to allow us to weather severe events in the macro economy and disruptions to the capital markets 
despite the financial turmoil  over the past months we have successfully raised approximately billion from capital markets transactions including unsecured debt  convertible debt  common equity and secured debt financings and in excess of billion from the sale of certain assets  including our timber portfolio 
however  the credit crisis and the subsequent economic downturn has had a negative impact on our business  financial condition and operating financial results 
the market deterioration has led to significantly reduced levels of liquidity available to finance our operations 
it has impacted our corporate credit spreads  increased our cost of funds and limited our access to the unsecured debt markets a primary source of funds for the past several years 
we have also seen our stock price decline significantly  limiting our ability to access additional equity capital 
our results of operations for were significantly impacted by the economic conditions and illiquidity in the credit markets throughout the year 
these factors also had a negative impact on our loan portfolio and the value of several of our investments and other assets 
during the year  our non performing loans increased significantly  requiring provisions for loan losses of billion versus million in and million in our total loss coverage  defined as the combination of loan loss reserves and the remaining unamortized purchase discount on the fremont cre acquisition  was billion  or of total loans  at the end of the year 
in addition  we recorded impairments totaling million reflecting significant declines in the values of several investments due to the unprecedented decline in the corporate debt markets  the write off of a majority of our goodwill and write downs on various other assets and oreo properties based on reduced fair values 
during  we were able to partially mitigate the impact of the decline in operating results and reduced liquidity through the recognition of gains and cash flow from certain asset sales and the retirement of debt at a discount 
despite the financial turmoil of the past months  during we generated more than billion of proceeds from the sale of certain assets  including our timber portfolio 
we repurchased million face amount of our senior unsecured notes  resulting in a net gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 
the impairments and additional loan loss reserves negatively impacted our financial performance  and return on common book equity and our adjusted return on common book equity in  and we realized a net loss of million and diluted loss per common share of 
we did not pay dividends on our common stock in the third and fourth quarters of  because dividends paid in the first and second quarters of were sufficient to satisfy our stated policy of paying annual dividends in amounts generally equal to of our taxable income 
as discussed in note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements  the combination of these factors has put pressure on our ability to maintain compliance with certain of our debt covenants  including our fixed charge coverage ratio and tangible net worth covenants 
these factors also have impacted our ability to continue to execute investment and financing strategies as originally planned 
in response to market conditions and liquidity pressures  we have taken and expect to continue to take steps to improve our liquidity and strengthen our balance sheet  such as asset sales  debt retirement and secured financings 
over the coming year  we will require significant capital to fund the company s investment activities  including approximately billion of unfunded loan commitments primarily associated with our construction loan portfolio 
we expect these unfunded commitments to peak in the first quarter of and then to decline throughout the course of the year  as construction on most of the projects should be completed from a construction perspective by year end 
in addition  we have debt maturities of billion for from a liquidity perspective  we expect to continue to experience significant uncertainty with respect to our sources of funds which are derived primarily from our borrower repayments  cash flow from operations and proceeds generated from asset sales 
in response  we have significantly curtailed our asset origination activities and focused on reducing operating expenses and headcount 
we will actively manage our liquidity and continually work on initiatives to address both our debt covenant compliance and our liquidity needs 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash and available capacity under our revolving credit facilities 
our unencumbered balance sheet has enabled us to generate additional liquidity through secured financing transactions and various asset sales 
to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and meet our debt maturities and funding obligations  we will need to generate proceeds from asset sales over the coming year to supplement loan repayments and cash generated from operations over the same period 
we also intend to utilize all other available sources of funds in today s financing environment  which could include additional financings secured by our assets  increased levels of asset sales  joint ventures and other third party capital 
further  to the extent our public debt securities continue to trade at significant discounts to par  we intend to utilize available funds and other strategies to retire our debt at a discount 
we believe we are in full compliance with all the covenants in our credit facilities  secured term loans and public debt securities as of december  we intend to operate our business in order to remain in compliance with such covenants  however there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
if we do not remain in compliance with debt incurrence covenants  we would be limited in our ability to incur new indebtedness other than for refinancing and other permitted incurrences 
if we fail to comply with financial maintenance covenants  the lenders under our bank facilities and the holders of our public debt securities could seek to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness if we were unable to negotiate a waiver or forbearance of the default 
our bank facilities contain cross default provisions and our public debt securities contain cross acceleration provisions with regard to financial covenant violations of other nonrecourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds 
we believe our current liquidity plan is sufficient to meet our funding and liquidity requirements 
our liquidity plan is dynamic and we expect to monitor the markets and adjust our plan as market conditions change 
if we are unable to successfully implement our plan  our financial position  debt covenant compliance  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
subsequent to year end  we received the requisite consents and commitments for a new secured facility and restructuring of existing bank facilities 
we expect that if completed  the principal amount of the new secured facility would be between million and billion 
if completed  the new secured facility would mature in june and would bear interest at a rate of libor 
lenders who participate in the new secured loan would receive collateral security for their outstanding unsecured positions in our existing unsecured bank lines  and the interest on these loans would increase to libor 
the new facilities would also provide for additional operating flexibility through the modification of certain financial covenants 
the new secured facility and the restructuring of the existing facilities are currently expected to close in march 
however  they are subject to closing conditions including the negotiation of definitive documents 
there can be no assurance that these transactions will be completed in this timeframe or at all 
key performance measures we use the following metrics to measure our profitability adjusted diluted eps  calculated as diluted adjusted earnings allocable to common shareholders divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 
see section captioned adjusted earnings for more information on adjusted earnings 
net finance margin  calculated as the rate of return on assets less the rate of cost on debt 
the rate of return on assets is the sum of interest income and operating lease income  divided by the sum of the average book value of loans and other lending investments  gross corporate tenant lease assets  purchased intangibles and assets held for sale over the period 
the rate of cost on debt is the sum of interest expense and operating costs for corporate tenant lease assets  divided by the average book value of gross debt obligations during the period 
return on average common book equity  calculated as net income loss allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders divided by average common book equity 
adjusted return on average common book equity  calculated as adjusted earnings loss allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders divided by average common book equity 
the following table summarizes these key metrics for the years ended december  adjusted diluted eps net finance margin return on average common book equity adjusted return on average common book equity explanatory notes for the years ended december   and  operating lease income used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of   and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  interest expense used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of and  respectively 
for the years ended december    and  operating costs corporate tenant lease assets used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of   and  respectively 
net finance margin for and includes the amortization of the fremont cre loan purchase discount of million and million 
excluding these charges  the net finance margin would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following is an overview of the significant factors that impacted our key performance measures and profitability as well as how those items were affected by key trends 
risk management reflects our ability to underwrite and manage our loans and leases to balance income production potential with the potential for credit losses 
during  our businesses were negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions and illiquidity in the credit markets  especially in our loan portfolio 
as a result of these factors  the credit statistics in our loan portfolio significantly deteriorated 
at december   our non performing loans represented of total assets versus in this increase in non performing loans resulted in provisions for loan losses of billion in  versus million in at december   our total loss coverage  defined as the combination of total loan loss reserves and the remaining purchase discount associated with the fremont cre acquisition  was billion  or of total loans 
the weighted average duration of the loan portfolio as of december  is years 
additionally  in  we took million of non cash impairments on debt securities in our loan portfolio that were trading well below our carrying value 
at december   the weighted average risk rating on the ctl portfolio was slightly worse than year end based on the economic factors cited above 
we continue to focus on re leasing space at our ctl facilities under longer term leases in an effort to reduce the impact of lease expirations on our earnings 
as of december   the weighted average lease term on our ctl portfolio was years and the portfolio was leased 
cost and availability of funds reflects our ability to access funding sources at competitive rates and terms and insulate our margin from changes in interest rates 
prior to the onset of the credit crisis  we continued to access the unsecured debt markets  raising billion in new bond transactions 
we also increased our unsecured revolving credit capacity through the addition of a new five year facility with a maximum capacity of billion  bringing our total unsecured revolving credit capacity to billion as of december  also on june   we closed on a billion short term interim financing facility in order to fund the fremont cre acquisition 
in the later half of  as the credit crisis took hold and became increasingly pervasive  our corporate spreads  or our cost of unsecured debt capital  increased dramatically and our access to the unsecured debt markets was limited 
in october  we successfully accessed the convertible bond market with an million offering of notes priced with a coupon of libor and a conversion premium of to our then current stock price 
in december  we issued million shares of common stock for approximately million of net proceeds 
in  liquidity in the capital markets remained severely constrained  increasing both our secured and unsecured costs of funds 
despite the financial turmoil  we were able to successfully access the unsecured debt markets in may  raising million of five year debt 
during the year we also arranged several secured financings including a million secured term loan and a million first mortgage financing secured by a pool of ctl assets 
in addition  we generated million of net proceeds from strategic sales of our timber investments and certain ctl portfolio assets 
we used a portion of the proceeds from these transactions to repay or retire corporate indebtedness 
we intend to pursue a variety of options to raise capital while the credit markets remain dislocated  including additional secured borrowings  asset sales  joint ventures with third parties and other opportunities that may become available 
we seek to match fund our assets with either fixed or floating rate debt of a similar maturity so that rising interest rates or changes in the shape of the yield curve will have a minimal impact on our earnings 
our interest rate risk management policy requires that when our variable rate debt obligations differ significantly from our variable rate lending assets  we utilize derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on our net interest margin 
we have used interest rate swaps to manage our fixed and floating rate exposure 
we also seek to match fund our foreign currency denominated assets with foreign currency denominated debt so that changes in foreign exchange rates will have a minimal impact on earnings 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are presented in our financial statements in us dollars at current exchange rates each reporting period with changes flowing through earnings 
matched assets and liabilities in the same currency are a natural hedge against currency fluctuations 
for investments denominated in currencies other than british pounds  canadian dollars and euros  we primarily use forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
expense management reflects our ability to maintain a customer oriented and cost effective operation 
we measure the efficiency of our operations by tracking our expense ratio  which is the ratio of general and administrative expenses to total revenue 
our expense ratio was and for and  respectively 
the consistency in expense ratio year over year represents a decrease in general and administrative expenses to million in from million in  resulting from the integration of the acquired fremont operations and a reduction in headcount from as of december  to as of december   in line with a decline in revenue 
management talent is one of our most significant assets and our payroll costs are correspondingly our largest non interest cash expense 
we expect to monitor the size and depth of our employee base and make adjustments based upon market conditions 
we believe that our expense ratio remains low by industry standards 
capital management reflects our ability to maintain a strong capital base through the use of prudent financial leverage 
we use an asset based capital allocation model to derive our maximum targeted corporate leverage 
we calculate our leverage as the ratio of book debt  net of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to the sum of book equity  accumulated depreciation  accumulated depletion and loan loss reserves 
our leverage was x  x and as of december   and  respectively 
we periodically evaluate our capital model target leverage levels based upon leverage levels achieved for similar assets in other markets  market liquidity levels for underlying assets and default and severity experience 
we measure our capital management by the strength of our tangible capital base and the ratio of our tangible book equity to total book assets 
our tangible book equity was billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
our ratio of tangible book equity to total book assets was  and as of december   and the decline in this ratio is attributable to our recent financial performance  including the addition of certain loan loss reserves  combined with a modest increase in prior years in financial leverage  as we moved toward our target capital level 
asset growth reflects our ability to originate new loans and leases and grow our asset base in a prudent manner 
during the later part of and throughout  as the credit and liquidity crisis took hold  the real estate financing markets came to a standstill  with little or no transaction volume 
while base interest rates remain very low  the margin  or spread on new debt transactions has widened dramatically and there has been very little new transaction volume throughout the commercial real estate industry 
we require significant capital and liquidity to fund our investment activities 
throughout  liquidity in the capital markets has been severely constrained 
in addition  the values of commercial real estate properties have declined during the year and delinquency rates of commercial real estate loans have been increasing 
based on these factors we have significantly curtailed our asset origination activities 
during  we generated million of transaction volume representing financing commitments 
transaction volume for the years ended december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
we completed and financing commitments in and  respectively 
the majority of fundings in represent unfunded commitments related to our existing loans  ctl s and other lending investments that we may have been required to fund 
over the past several years  while property level fundamentals were stable or improving  investment activity in direct real estate ownership increased dramatically 
in many cases  this caused property valuations to increase disproportionately to any corresponding improvement in fundamentals 
throughout  and as a direct result of the declining economic credit and liquidity environment  the market for corporate tenant leases  or net leased properties  has slowed down significantly 
as a result  we have not invested as heavily in this asset class  acquiring only million in  versus million in  and million in results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  change change in thousands interest income operating lease income other income total revenue interest expense operating costs corporate tenant lease assets depreciation and amortization general and administrative provision for loan losses impairment of goodwill impairment of other assets other expense total costs and expenses gain on early extinguishment of debt gain on sale of joint venture interest  net of minority interest earnings from equity method investments income from discontinued operations gain from discontinued operations  net of minority interest revenue the million decrease in total revenue during when compared to was primarily due to lower interest income 
interest income decreased primarily due to the increasing level of non performing loans within the portfolio throughout the year 
in addition  interest income on our variable rate lending investments decreased as a result of the interest rate environment  with the average one month libor rates decreasing to in  compared to in offsetting these trends was a full year of interest income in from the loans acquired from fremont  compared to only six months of income in operating lease income increased by million to million during from million for the same period in the increase is primarily attributable to new ctl investments 
other income was million lower in than in  primarily resulting from a decrease in prepayment penalties  partially offset by increases in income from strategic equity investments and other miscellaneous income 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased by approximately billion from to due primarily to significant provisions for loan losses and non cash asset impairment charges 
the million increase in our provision for loan losses is primarily due to additional asset specific reserves that were required as a result of the significant increase in non performing loans during this significant increase in impaired loans  particularly in our residential land development and condominium construction portfolios  was driven by the weakening economy and the dislocation of the credit markets  which has adversely impacted the ability of our borrowers to service their debt and refinance their loans at maturity 
these changes are further described in the risk management and executive overview sections 
during  we recorded million in non cash impairment charges related to various assets including certain debt securities  assets held in our other investment portfolio  oreo assets  intangible assets  and a ctl asset 
included in that amount is million of impairments for certain held to maturity and available for sale securities in our loans and other lending investments portfolio that were trading below their carrying value 
another million related to two cost method equity investments included in our other investments portfolio 
continued deterioration in the commercial real estate market caused us to record million in impairments of certain oreo assets to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their revised estimated fair values less costs to sell 
we also recorded impairments totaling million on our intangible assets  of which million related to the fremont cre acquisition  to reduce their carrying values to their revised estimated fair values 
also included in non cash impairments in is million related to a single ctl asset that was impaired because of a decline in value caused by deteriorating sub market conditions and lower than expected rents in surrounding areas 
in june  due to an overall deterioration in market conditions within the commercial real estate lending environment  we determined our goodwill was impaired and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million  eliminating the goodwill in our real estate lending reporting unit 
interest expense increased from to primarily due to higher average outstanding borrowings during  partially offset by decreased interest rates on our borrowings 
our average outstanding debt balance increased to billion in from billion in through new bond issuances in and  increased borrowings on our unsecured and secured revolving credit facilities as well as the new secured term loans 
higher borrowings were partially offset by lower average rates  which decreased to in as compared to in  primarily as a result of lower libor rates 
operating costs corporate tenant lease assets decreased by million primarily due to increased property expense recoveries from tenants leasing our properties 
other expense in included million primarily related to ineffectiveness associated with our various derivative instruments 
the remaining million related to costs associated with oreo properties that we took title to through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in and depreciation and amortization increased by million as a result of the acquisition and construction of new ctl assets in the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower payroll and employee related costs resulting from a reduction in headcount from as of december  to as of december  other components of net income gain on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december   we retired million par value of our senior unsecured notes through open market repurchases  resulting in an aggregate net gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
gain on sale of joint venture interest  net of minority interest in april  we closed on the sale of our timberstar southwest joint venture for a gross sales price of billion  including the assumption of debt 
we received net proceeds of approximately million for our interest in the venture and recorded a gain of million  net of minority interest 
earnings from equity method investments earnings from equity method investments decreased to million in from million in due to several factors 
during  losses were recorded on several of our equity method investments due to volatility in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions 
this was partially offset by the sale of our timberstar southwest joint venture  as described above 
our share of losses from this venture prior to the sale were million for the year ended december  compared to losses of million during the same period in in addition  during  as the result of an investee liquidating its remaining assets and winding down its business  we recognized million of income 
income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  operating results for ctl and timberstar assets sold during the period or assets held for sale at the end of are classified as discontinued operations 
the decrease in income from discontinued operations is primarily due to the inclusion of more income in for ctl and timberstar assets sold in and gain from discontinued operations  net of minority interest during the year ended december   we sold a portfolio of ctl assets to one buyer and also seventeen ctl assets to different buyers for net aggregate proceeds of million  and recognized gains of approximately million 
in addition  we also closed on the sale of our maine timber property for net proceeds of million resulting in a gain of million  net of minority interest 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  change change in thousands interest income operating lease income other income total revenue interest expense operating costs corporate tenant lease assets depreciation and amortization general and administrative provision for loan losses impairment of other assets other expense total costs and expenses gain on early extinguishment of debt earnings from equity method investments income from discontinued operations gain from discontinued operations  net of minority interest revenue the increase in total revenue during was primarily due to increased interest income 
interest income from the loans acquired from fremont cre contributed million to the increase  including million from the amortization of purchase discount on the acquired loans 
the remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to a billion increase in the average outstanding balance of loans and other lending investments during excluding the acquired loan portfolio 
the average rate of return on our loans and lending investments increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to higher average yields on the acquired fremont cre loans that resulted from purchasing the loans at a discount 
during  our operating lease income grew by million which was attributable to new ctl investments  offset by million of lower operating lease income due to terminated leases  vacancies and lower rental rates on certain ctl assets 
other income was million higher in than in  primarily resulting from an increase in prepayment penalties  partially offset by decreases in income from timber operations and income from other investments 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased by approximately million from to due to significant increases in various line items including interest expense  provision for loan losses  impairment of other assets and general and administrative costs 
interest expense increased from to primarily due to higher average outstanding borrowings during  partially offset by decreased interest rates on our borrowings 
our average outstanding debt balance increased to billion in from billion in through new bond issuances early in  as well as  through increased borrowings on our existing and our unsecured revolving credit facilities 
in addition  we financed the fremont cre acquisition with proceeds from an interim financing facility and then subsequently repaid a portion of that balance with proceeds from a convertible bond issuance and equity issuance in the fourth quarter of weighted average interest rates on our outstanding debt decreased to in as compared to in this decrease is attributable to increased borrowings on our lower rate unsecured revolving credit facilities and our interim financing facility in the million increase in our provision for loan losses was attributed both to the addition of asset specific reserves as well as negative trends in the overall economy  growth in our historical portfolio and our newly acquired loan portfolio  as further described in the risk management section 
impairment of other assets includes million of impairments recorded on certain held to maturity securities in our loans and other lending investments portfolio were trading below their carrying value 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million from to due to a number of contributing factors 
our payroll and payroll related costs increased by approximately million resulting from overall headcount growth  including million of payroll and payroll related costs attributed to the employees hired as part of the fremont cre acquisition 
excluding payroll related costs  the fremont cre acquisition added another million to our general and administrative expense  of which million represented one time costs and integration expenses 
stock based compensation also increased by approximately million in as compared to  primarily related to new restricted stock units granted in  partially offset by the one time hpu compensation charge taken in additionally  included in is million of management and start up fees associated with the ramp up of one of our european ventures in other factors contributing to the remaining increase in general and administrative costs include higher tax expense for trs entities  primarily related to our oak hill joint venture income  abandoned pursuit costs and legal fees 
depreciation and amortization increased by million from to  marginally contributing to the overall increase in total costs and expenses 
this increase relates primarily to the acquisitions and improvements of ctl assets in other components of net income earnings from equity method investments earnings from equity method investments increased to million in from million in  primarily due to an increase of million in income from our oak hill investments and million of income from an investee that sold its remaining assets and wound down its business 
increases in income from other strategic investments totaling million were mostly offset by million of increased losses from timberstar southwest 
our million share of losses from timberstar southwest in included our million share of depreciation  depletion and amortization from the venture 
income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  operating results for ctl and timberstar assets sold during the period or during are reclassified as discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations decreased from to primarily due to the inclusion of more income in for assets sold during and gain from discontinued operations  net of minority interest we sold eight and ten ctl assets and realized gains of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
adjusted earnings we measure our performance using adjusted earnings in addition to net income 
adjusted earnings represent net income allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  depletion  amortization  gain from discontinued operations  ineffectiveness on interest rate hedges  impairments of goodwill and intangible assets  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
adjustments for joint ventures reflect our share of adjusted earnings calculated on the same basis 
we believe that adjusted earnings is a helpful measure to consider  in addition to net income  because this measure helps us to evaluate how our commercial real estate finance business is performing compared to other commercial finance companies  without the effects of certain gaap adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of current operating performance 
the most significant gaap adjustments that we exclude in determining adjusted earnings are depreciation  depletion and amortization  and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets which are typically non cash charges 
we do not exclude non cash impairment charges on tangible assets or provisions for loan loss reserves 
as a commercial finance company that focuses on real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing  we record significant depreciation on our real estate assets  depletion on our timber assets and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our borrowings 
depreciation  depletion and amortization do not affect our daily operations  but they do impact financial results under gaap 
by measuring our performance using adjusted earnings and net income  we are able to evaluate how our business is performing both before and after giving effect to recurring gaap adjustments such as depreciation  depletion and amortization including earnings from joint venture interests on the same basis and excluding impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and gains or losses from the sale of assets that will no longer be part of continuing operations 
adjusted earnings is not an alternative or substitute for net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
rather  we believe that adjusted earnings is an additional measure that helps us analyze how our business is performing 
this measure is also used to track compliance with covenants in certain of our material borrowing arrangements that have covenants based upon this measure

risk management loan credit statistics the table below summarizes our non performing loans and details the reserve for loan losses associated with our loans as of december  in thousands non performing loans carrying value participated portion managed loan value as a percentage of managed loan value of total loans watch list loans carrying value participated portion managed loan value reserve for loan losses as a percentage of managed loan value of total loans as a percentage of managed loan value of non performing loans other real estate owned carrying value explanatory note managed loan value of a loan is computed by adding istar s carrying value of the loan and the participation interest sold on the fremont cre portfolio 
the participation  receives of all loan principal payments  including principal that we have funded 
therefore  istar is in the first loss position and we believe that presentation of the managed loan value is more relevant than a presentation of our carrying value when discussing our risk of loss on the loans in the fremont cre portfolio 
non performing loans we designate loans as non performing at such time as management determines the borrower is incapable of  or has ceased efforts towards  curing the cause of an impairment  the loan becomes days delinquent  or the loan has a maturity default 
all non performing loans are placed on non accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt 
as of december   we had non performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of billion and an aggregate managed loan value of billion  or of the total managed loan value of total loans 
our non performing loans increased materially through  particularly in our residential land development and condominium construction portfolios  due to the worsening economy and the seizure of the credit markets  which have adversely impacted the ability of many of our borrowers to service their debt and refinance our loans at maturity 
due to the continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market  the process of estimating collateral values and reserves will continue to require significant judgment on the part of management 
management currently believes there is adequate collateral and reserves to support the book values of the loans 
watch list assets we conduct a quarterly comprehensive credit review  resulting in an individual risk rating being assigned to each asset in our portfolio 
this review is designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively manage asset specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a portfolio wide basis as an early warning system 
as of december   we had assets on the credit watch list  excluding non performing loans above  with an aggregate carrying value of billion and an aggregate managed loan value of billion  or of the managed loan value of total loans 
reserve for loan losses during the year ended december   the reserve for loan losses increased million  which was the result of billion of provisioning for loan losses reduced by million of charge offs 
the reserve is increased through the provision for loan losses  which reduces income in the period recorded and is reduced through charge offs 
the reserve for loan losses includes an asset specific component and a formula based component 
an asset specific reserve is established for a non performing loan when the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral less costs to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
as of december   we had million of asset specific reserves related to non performing loans as compared to million of asset specific reserves related to non performing loans at december  the increase in asset specific reserves during the year ended december  was primarily due to the significant increase in non performing loans as discussed above 
the increase was also due to additional reserves required for existing non performing loans further impacted by the continued deterioration in the commercial real estate market 
the formula based general reserve is derived from estimated probabilities of principal loss and loss given default severities assigned to the portfolio during our quarterly internal risk rating assessment 
probabilities of principal loss and severity factors are based on industry and or internal experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  based on our judgment  impact the collectability of the loans as of the balance sheet date 
the general reserve was million as of december   and has increased from million at december  other real estate owned oreo during the year ended december   we received title to properties in satisfaction of senior mortgage loans with cumulative carrying values of million  for which those properties had served as collateral  and recorded charge offs totaling million related to these loans 
due to changing market conditions  we determined certain oreo assets were impaired and recorded impairment charges of million for the year ended december  in addition  during the year ended december   we sold oreo assets for net proceeds of million and recognized net losses of million 
liquidity and capital resources our unsecured  low leverage  match funded financing model was designed to allow us to weather severe events in the macro economy and disruptions to the capital markets 
despite the financial turmoil  over the past months  we have successfully raised approximately billion from capital markets transactions including unsecured debt  convertible debt  common equity and secured debt financings  and in excess of billion from the sale of certain assets  including our timber portfolio 
however  the credit crisis has significantly impacted our corporate credit spreads  increasing our cost of funds and limiting our access to the unsecured debt markets our primary source of funds for the past several years 
we have also seen our stock price decline significantly  limiting our ability to access additional equity capital 
as of december   we had million of cash and available capacity under our billion revolving credit facilities 
the current financial turmoil in the market and lack of capital in the real estate sector has also impacted our borrowers ability to service their debt and refinance their loans as they mature 
in addition  our loan portfolio includes a large percentage of residential construction loans 
many of our borrowers are experiencing a slowdown in residential sales due to falling home prices and tightening of the residential mortgage market 
proceeds from these residential sales are generally used to repay principal on our loans 
as a result  we have experienced and continue to experience significant uncertainty with respect to our ability to predict the amounts and timing of our loan repayments an important source of funds for our business 
primarily as a result of our borrowers inability to repay their loans  we have experienced a significant increase in our non performing loans over the past months 
our accounting policies require us to stop accruing interest on our non performing loans and to take asset specific reserves if we do not believe we will be able to recover our entire principal 
the increase in our non performing loans has reduced the income and increased the expense associated with these loans  putting pressure on some of our financial covenants  including our fixed charge coverage ratio and our tangible net worth covenants 
to date  we have been able to mitigate the impact of increased expenses associated with our loan loss reserves through the gains associated with certain asset sales and the discounted retirement of debt 
over the coming year  we will require significant capital to fund our investment activities  including approximately billion to fund outstanding loan commitments associated with our construction loan portfolio 
we expect these unfunded commitments to peak in the first quarter of and then to decline throughout the course of the year  as most of the projects will be completed from a construction perspective by year end 
in addition  we have significant debt maturities in  totaling approximately billion 
our capital sources in today s financing environment include repayments from our loan assets  asset sales  financings secured by our assets  additional term borrowings  borrowings under our lines of credit  cash flow from operations and potential joint ventures 
historically we have also issued unsecured corporate debt  convertible debt and preferred and common equity however current market conditions have effectively eliminated our access to these sources of capital in the near term 
we actively manage our liquidity and continually work on initiatives to address both our debt covenant compliance and our liquidity needs 
our unencumbered balance sheet has enabled us to generate additional liquidity through various asset sales 
we expect proceeds from asset sales over the coming year to supplement loan repayments over the same period 
we continue to execute on our liquidity plan by analyzing additional asset sales and secured financing alternatives in order to maintain adequate liquidity for the balance of the year and position us for long term future growth and profitability 
we believe our current liquidity plan is sufficient to meet our funding and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
our liquidity plan is dynamic and we expect to monitor the markets and adjust our plan as market conditions change 
there is a risk that we will not be able to meet all of our funding and debt service obligations 
management s failure to successfully implement our liquidity plan could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and covenant compliance  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing will depend in part on our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our unsecured credit facilities and our publicly held debt securities  as further described in the debt covenants section below 
in addition  any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with additional financing will depend upon a number of other factors  such as our compliance with the terms of existing credit arrangements  our financial performance  our credit ratings  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
subsequent to year end  we received the requisite consents and commitments for a new secured facility and restructuring of existing bank facilities 
we expect that if completed  the principal amount of the new secured facility would be between million and billion 
if completed  the new secured facility would mature in june and would bear interest at a rate of libor 
lenders who participate in the new secured loan would receive collateral security for their outstanding unsecured positions in our existing unsecured bank lines  and the interest on these loans would increase to libor 
the new facilities would also provide for additional operating flexibility through the modification of certain financial covenants 
the new secured facility and the restructuring of the existing facilities are currently expected to close in march 
however  they are subject to closing conditions including the negotiation of definitive documents 
there can be no assurance that these transactions will be completed in this timeframe or at all

capital markets activity during the year ended december   we retired  through open market repurchases  million par value of our senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from january to march in connection with these repurchases  we recorded an aggregate net gain on early extinguishment of debt of approximately million for the year ended december  we also repaid the senior notes due august and the senior notes and libor senior notes due march in may  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at an annual rate of and maturing in june we used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities primarily to repay outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
simultaneous with the issuance of this debt  we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap the fixed interest rate on the million senior unsecured notes for a variable interest rate 
during the year ended december   we terminated the swaps associated with these notes 
during the year ended december   we issued million and million aggregate principal amounts of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at annual rates of and and maturing in and  respectively  and million of variable rate senior notes bearing interest at three month libor maturing in we primarily used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to repay outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facilities 
in connection with this issuance  we settled forward starting interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million and ten year terms matching that of the million senior notes due in we also entered into interest rate swap agreements to swap the fixed interest rate on the million senior notes due in for a variable interest rate 
during the year ended december   we terminated the swaps associated with these notes 
in addition  on october   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior floating rate notes due convertible notes 
the convertible notes were issued at par  mature on october   and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to three month libor 
the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness 
we used million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under the interim financing facility which we used to fund the fremont cre acquisition 
we used the balance of the net proceeds to repay other outstanding indebtedness 
the convertible notes are convertible at the option of the holders  into approximately shares per  principal amount of convertible notes  on or after august   or prior to that date if the price of our common stock trades above of the conversion price for a specified duration  the trading price of the convertible notes is below a certain threshold  subject to specified exceptions  the convertible notes have been called for redemption  or specified corporate transactions have occurred 
none of the conversion triggers have been met as of december  the conversion rate is subject to certain adjustments 
the conversion rate initially represents a conversion price of per share 
if the conditions for conversion are met  we may choose to pay in cash and or common stock  however  if this occurs  we have the intent and ability to settle this debt in cash 
in addition  our million of libor senior notes matured in march on january   in connection with a consent solicitation of the holders of the respective notes  we amended certain covenants in our senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  senior notes due  and senior notes due collectively  the modified notes 
holders of approximately of the aggregate principal amount of the modified notes consented to the solicitation 
the purpose of the amendments was to conform most of the covenants to the covenants contained in the indentures governing the senior notes we issued after we had achieved an investment grade rating from s p  moody s and fitch 
in connection with the consent solicitation we paid an aggregate fee of million to the consenting note holders  which will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the modified notes 
in addition  we incurred advisory and professional fees aggregating million  which were expensed and included in general and administrative on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  other financing activity during the second quarter of  we closed on a million secured term note maturing in april this note is collateralized by properties in our corporate tenant lease portfolio and bears interest at the greater of or libor 
in march  we entered into a million senior secured term loan maturing in march with a six month extension at our option 
borrowings under this financing bear interest at a rate of libor and are collateralized by assets in our loans and other lending investments portfolio 
in addition  in march  we closed on a million secured term loan maturing in march this loan is collateralized by four assets in our corporate tenant lease portfolio and bears interest at libor 
during  our term financing that was collateralized by corporate bonds matured on august  and was extended consecutively  with varying interest rates  through november  when it was repaid 
as of december   future scheduled maturities of outstanding long term debt obligations are as follows in thousands thereafter total principal maturities unamortized debt discounts  net total long term debt obligations explanatory note assumes exercise of extensions to the extent such extensions are at our option 
hedging activities we have variable rate lending assets and variable rate debt obligations 
these assets and liabilities create a natural hedge against changes in variable interest rates 
this means that  as interest rates increase  we earn more on our variable rate lending assets and pay more on our variable rate debt obligations and  conversely  as interest rates decrease  we earn less on our variable rate lending assets and pay less on our variable rate debt obligations 
when our variable rate debt obligations differ significantly from our variable rate lending assets  we utilize derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on our net income 
our interest rate risk management policy requires that we enter into hedging transactions when it is determined  based on sensitivity models  that the impact of various increasing or decreasing interest rate scenarios could have a significant negative effect on our net interest income 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the derivative instruments we use are typically in the form of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
interest rate swaps can effectively either convert variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations or convert fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations 
interest rate caps effectively limit the maximum interest rate payable on variable rate debt obligations 
in addition we also use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
developing an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we also seek to match fund our assets denominated in foreign currencies so that changes in foreign exchange rates will have a minimal impact on earnings 
foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are presented in our financial statements in us dollars at current exchange rates each reporting period with changes related to foreign currency fluctuations flowing through earnings 
for investments denominated in currencies other than british pounds  canadian dollars and euros  we primarily use forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the primary risks related to our use of derivative instruments are the risks that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement could default on their obligation and the risk that we may have to pay certain costs  such as transaction fees or breakage costs  if we terminate a hedging arrangement 
as a matter of policy  we enter into hedging arrangements with counterparties that are large  creditworthy financial institutions typically rated at least a a by s p and moody s  respectively 
our hedging strategy is monitored by our audit committee on behalf of the board of directors and may be changed without shareholder approval 
as of december   we had pay floating interest rate swaps that hedge the change in fair value associated with million of outstanding fixed rate debt 
these swaps were de designated during and no longer qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no

as a result of the terminations  we recorded million of losses  during the year ended december  in addition  during we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  with notional amounts totaling million and variable interest rates that reset quarterly based on three month libor 
these swap agreements were entered into in order to exchange the fixed rate interest payments on our million senior notes due in for variable rate interest payments based on three month libor 
these swaps were terminated in as described below 
during the year ended december   we terminated billion of pay floating interest rate swaps  that were designated as fair value hedges 
as a result of the terminations  we received million of cash and a recorded receivable of million 
in addition  as of december   our senior notes include premiums related to changes in the fair value of the debt while it was hedged by the interest rate swaps 
the premiums will be amortized over the lives of the respective debt as an offset to interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded million as an offset to interest expense related to the amortization of the premiums 
during the year ended december   we settled forward starting interest rate swap agreements  which were designated as cash flow hedges and had notional amounts totaling million  in connection with our issuance of million of senior notes due in the million settlement value received for these forward starting swaps was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income losses on our consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations through the maturity of the senior notes due in in addition  during we entered into interest rate swap agreements  designated as fair value hedges  with notional amounts totaling million and variable interest rates that reset quarterly based on three month libor 
these swap agreements exchanged the fixed rate interest payments on our million senior notes due in for variable rate interest payments based on three month libor 
these swaps were terminated in as described above 
additionally  during we recorded a non cash charge of million to correct the fair value of three fair value interest rate swaps that we determined did not qualify for hedge accounting within the provisions of sfas no 
the charge reflects a cumulative loss in the fair value of the swaps from the time they were entered into through june   and was recorded as an increase to debt obligations and other expense on our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations  respectively 
we concluded that the amount of gains and losses that should have been previously recorded for these swaps were not material to any of our previously issued financial statements 
we also concluded that the million cumulative charge was not material to the quarter or fiscal year in which the charge was booked 
as such  the out of period charge was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   rather than restating prior periods

the interest rate caps were not designated as hedges under sfas no

in addition  for the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of million for interest rate swaps not designated as hedges under sfas no 
all of these amounts were recorded in other expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
off balance sheet transactions we are not dependent on the use of any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
we have certain discretionary and non discretionary unfunded commitments related to our loans  ctls and other lending investments that we may be required to  or choose to  fund in the future 
discretionary commitments are those under which we have sole discretion with respect to future funding 
non discretionary commitments are those that we are generally obligated to fund at the request of the borrower or upon the occurrence of events outside of our direct control 
as of december   we had loans with unfunded commitments totaling billion  of which million was discretionary and billion was non discretionary 
in addition  we had million of non discretionary unfunded commitments related to three ctl investments 
these commitments generally fall into two categories pre approved capital improvement projects  and new or additional construction costs 
upon completion of the improvements or construction  we would receive additional operating lease income from the customers 
in addition  we have million of non discretionary unfunded commitments related to four existing customers in the form of tenant improvements which were negotiated with the customers at the commencement of the leases 
further  we had strategic investments with unfunded non discretionary commitments of million 
debt covenants our ability to borrow under our unsecured credit facilities  secured credit facility  and secured term loan is dependent on maintaining compliance with various covenants  including minimum net worth as well as specified financial ratios such as fixed charge coverage  unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness  and leverage 
all of the covenants on the facilities are maintenance covenants and  if breached  could result in an acceleration of our facilities if a waiver or modification is not agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the unsecured lending group and the lenders on the other facilities 
our publicly held debt securities also contain covenants for fixed charge coverage and unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness 
the fixed charge coverage ratio in our publicly held securities is an incurrence test 
if we do not meet the fixed charge coverage ratio  our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be restricted 
the unencumbered asset to unsecured indebtedness covenant is a maintenance covenant and  if breached and not cured within applicable cure periods  it could result in acceleration of our publicly held debt unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the bondholders 
based on our unsecured credit ratings at december   the financial covenants in our publicly held debt securities  including the fixed charge coverage ratio and maintenance of unencumbered assets compared to unsecured indebtedness  are operative 
our bank facilities and our public debt securities contain cross default provisions which would allow the lenders and the bondholders to declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if we fail to pay amounts due in respect of our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds 
in addition  our bank facilities and the indentures governing our public debt securities provide that the lenders and bondholders may declare an event of default and accelerate our indebtedness to them if there is a nonpayment default under our other recourse indebtedness in excess of specified thresholds and  if the holders of the other indebtedness are permitted to accelerate  in the case of the bank facilities  or accelerate  in the case of the bond indentures  the other recourse indebtedness 
we believe we are in full compliance with the covenants in our credit facilities  secured term loans and public debt securities as of december  our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants will be impacted by increases in loan loss reserves  non performing loans and the amount and timing of cash repayments from borrowers 
see below for further discussion of ratings triggers as they relate to our covenants 
our million aggregate principal amount of outstanding convertible debt securities provide that we must offer to repurchase the securities from the holders at of their par value plus accrued and unpaid interest if our common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange 
ratings triggers the two committed unsecured revolving credit facilities aggregating billion that we had in place at december   bear interest at libor per annum based on our senior unsecured debt ratings of bbb from s p  ba from moody s and bb from fitch at the end of the year 
our ability to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facilities is not dependent on our credit ratings 
the interest rate that we incur on borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities is based on the higher of our credit ratings from s p and moody s 
additional downgrades could further increase our borrowing rates under these facilities to a maximum of libor per annum 
our million secured term loan interest rate spread will reset on march  based on our corporate credit rating at that time 
if our rating from any two of s p  moody s and fitch is at bbb baa or below bbb baa then the margin will be increased by or  respectively 
as of december   our interest rate on the secured term loan was libor 
based on our current credit ratings  the interest rate on this loan will reset at libor on march  except as described above  there are no other ratings triggers in any of our debt instruments or other operating or financial agreements at december  transactions with related parties we have substantial investments in minority interests of oak hill advisors  lp  oak hill credit alpha mgp  ohsf gp partners ii  llc  oak hill credit opportunities mgp  llc  ohsf gp partners investors  llc  oha finance mgp  llc  oha capital solutions mgp  llc  oha strategic credit genpar  llc and oha leveraged loan portfolio genpar  llc see note to the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for more detail

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods  including any judgments made as part of such methods  are well controlled  reviewed and applied consistently from period to period 
we base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and  therefore  routinely require adjustment 
during  management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses is a valuation allowance that reflects management s estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the reserve is increased through the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statements of operations and is decreased by charge offs when losses are confirmed through the receipt of assets such as cash in a pre foreclosure sale or via ownership control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure or when significant collection efforts have ceased 
the reserve for loan losses includes a formula based component and an asset specific component 
the formula based reserve component covers performing loans and provisions for loan losses are recorded when i available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and ii the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 

required reserve balances for the performing loan portfolio are derived from estimated probabilities of principal loss and loss given default severities 
estimated probabilities of principal loss and loss severities are assigned to each loan in the portfolio during our quarterly internal risk rating assessment 
probabilities of principal loss and severity factors are based on industry and or internal experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that  based on our judgment  impact the collectability of the loans as of the balance sheet date 
the asset specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on loans considered impaired and measured pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairments of a loan an amendment of fasb statement no 
and  sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 we consider a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a reserve is established when the present value of payments expected to be received  observable market prices  or the estimated fair value of the collateral for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment of an impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
a loan is also considered impaired in accordance with sfas if its terms are modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
each of our non performing loans npl s and tdr loans are considered impaired and are evaluated individually to determine required asset specific reserves 
the provision for loan losses for the years ended december   and were billion  million and million  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to increased asset specific reserves required as a result of the increase in impaired loans 
the total reserve for loan losses at december  and  included sfas no 
asset specific reserves of million and million  respectively  and sfas no 
general reserves of million and million  respectively 
impairment of available for sale and held to maturity debt securities for held to maturity and available for sale debt securities held in loans and other lending investments  management evaluates whether the asset is other than temporarily impaired when the fair market value is below carrying value 
we consider the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been below carrying value  our intent and ability to hold the security to maturity or for available for sale securities  until recovery and other market factors 
if it is determined that an impairment exists that is other than temporary  the unrealized loss will be charged against earnings as an impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december  and  we determined that unrealized losses on held to maturity and available for sale securities were other than temporary and recorded impairment charges totaling million and million  respectively 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure in partial or total satisfaction of non performing loans 
oreo obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell at the date of transfer 
the excess of the carrying value of the loan over the fair value of the property less estimated costs to sell is charged off to the reserve for loan losses when title to the property is obtained 
net revenues and costs of holding the property are recorded in other expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
significant property improvements may be capitalized to the extent that the carrying value of the property does not exceed the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the gain or loss on final disposition of an oreo is recorded in impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations  and is considered income loss from continuing operations because it represents the final stage of our loan collection process 
we also review the recoverability of an oreo s carrying value when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment of a property s value 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property less cost to sell 
these charges are recorded in impairment of other assets on the consolidated statements of operations 
during the years ended december  and  respectively  we received titles to properties in satisfaction of senior mortgage loans with cumulative carrying values of million and million  for which those properties had served as collateral  and recorded charge offs totaling million and million related to these loans 
subsequent to taking title to the properties  we determined certain oreo assets were impaired due to changing market conditions  and recorded impairment charges of million during the year ended december  long lived assets impairment test in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 ctl assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell and are included in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 
the difference between the estimated fair value less costs to sell and the carrying value will be recorded as an impairment charge 
once the asset is classified as held for sale  depreciation expense is no longer recorded and historical operating results are reclassified to income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
we periodically review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
a held for use long lived asset s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows discounted and without interest charges to be generated by the asset taking into account the anticipated holding period of the asset is less than the carrying value 
such estimate of cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset and reflected as an adjustment to the basis of the asset 
impairments of ctl assets are recorded in impairment of other assets  on our consolidated statements of operations 
during  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to a single ctl asset due to deteriorating market conditions and lower than expected rents in the surrounding area 
identified intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 upon the acquisition of a business  we record intangible assets acquired at their estimated fair values separate and apart from goodwill 
we determine whether such intangible assets have finite or indefinite lives 
as of december   all such acquired intangible assets have finite lives 
we amortize finite lived intangible assets based on the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the business acquired 
we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if we determine the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable it will record an impairment charge to the extent its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
impairments of intangibles are recorded in impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired including identified intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test is done at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
due to an overall deterioration in market conditions within the commercial real estate lending environment  we determined that it was necessary to evaluate goodwill for impairment as of june  at june   we estimated the fair value of our real estate lending reporting unit using a market based valuation and determined that goodwill was potentially impaired 
we then estimated the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit based on an analysis of discounted cash flows 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million during the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of goodwill within the real estate lending reporting unit to zero 
this charge was recorded in impairment of goodwill  on our consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   we also recorded non cash charges of million to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible asset  related to the fremont cre acquisition and other acquisitions  based on their revised estimated fair values 
these charges were recorded in impairment of other assets on our consolidated statements of operations 
consolidation variable interest entities we invest in many entities where we either own a minority interest or may have a majority interest  but do not have voting control of the entity 
we must evaluate these types of interests to determine if the entity is a variable interest entity vie  and if we are the primary beneficiary  as defined in fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 fin r 
there is a significant amount of judgment required in interpreting the provisions of fin r and applying them to specific transactions 
in order to determine if an entity is considered a vie and if we are the primary beneficiary  we first perform a qualitative analysis  which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment  including  but not limited to  the nature and structure of the entity  the variability of the economic interests that the entity passes along to its interest holders  the rights of the parties and the purpose of the arrangement 
an iterative quantitative analysis is required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a vie or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required 
fair value of assets and liabilities on january   we adopted sfas no 
which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell the financial asset or paid to transfer the financial liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
for financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data 
for example  reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable 
therefore  when market data is not available  we would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion on our use of fair valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities and the related measurement techniques 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no

fsp fas and fin r are effective for annual and interim periods ending after december  we have adopted this fsp as of december  see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas  which clarifies how the fair value of a financial instrument is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive 
the fsp was effective upon issuance  however  the adoption did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two class method as described in sfas no 
 earnings per share 
under the guidance in fsp eitf  unvested share based payment awards  that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
fsp eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
all prior period eps data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively including interim financial statements  summaries of earnings  and selected financial data to conform to the provisions of this fsp 
early application is not permitted 
we will adopt this standard on january   as required  and will present the unvested restricted stock units as another class of security in our earnings per share 
we currently expect the adoption of fsp eitf to have an impact to basic and diluted earnings per share for common and hpu shareholders 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb 
this new standard requires the initial proceeds from convertible debt that may be settled in cash to be bifurcated between a liability component and an equity component 
the objective of the guidance is to require the liability and equity components of convertible debt to be separately accounted for in a manner such that the interest expense recorded on the convertible debt would not equal the contractual rate of interest on the convertible debt  but instead would be recorded at a rate that would reflect the issuer s conventional non convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance 
this is accomplished through the creation of a discount on the debt that would be accreted using the effective interest method as additional non cash interest expense over the period the debt is expected to remain outstanding 
the provisions of fsp apb will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt this standard on january   as required 
management expects that the fsp will have an impact on our million convertible debt and  upon adoption  have an impact on debt carrying value  beginning retained earnings and future non cash interest expense 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
for an entity to consider  when determining the useful life of an acquired intangible asset  whether the intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modifications to the existing terms and conditions associated with the intangible asset 
fsp fas replaces the previous useful life assessment criteria with a requirement that an entity considers its own experience in renewing similar arrangements 
if the entity has no relevant experience  it would consider market participant assumptions regarding renewal 
fsp fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing our business plan  the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with our liability management objectives  we have implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
we also seek to match fund our foreign denominated assets with foreign denominated debt so that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have a minimal impact on earnings 
our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on our interest bearing assets  which we may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of our interest bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of our interest earning assets if borrowers refinance our loans 
approximately of our loan investments are subject to prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to us 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while we generally seek to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  we could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risks in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us which adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond our control 
as fully discussed in note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements  we employ match funding based financing and hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  swaps and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce our exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in our credit risk or the credit risk of our borrowers 
each interest rate cap agreement is a legal contract between us and a third party the counterparty 
when we purchase a cap contract  we make an up front payment to the counterparty and the counterparty agrees to make payments to us in the future should the reference rate typically one  three or six month libor rise above cap agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
each contract has a notional face amount 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  we will earn cap income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
we utilize the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to such instruments 
sfas no 
provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income and are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations in the affected period 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
our swaps are either pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of variable rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from us or pay floating swaps involving the exchange of fixed rate interest payments from the counterparty for variable rate interest payments from us  which mitigates the risk of changes in fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate futures are contracts  generally settled in cash  in which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date the cash equivalent of the difference between the specified price or yield indicated in the contract and the value of the specified instrument ie  ie treasury securities upon settlement 
under these agreements  we would generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments would be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  we would cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
while a reit may utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets without generating non qualifying income  use of derivatives for other purposes will generate non qualified income for reit income test purposes 
this includes hedging asset related risks such as credit  foreign exchange and prepayment or interest rate exposure on our loan assets 
as a result our ability to hedge these types of risks is limited 
there can be no assurance that our profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
we are potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  we do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract we enter into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income and net fair value of financial instruments should interest rates increase by or basis points and decrease by basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases and earnings from equity method investments  less interest expense  operating costs on ctl assets and gain on early extinguishment of debt  for the year ended december  net fair value of financial instruments is calculated as the sum of the value of derivative instruments and interest earning assets  less the value of interest bearing liabilities as of december  for more detail on how the fair values of financial instruments were determined  see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
the base interest rate scenario assumes the one month libor rate of as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
net fair value of financial instruments in the table below does not include ctl assets approximately of total assets and certain forms of corporate finance investments but includes debt associated with the financing of these assets 
therefore  the table below is not a meaningful representation of the estimated percentage change in net fair value of total assets with changes in interest rates 
the estimated percentage change in net investment income does include operating lease income from ctl assets and therefore is a more accurate representation of the impact of changes in interest rates on net investment income 
estimated percentage change in change in interest rates net investment income net fair value of financial instruments basis points base interest rate basis points basis points explanatory notes we have a net floating rate debt exposure resulting in an increase in net investment income when rates decrease and vice versa 
in addition  interest rate floors on our assets further increase net investment income as rates decrease 
as of december   billion of our floating rate loans have a weighted average floor of 
the estimated net fair value of financial instruments under the base interest rate was billion 
a and basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the estimated net fair values of the financial instruments to billion and billion  respectively 
a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the estimated net fair values of the financial instruments to billion  respectively
