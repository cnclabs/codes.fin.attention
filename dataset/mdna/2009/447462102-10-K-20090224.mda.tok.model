item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview  in connection with our acquisition of stockamp and the amendment to the wellspring stock purchase agreement  we issued a total of  shares of our common stock to the sellers of stockamp and wellspring 
additionally  we provided them with a protection against a decline in the value of the shares issued until the restrictions on the shares have lapsed 
as such  we are subject to market risk relating to our common stock 
upon the lapse of the restrictions  if the average daily closing price of our common stock for the ten consecutive trading days prior to the date that the restrictions lapse is or below  then for every that our stock price is below  we would be required to pay the sellers approximately million  in the form of cash  stock  or any combination of cash and stock 
of the  shares issued  the restrictions on  shares lapsed on january  and we were not required to make further payments 
the restrictions on the remaining  shares will lapse on july  based on the average daily closing price of our common stock for the ten consecutive trading days prior to and including december   or  we would not be obligated to make any protection payments to the sellers 
if the average price decreased by to  we would still not be obligated to make any protection payments to the sellers 
from time to time  we invest excess cash in marketable securities 
these investments principally consist of overnight sweep accounts 
due to the short maturity of our investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure
