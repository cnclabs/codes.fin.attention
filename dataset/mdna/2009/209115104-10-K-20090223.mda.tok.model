con edison s principal business segments are con edison of new york s regulated electric  gas and steam utility activities  o r s regulated electric and gas utility activities and con edison s competitive energy businesses 
con edison of new york s principal business segments are its regulated electric  gas and steam utility activities 
for segment financial information  see note n to the financial statements and results of operations  below 
for information about factors that could have a material adverse effect on the companies  see risk factors  below 
regulated utilities con edison of new york provides electric service to approximately million customers and gas service to approximately million customers in new york city and westchester county 
the company also provides steam service in parts of manhattan 
o r  along with its regulated utility businesses  provides electric service to approximately million customers in southeastern new york and adjacent areas of northern new jersey and eastern pennsylvania and gas service to over million customers in southeastern new york and adjacent areas of eastern pennsylvania 
the utilities are primarily wires and pipes energy delivery businesses that deliver energy in their service areas subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the utilities customers buy this energy from the utilities  or from other suppliers through the utilities retail access programs 
the utilities purchase substantially all of the energy they sell to customers pursuant to firm contracts or through wholesale energy markets  and recover generally on a current basis the cost of the energy sold  pursuant to approved rate plans 
con edison anticipates that the utilities will continue to provide substantially all of its earnings over the next few years 
the utilities earnings will depend on various factors including demand for utility service and the utilities ability to charge rates for their services that reflect the costs of service  including a return on invested equity capital 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued because the energy delivery infrastructure must be adequate to meet demand in peak periods with a high level of reliability  the utilities capital investment plans reflect in great part past actual electric peak demand adjusted to summer design weather conditions  as well as forecast growth in peak usage 
the factors affecting demand for utility service include growth of customer demand  weather  market prices for energy  economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency 
demand for electric service peaks during the summer air conditioning season 
demand for gas and steam service peaks during the winter heating season 
the weather during the summer of was cooler than design conditions 
the highest peak electric demand reached in was  mw for con edison of new york and  mw for o r 
both peaks occurred on june  the companies have continued to monitor the effects of the ongoing global financial turmoil on the local economy and have reduced their outlook for customer demand 
the utilities currently estimate that  under design weather conditions  the peak electric demand in their respective service areas will be  mw for con edison of new york and  mw for o r 
the average annual growth rate of the peak electric demand over the next five years at design conditions is estimated to be approximately percent for con edison of new york and percent for o r 
the con edison of new york forecasted peak demand includes the impact of permanent demand reduction programs 
the companies anticipate an ongoing need for substantial capital investment in order to meet this growth in peak usage with the high level of reliability that they currently provide see liquidity and capital resources capital requirements  below 
the utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the rates they can charge their customers 
con edison of new york s electric  gas and steam rate plans are effective through march   september  and september   respectively 
in may  con edison of new york filed a request for a new electric rate plan 
o r s rate plans for its electric and gas service in new york and its subsidiary s electric service in new jersey extend through june   october  and march   respectively 
pursuant to the utilities multi year rate plans  charges to customers generally may not be changed during the respective terms of the rate plans other than for recovery of the costs incurred for energy supply  for specified increases provided in the rate plans and for limited other exceptions 
the new york rate plans for con edison of new york s gas and steam operations as well as o r s electric and gas operations generally require the utilities to share with customers earnings in excess of specified rates of return on common equity capital 
under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in con edison of new york s current electric and gas rate plans and o r s electric rate plan  the utilities revenues will generally not be affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved

competitive energy businesses con edison s competitive energy businesses participate in segments of the electricity industry that are less comprehensively regulated than the utilities 
these segments include the sales and related hedging of electricity to wholesale and retail customers and sales of certain energy related products and services 
at december   con edison s equity investment in its competitive energy businesses was million and their assets amounted to million 
con edison is evaluating additional opportunities to invest in electric and gas related businesses 
consolidated edison solutions  inc con edison solutions sells electricity directly to delivery service customers of utilities primarily in the northeast and mid atlantic regions including some of the utilities customers and also offers energy related services 
con edison solutions does not sell electricity to the utilities 
the company sold approximately million mwhs of electricity to customers in consolidated edison development  inc con edison development participates in infrastructure projects

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued risk factors the companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict  and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
these risk factors include the utilities revenues and results of operations reflect regulatory actions the utilities have rate plans approved by state utility regulators that cover the prices they can charge their customers 
the prices are generally designed to cover the utilities cost of service including a return on equity and generally may not be changed during the specified terms of the rate plans other than for the recovery of energy costs and limited other exceptions 
the rate plans generally include earnings adjustments for meeting or failing to meet certain standards 
certain of the plans require action by regulators at their expiration dates  which may include approval of new plans with different provisions 
regulators may also take actions affecting the company outside of the framework of the approved rate plans 
the regulators in the states in which the utilities provide service generally permit the utilities to recover from their customers the cost of service  other than any cost that is determined to have been imprudently incurred 
regulatory policies are subject to change 
the utilities regulatory filings can involve complex accounting and other calculations 
see application of critical accounting polices and regulatory matters  below 
con edison s ability to pay dividends or interest is subject to regulatory restrictions con edison s ability to pay dividends on its common stock or interest on its external borrowings depends primarily on the dividends and other distributions it receives from its businesses 
the dividends that the utilities may pay to con edison are generally limited to not more than percent of their respective income available for dividends calculated on a two year rolling average basis  with certain exceptions 
see dividends in note c to the financial statements 
the companies purchase energy for their customers a disruption in the wholesale energy markets or in the companies energy supply arrangements could adversely affect their ability to meet their customers energy needs and the companies results of operations 
the companies have policies to manage the economic risks related to energy supply  including related hedging transactions and the risk of a counterparty s non performance 
the utilities generally recover their prudently incurred fuel  purchased power and gas costs  including the cost of hedging transactions  in accordance with rate provisions approved by state regulators 
con edison s competitive energy businesses enter into hedging transactions to manage their commodity related price and volumetric risks 
see financial and commodity market risks  below 
energy market prices are volatile the impact of changing energy market prices on the companies is mitigated by their energy management policies and rate provisions pursuant to which the utilities recover energy supply costs 
see financial and commodity market risks  below 
high energy market prices result in increases in energy costs billed to customers that could result in decreased energy usage 
if this were to occur  until rates for con edison of new york s steam business  o r s electric businesses in new jersey and pennsylvania and o r s gas business were adjusted to offset the effect of decreased usage  the utilities would have decreased energy delivery revenues 
under the revenue decoupling mechanisms currently applicable to con edison of new york s electric and gas businesses and o r s electric business in new york  the utilities revenues will generally not be affected by changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved 
see note b to the financial statements 
prices for electricity  fuel oil and gas could also affect the value of con edison s competitive energy businesses 
the utilities have a substantial ongoing utility construction program the utilities estimate that their construction expenditures will exceed billion over the next three years 
the ongoing construction program includes large energy transmission  substation and distribution system projects 
the failure to complete these projects in a timely manner could adversely affect the utilities ability to meet their customers growing energy needs with the high level of reliability that they currently provide 
a substantial portion of the construction program is undertaken through contractors 
see investigation of contractor payments in note h to the financial statements 
the utilities expect to use internally generated funds  equity contributions from con edison and external borrowings to fund the construction expenditures 
the companies are active participants in financial markets changes in financial market conditions or in the companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability and their cost to borrow funds 
the companies commercial paper and unsecured debt are rated by moody s investors services  inc moody s  standard poor s ratings services s p and fitch ratings fitch 
the interest rates on million of con edison of new york tax exempt debt and million of o r tax exempt debt are also affected by the credit ratings of bond insurers

changes to financial market conditions could also adversely affect the return on investment of the plan assets for the companies pension and other postretirement benefit plans  and in did materially adversely affect the value of the plan assets 
see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits and financial and commodity market risks  below and notes e and f to the financial statements 
the companies operate essential energy facilities and other systems the utilities provide electricity  gas and steam service using energy facilities that are located either in  or close to  public places 
a failure of  or damage to  these facilities could result in bodily injury or death  property damage  the release of hazardous substances or extended service interruptions 
see manhattan steam main rupture in note h to the financial statements 
the companies have energy facilities  information systems and business processes relating to their operations  billing  accounting and other matters  the failure of which could adversely affect the companies operations and liquidity and result in substantial liability  higher costs and increased regulatory requirements 
the companies have training  operating  security  maintenance and capital programs designed to provide for the safe and reliable operation of their energy facilities  information systems and business processes 
con edison s competitive energy businesses are in evolving markets con edison s competitive energy businesses are active in evolving markets that are affected by the actions of governmental agencies  other organizations such as independent system operators and other competitive businesses 
compared to the utilities  the profitability of their products and services and the recoverability of con edison s investment in these competitive energy businesses is not as predictable 
the companies may be affected by the application of critical accounting policies and rules the application of the companies critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
these policies  which are described in application of critical accounting policies below  include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities  the accounting and funding rules applicable to pensions and other postretirement benefits  and accounting for contingencies  long lived assets  derivative instruments  goodwill and leases 
new accounting policies or rules or changes to current accounting policies  rules or interpretations of such policies or rules that affect the companies financial statements may be adopted by the relevant accounting or other authorities 
the companies are exposed to risks relating to environmental matters hazardous substances  such as asbestos  polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and coal tar  have been used or produced in the course of the utilities operations and are present on properties or in facilities and equipment currently or previously owned by them 
see environmental matters in item and note g to the financial statements 
electric and magnetic fields emf are found wherever electricity is used 
if a causal relationship between emf and adverse health effects were established  there could be a material adverse effect on the companies 
negative perceptions about emf can make it more difficult to construct facilities needed for the companies operations 
the companies are subject to extensive government regulation and taxation the companies operations require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
the companies federal income tax returns reflect certain tax positions with which the internal revenue service does not or may not agree  including tax positions with respect to con edison s lease in lease out transactions and the deduction of certain construction related costs for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility 
see notes j and l to the financial statements 
the companies may be subject to new laws or regulations or the revision or reinterpretation of existing laws or regulations which could have a material adverse effect on the companies 
the companies face risks that are beyond their control the companies results of operations can be affected by circumstances or events that are beyond their control 
weather directly influences the demand for electricity  gas and steam service  and can affect the price of energy commodities 
economic conditions can affect customers demand and ability to pay for service 
the cost of repairing damage to the companies facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to heat  storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts  pandemic illnesses and other catastrophic events could be substantial 
see environmental matters climate change in item the occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war could also adversely affect the new york or united states economy 
a lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption  which could adversely affect the companies revenues and earnings and limit the companies future growth prospects

the ongoing turmoil could also reduce customer demand for the services provided by the companies and the ability of the companies customers  lenders and other counterparties to meet their obligations to the companies 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbor provisions of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements are statements of future expectation and not facts 
words such as expects  estimates  anticipates  intends  believes  plans  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made  and accordingly speak only as of that time 
actual results or developments might differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements because of various factors such as those discussed under risk factors  above 
application of critical accounting policies the companies financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies  which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the companies critical accounting policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies  long lived assets  derivative instruments  goodwill and leases 
accounting for regulated public utilities the utilities are subject to sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and the accounting requirements of the federal energy regulatory commission and state public utility regulatory authorities having jurisdiction 
sfas no 
specifies the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise 
revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred 
if regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future  these costs would be recorded as deferred charges or regulatory assets under sfas no 
if revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future  these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits or regulatory liabilities under sfas no 
the utilities principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in note b to the financial statements 
the utilities are each receiving or being credited with a return on all regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made 
the utilities are each paying or being charged with a return on all regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received 
the regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered from customers  or applied for customer benefit  in accordance with rate provisions approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission 
in the event that regulatory assets of the utilities were no longer probable of recovery as required by sfas no 
 these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings 
at december   the regulatory assets for con edison and con edison of new york were billion and billion  respectively 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits the utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees 
con edison s competitive energy businesses also provide such benefits to certain of their employees 
the companies account for these benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in addition  the utilities apply sfas no 
to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations which  as described in note b to the financial statements  reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred 
in applying these accounting policies  the companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions  including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets  discount rates  health care cost trends and future compensation 
see notes e and f to the financial statements for information about the companies pension and other postretirement benefits  the actuarial assumptions  actual performance  amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for  and the cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets  assumptions for future periods  contributions and benefit experience

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued estimates for are increases  compared with  in their pension and other postretirement benefits cost of million and million  respectively 
the discount rate used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit accounting cost is percent and the expected return on plan assets tax exempt assets for postretirement benefit accounting costs is percent 
amortization of market gains and losses experienced in previous years is expected to increase con edison s and con edison of new york s pension and other postretirement benefit costs by an additional million and million  respectively  in a percentage point variation in the actual annual return in  as compared with the expected annual asset return of percent  would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for both con edison and con edison of new york by approximately million and million  respectively  in the discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly rated aa and aaa  by moody s corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments 
in determining the health care cost trend rate  the companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends

pension accounting by the utilities includes an allocation of plan assets 
the companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in under funding regulations and tax laws 
however  con edison of new york  o r and con edison s competitive energy businesses made discretionary contributions to the plan in of million  million and million  respectively  and expect to make discretionary contributions in for con edison of new york and o r of million and million  respectively 
the companies policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible and for the utilities  to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate agreements 
see expected contributions in notes e and f to the financial statements 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  applies to an existing condition  situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
known material contingencies  which are described in the notes to the financial statements  include the utilities responsibility for hazardous substances  such as asbestos  pcbs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations note g  certain tax matters notes j and l  and other contingencies note h 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued the utilities generally recover costs for asbestos lawsuits  workers compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans 
changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings 
accounting for long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
under sfas no 
 an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows  and exceeds its fair value  which approximates market value 
accounting for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  con edison is required to annually test goodwill for impairment 
see note k to the financial statements 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step requires a calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill was million at december  the most recent test  which was performed during the fourth quarter of  did not require any second step assessment and did not result in any impairment 
the company s most significant assumptions surrounding the goodwill impairment test relate to the estimates of reporting unit fair values 
the company estimated fair values based primarily on discounted cash flows and on market values for a proxy group of companies 
accounting for derivative instruments the companies apply sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and other related accounting pronouncements to their derivative financial instruments 
the companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas and interest rate risk on certain debt securities 
the utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments 
see financial and commodity market risks  below and note o to the financial statements 
where the companies are required to make mark to market estimates pursuant to sfas no 
 the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions  and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction 
substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources 
accounting for leases the companies apply sfas no 
 accounting for leases and other related pronouncements to their leasing transactions 
see note j to the financial statements for information about con edison development s lease in lease out or lilo transactions  a disallowance of tax losses by the internal revenue service and a possible future charge to earnings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 con edison accounted for the two lilo transactions as leveraged leases 
accordingly  the company s investment in these leases  net of non recourse debt  is carried as a single amount in con edison s consolidated balance sheet and income is recognized pursuant to a method that incorporates a level rate of return for those years when net investment in the lease is positive  based upon the after tax cash flows projected at the inception of the leveraged leases 
liquidity and capital resources the companies liquidity reflects cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as shown on their respective consolidated statement of cash flows and as discussed below 
the principal factors affecting con edison s liquidity are its investments in the utilities  the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below 
the principal factors affecting con edison of new york s liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities  cash used in investing activities including construction expenditures  the dividends it pays to con edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below

variance vs 
operating activities investing activities financing activities net change balance at beginning of period balance at end of period cash flows from operating activities the utilities cash flows from operating activities reflect principally their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations 
the volume of energy sales and deliveries is dependent primarily on factors external to the utilities  such as growth of customer demand  weather  market prices for energy  economic conditions and measures that promote energy efficiency 
the prices at which the utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate agreements 
in general  changes in the utilities cost of purchased power  fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows but not net income because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate agreements 
see recoverable energy costs in note a to the financial statements 
net income is the result of cash and non cash or accrual transactions 
only cash transactions affect the companies cash flows from operating activities 
principal non cash charges include depreciation and deferred income tax expense 
principal non cash credits include the revenue requirement impact resulting from the reconciliation pursuant to con edison of new york s electric rate agreement of the differences between the actual amount of transmission and distribution utility plant  net of depreciation to the amounts reflected in electric rates net t d revenues and amortizations of certain net regulatory liabilities 
non cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in con edison of new york s current electric and gas rate plans and o r s electric rate plan 
see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  and notes e and f to the financial statements and see rate agreements con edison of new york electric and o r electric in note b to the financial statements 
net cash flows from operating activities in for con edison and con edison of new york were million and million lower  respectively  than in the period 
the decreases reflect primarily the july prepayment  by con edison of new york  of its annual new york city property taxes in the amount of million 
by prepaying this annual amount as opposed to paying in semi annual installments  con edison of new york received a percent reduction in its new york city property taxes

from time to time certain parties have petitioned the psc to review these provisions  the elimination of which could have a material adverse effect on the companies financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
to reduce the volatility of electric energy costs  the utilities have firm contracts to purchase electric energy and enter into derivative transactions to hedge the costs of a portion of their expected purchases under these contracts and through the nyiso s wholesale electricity market  which together cover a substantial portion of the electric energy expected to be sold to customers in see notes i and o to the financial statements

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued financial and commodity market risks the companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets 
the most significant market risks include interest rate risk  commodity price risk  credit risk and investment risk 
interest rate risk the interest rate risk relates primarily to variable rate debt and to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including the construction expenditures of the utilities and maturing debt securities 
con edison and its businesses manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt 
the companies estimate that at december   each percent variation in interest rates applicable to con edison s and con edison of new york s variable rate debt and commercial paper would result in a change in annual interest expense of million and million  respectively 
in addition  from time to time  con edison and its businesses enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk on certain debt securities 
see interest rate swaps in note o to the financial statements 
commodity price risk con edison s commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity  gas and related derivative instruments 
the utilities and con edison s competitive energy businesses have risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures 
see note o to the financial statements 
con edison estimates that  as of december   a percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of million for the derivative instruments used by the utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas  of which million is for con edison of new york and million is for o r 
con edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased 
in accordance with provisions approved by state regulators  the utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers  including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs 
see recoverable energy costs in note a to the financial statements 
con edison s competitive energy businesses use a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of their electricity and gas commodity fixed price purchase and sales commitments  physical forward contracts and commodity derivative instruments 
var represents the potential change in fair value of instruments or the portfolio due to changes in market factors  for a specified time period and confidence level 
these businesses estimate var across their electricity and natural gas commodity businesses using a delta normal variance covariance model with a percent confidence level 
since the var calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience  it is not necessarily indicative of future results 
var for transactions associated with hedges on generating assets and commodity contracts  assuming a one day holding period  for the years ended december   and  respectively  was as follows confidence level  one day holding period millions of dollars average for the period high low credit risk the companies are exposed to credit risk related to transactions entered into primarily for the various energy supply and hedging activities by the utilities and the competitive energy businesses 
credit risk relates to the loss that may result from a counterparty s nonperformance 
the companies use credit policies to manage this risk  including an established credit approval process  monitoring of counterparty limits  netting provisions within agreements and collateral or prepayment arrangements  credit insurance and credit default swaps 
the companies measure credit risk exposure as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses where the company has a legally enforceable right of setoff 
con edison of new york had million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities  net of collateral  at december  the entire amount was with commodity exchange brokers 
con edison s competitive energy businesses had million of credit exposure in connection with energy supply and hedging activities  net of collateral  at december   of which million was with investment grade counterparties  million was with commodity exchange brokers or independent system operators and million was with non investment grade counterparties 
investment risk the companies investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
see application of critical accounting policies accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits  above 
the companies current investment policy for pension plan assets 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations combined for con edison and con edison of new york continued includes investment targets of percent equities and percent fixed income and other securities 
at december   the pension plan investments consisted of percent equity and percent fixed income and other securities 
in  financial market conditions materially adversely affected the value of the plan assets 
see notes e and f to the financial statements 
environmental matters for information concerning potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and from claims relating to alleged exposure to asbestos  see environmental matters in item and note g to the financial statements 
impact of inflation the companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation 
regulation permits the utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs 
the impact is  however  partially offset by the repayment of the companies long term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed 
also  to the extent the companies prices change by more or less than inflation  the real price of the companies services will increase or decline 
over the past years  for example  the real price of electric service has declined substantially

operations and maintenance expenses were higher in compared with reflecting primarily higher costs  which are generally reflected in rates  such as pension and other post retirement benefits  the support and maintenance of company underground facilities to accommodate municipal projects  the write off of uncollectible accounts and additional operating programs 
depreciation and property taxes were higher in compared with reflecting primarily the impact from increased capital expenditures 
for additional information about major factors affecting earnings  see results of operations summary  above 
in general  the utilities recover on a current basis the fuel  gas purchased for resale and purchased power costs they incur in supplying energy to their full service customers see recoverable energy costs in note a and regulatory matters in note b to the financial statements 
accordingly  such costs do not generally affect the companies results of operations 
management uses the term net revenues operating revenues less such costs to identify changes in operating revenues that may affect the companies results of operations 
management believes that  although net revenues may not be a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the measure facilitates the analysis by management and investors of the companies results of operations
