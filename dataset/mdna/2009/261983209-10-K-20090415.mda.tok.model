management s overview dreams  inc  headquartered in plantation  florida has evolved into the premier vertically integrated licensed sports products firm in the industry 
this has been accomplished  in part  via organic growth and strategic acquisitions 
our continuing pursuit of this dual strategy should result in our becoming a principal leader and a consolidator in this highly fragmented industry 
specifically  we are engaged in multiple aspects of the licensed sports products and autographed memorabilia industry through a variety of distribution channels 
we generate revenues from our seventeen company owned field of dreams stores  our six company owned fansedge stores  our e commerce component featuring www 
fansedge 
com and others  our athlete and web syndication sites  our catalogues  our outbound vip call center  our manufacturing distribution of sports memorabilia products  custom acrylic display cases and framing  our running of sports memorabilia collectible trade shows  our franchise program through the eight field of dreams franchise stores presently operating  and our representation and corporate marketing of individual athletes 
organic growth key components of our organic growth strategy include building brand recognition  improving sales conversion rates both in our stores and web sites  continuing our execution of multi channel retailing  exploring additional distribution channels for our products  and cross pollinating corporate assets among our various operating divisions 
management believes that there remain significant benefits to cross pollinating the various corporate assets and leveraging the vertically integrated model that has been constructed over the years 
in particular  we have had success with the marketing of our products on line via fansedge 
com and the complement of each of our web properties 
the company s sales associated with these e commerce initiatives have grown from million in to nearly million in  placing it at number in  number in and number in of the largest internet retailers in 
table of contents the nation 
internet sales for the twelve months ended december  and december   were million and million  respectively 
the company has drawn on a complete spectrum of competencies it developed to support its flagship online brand  fansedge 
this has allowed the company to leverage the investments made during the past few years by marketing a proven range of services to third parties that include  managed hosting  custom site design and development  customer service  order fulfillment  purchasing  inventory management  marketing  merchandising  and analytics and reporting 
the company calls the compilation of e commerce services described above as  web syndication  and believes there are significant growth opportunities that exist in the marketplace 
commencing in june  we have successfully opened and are presently operating six fansedge stores in the greater chicago  il area 
this is in support of our executing our multi channel retailing strategy  whereby we our driving and marketing a single brand via multiple channels 
we plan to add an e commerce component to our fieldofdreams 
com site to cross market our company owned field of dreams stores in our proprietary e commerce platform has also enabled us to fuel a state of the art in store interactive kiosk for ordering products 
these kiosks are in each of the new fansedge stores and is providing a unique shopping experience for our customers by allowing them to access the entire company portfolio of more than  sku s stock keeping units 
in fact  so far  we are seeing an average of contribution to the individual store sales from the kiosks 
in october  fansedge 
com announced it began offering its vast array of products internationally to countries 
also  our first fansedge catalogue was shipped in november we believe this expansion of our revenue producing foot print will serve us well as we navigate our business models through the challenging economy and look to distinguish ourselves from our competitors 
strategic acquisitions our strategic acquisition initiatives will focus on e commerce companies  brick and mortar retailers  other manufacturers of licensed sports and entertainment products and collectibles 
these are companies that can offer incremental distribution channels for our products and whose value can be enhanced by placing them under the dreams corporate umbrella 
normally  upon successfully completing these types of acquisitions  we seek to retain key management personnel while instituting a growth culture 
hence  our ability to evaluate potential acquisition candidates and consummate these transactions will remain an integral part of our business model in the future 
in august  we acquired the assets of starstruck proteam  a catalogue focused retailer in the sports licensed products industry 
starstruck proteam is one of the largest catalogue and internet retailers of licensed major league and minor league merchandise in the country 
the company also produces the official catalogue for the new york mets 
through the addition of a catalogue business  dreams will further strengthen its multi channel retailing strategy 
objective our overall objective is to establish a market leading totally licensed  sports and entertainment products enterprise and true multi channel retailer 
that is  to service the customer by every possible means necessary in an efficient  profitable  and professional manner  driving and building our brands through on line  brick and mortar  catalogue  kiosk  and in bound and out bound call centers 
analysis we review our operations based on both our financial results and various non financial measures 
management s focus in reviewing performance begins with growth in sales  margin integrity and operating income 
on the expense side  with a majority of our sales being achieved as an on line retailer of licensed sports products  we spend a disproportionate amount of our operating expenses in internet marketing 
therefore  we continuously monitor the return on investment of these particular expenses 
we believe the implementation of our multi channel retailing strategy will strengthen our brands in the marketplace 
we believe we are well positioned to capture increased activity of on line retail purchases as industry experts and analysts state that currently  only of all retail sales are being conducted on line and that over the next few years  consumers may generate twice that figure in on line purchases 
also  with the continued growth of our web syndication business model  we are leveraging the company s investment in its broad inventory by offering the items to multiple sites simultaneously 
this should improve our inventory turns  increase our absorption rates and reduce inventory carrying costs 
some of the important non financial measures which management reviews are unique visitors to our web sites  foot traffic in our stores  sales conversion rates and average sold unit prices 

table of contents historically  the fourth quarter of the fiscal year october to december has accounted for a greater proportion of our operating income than have each of the other three quarters of our fiscal year 
this is primarily due to increased activities as a result of the holiday season 
we expect that we will continue to experience quarterly variations and operating results principally as a result of the seasonal nature of our industry 
other factors also make for a significant fluctuation of our quarterly results  including the timing of special events  the general popularity of a specific team that wins a championship or an individual athlete who enters their respective sports hall of fame  the amount and timing of new sales contributed by new stores  the timing of personal appearances by particular athletes and general economic conditions 
additional factors may cause fluctuations and expenses  including the costs associated with the opening of new stores  the integration of acquired businesses and stores into our operations  the over all strength of the economy  and corporate expenses to support our expansion and growth strategy 
conclusion we set ourselves apart from other companies with our diversified product and services line  our proprietary e commerce platform  as well as our relationships with sports leagues  agents and athletes 
management believes we can continue to capture market share and become a consolidator in the highly fragmented licensed sports products industry 
during the slowing economy  we have been proactive as it relates to our corporate over head and expenses and have instituted several savings initiatives including  lay offs  management and employee salary reductions  re negotiations of our client contracts  rent economics  extended terms from key suppliers  etc 
general as used in this form k we  our  us  the company and dreams refer to dreams  inc and its subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accounting principles accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity collectibility of accounts receivable the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its obligations to the company  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon the company s operations 
the company s current allowance for doubtful accounts is december  december  accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net reserves on inventories the company establishes a reserve based on historical experience and specific reserves when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
a charge to operations results when the estimated net realizable value of inventory items declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value 
the company s current reserve for inventory obsolescence is income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing the company s provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates quarterly its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance  if necessary 
the company provides a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets when it believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
the company has prepared an analysis based upon historical data and forecasted earnings projections to determine its ability to realize its net deferred tax asset 
after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and 
table of contents negative  management has determined that a valuation allowance of as of december  and as of december   was necessary 
goodwill and unamortized intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill as of december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair value 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value 
the company s evaluations of the carrying amount of goodwill were completed as of december  and december   in accordance with sfas  resulted in no impairment losses 
there were no material changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended december  revenue recognition the company recognizes retail including e commerce sales and wholesale distribution revenues at the later of a the time of shipment or b when title passes to the customers  all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
retail revenues and wholesale distribution are recognized at the time of sale 
return allowances  which reduce gross sales  are estimated using historical experience 
revenues from the sale of franchises are deferred until the company fulfills its obligations under the franchise agreement and the franchised unit opens 
the franchise agreements provide for continuing royalty fees based on a percentage of gross receipts 
management fee revenue related to the representation and marketing of professional athletes is recognized when earned and is reflected net of its related costs of sales 
the majority of the revenue generated from the representation and marketing of professional athletes relates to services as an agent 
in these arrangements  the company is not the primary obligor in these transactions but rather only receives a net agent fee 
revenues from industry trade shows are recognized at the time of the show when tickets are submitted for autographs or actual product purchases take place 
in instances when the company receives pre payments for show autographs  the company records these amounts as deferred revenue until the products are signed and shipped delivered to the customer  at which time the revenue is recognized 
the company partnered in a corporate rebate program with a national consumer goods retailer 
the company issued rebate coupons for which it was pre paid of the coupon value 
certificates redeemed through december   were recognized as revenue in the current period 
additionally  a breakage model was projected for the program s eight month term  based upon redemption totals through march  thus  the company recognized four months of breakage revenue for the year ended december  the company had approximately in orders not yet shipped as of december

after consideration of all of the evidence  management has determined that a valuation allowance of is necessary for the twelve months ended december   and for the twelve months ended december  the company expects its continuing effective tax rate to approximate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity during the twelve months period ended december   are the cash flows generated from our operating subsidiaries  availability under our million senior revolving credit facility  availability under our million acquisition line and available cash and cash equivalents 
we are unaware of any trends that may have a negative impact on our ability to continue our operations 
the balance sheet as of december  reflects working capital of million versus working capital of million at december  at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents were thousand compared to million at december  please note that the company is not negatively impacted by the cash balance of thousand as it has sufficient access to capital under its revolving credit facility with its senior lender 
as a lead in to the holiday season  the company draws down on its line of credit to make inventory purchases so it is properly positioned to support the increased sales activity experienced during the quarter ended december  the increased throughput results in significant pay downs to the line balances  and the yearly cycle starts anew 
net accounts receivable at december  were million compared to million at december  use of funds cash used in operations amounted to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million used in operations during the same period of the increase is a result of paying off million of trade payables expand

the loan is collateralized by all of the assets of the company and its divisions 
the interest rate for the revolver is floating at prime or day comerica costs of funds plus  and prime or day comerica costs of funds plus  for the funds drawn from the acquisition line 
as of december   the company s outstanding loan balance was million  yielding million available on the revolver and million  yielding 
million available on the acquisition line 
our line of credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial covenants 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with its covenants and has sought the appropriate waivers from its senior lender 
no assurances can be made that the company will ultimately receive the formal waivers  and if so  under acceptable terms and conditions 
analysis we are continuing to review our operational expenses and examining ways to reduce costs on a going forward basis 
with the slowing economy  we are managing our capital conservatively and analyzing each of our commitments to identify areas where we can improve the profitability and or cash flow of our business 
to date  we have been successful with restructuring many of our rent commitments  player contracts and vendor pricing 
also  we have reduced our workforce and implemented management and employee salary reductions to lower our operating expenses 
in addition  our stock has been  and continues to be  thinly traded despite our listing on the american stock exchange  and our public and investor relations initiatives  therefore providing little liquidity for many of our shareholders 
accordingly  we believe we may have been unable to realize many of the principal benefits of being a public company  all the while  continuing to incur many of the additional costs associated with being a public company  including  but not limited to  listing fees  sec filings  enhanced legal and accounting fees and sarbanes oxley 
we expect that these and other compliance costs of a public company will continue to increase 
as a result of the foregoing  we expect to consider from time to time  strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value  including terminating our status as a public company  going private  and delisting our common stock from the american stock exchange 
contractual obligations in thousands total less than yr yrs yrs more than yrs long term debts capital finance leases operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities does not include interest payable summary management believes that future funds generated from our operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  working capital requirements and our budgeted capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future

the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks  which we use in the normal course of our business operations 
interest rate risk 
we have interest rate risk  in that borrowings under our credit facility with comerica bank are based on variable market interest rates 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility with comerica bank 
presently  the revolving credit line bears interest at the prime rate or 
a hypothetically increase in our credit facility s weighted average interest rate of per annum for the year ended december  would correspondingly decrease our pre tax earnings and our operating cash flows by approximately intangible asset risk 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material changes that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
although at december  we believed our intangible assets were recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
