item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes to consolidated financial statements  which begin on page f of this report 
thermo electron corporation and fisher scientific international inc completed a merger of the two companies on november  in a tax free  stock for stock exchange 
the fisher businesses are a leading provider of products and services to the scientific research community and clinical laboratories 
the fisher businesses provide a suite of products and services to customers worldwide from biochemicals  cell culture media and proprietary rnai technology to rapid diagnostic tests  safety products and other consumable supplies 
fisher had revenues of billion in fisher s results are included in the accompanying financial statements from november  following the merger  the company was renamed thermo fisher scientific inc to assist in year over year comparisons  certain information in the following discussion of the company s results of operations has been presented on a pro forma basis  as if the two companies had been combined from the beginning of overview of results of operations and liquidity the company develops  manufactures and sells a broad range of products that are sold worldwide 
the company expands the product lines and services it offers by developing and commercializing its own core technologies and by making strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses 
following the merger with fisher  the company s continuing operations fall into two principal business segments analytical technologies and laboratory products and services 
during the first quarter of  the company transferred management responsibility and related financial reporting and monitoring for several small product lines between segments 
the company has historically moved a product line between segments when a shift in strategic focus of either the product line or a segment more closely aligns the product line with a segment different than that in which it had previously been reported 
prior period segment information has been reclassified to reflect these transfers 
revenues in the fourth quarter are historically stronger than in other quarters due to capital spending patterns of industrial  pharmaceutical and government customers 
dollars in millions revenues analytical technologies laboratory products and services eliminations sales in were billion  an increase of million from aside from the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and currency translation discussed in total and by segment below  revenues increased over revenues by million due to higher revenues at existing businesses as a result of increased demand  discussed below  and  to a lesser extent  price increases 
the company s strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions such as those completed in the past two years 
the principal acquisitions included la pha pack  a manufacturer and provider of chromatography consumables and related accessories in december  priority solutions international  a third party logistics provider to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries in october  nanodrop technologies  inc  a supplier of micro uv vis spectrophotometry and fluorescence scientific instruments in october and qualigens fine chemicals  an india based chemical manufacturer and supplier in september

table of contents in  operating income and operating income margin were billion and  respectively  compared with million and  respectively  in the increase in operating income was due to higher profitability at existing businesses resulting from incremental revenues including price increases  merger integration savings and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions 
the increase also resulted from million of lower cost of revenues charges  primarily merger related  and from million of lower restructuring and other costs in  principally due to a curtailment gain in associated with a pension plan in the us these increases were offset in part by a million increase in amortization expense as a result of acquisition related intangible assets from and acquisitions 
the company s effective tax rate was and in and  respectively 
the tax provision in was favorably affected by million or percentage points resulting from the impact on deferred tax balances of a change in the apportionment of state tax rates and newly enacted reductions in tax rates in switzerland 
aside from the impact of these items  the tax rate was unfavorably affected by an increase in income in higher tax jurisdictions 
the tax provision in was favorably affected by million or percentage points resulting from enacted reductions in tax rates in the united kingdom  denmark  canada and germany on the company s deferred tax balances 
income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the items discussed above that increased operating income in offset in part by the higher tax rate in during  the company s cash flow from operations totaled billion  compared with billion for the decrease resulted from higher payments for income taxes and an increased investment in working capital items offset in part by improved cash flow at existing businesses 
cash flow from operations in was net of million in merger related operating cash outflows  including severance and retirement benefits as well as transaction costs incurred by fisher that were paid subsequent to as of december   the company s outstanding debt totaled billion  of which approximately million is convertible debt  at conversion prices ranging from to per share 
as of february   million of the convertible debt was currently convertible 
although the company s experience is that convertible debentures are not normally converted by investors until close to their maturity date  it is possible  particularly in the current uncertain financial climate  that debentures could be converted prior to their maturity date if  for example  a holder perceives the market for the debentures to be weaker than the market for the common stock 
upon an investor s election to convert  the company is required to pay the original principal portion of these debentures in cash  and the balance of the conversion value in either cash or stock  at the company s election 
should holders elect to convert or exercise their put rights  the company intends to draw on its revolving credit facility to fund substantially all of these principal payments 
the facility is an unsecured revolving credit agreement expiring in with available capacity of million at december  the company believes that its existing cash and short term investments of billion as of december   and the company s future cash flow from operations together with available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit agreement  are sufficient to meet the cash requirements of its businesses for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to equity investments  bad debts  sales returns  inventories  business combinations  intangible assets  warranty obligations  
financial statement index 
table of contents income taxes  pension costs  contingencies and litigation  stock based compensation  restructuring and sale of businesses 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements a accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due 
such allowances totaled million at december  the company estimates the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable  the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
b inventories the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence for differences between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding months  expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional writedowns may be required 
c intangible assets and goodwill the company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company s acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets that require the use of significant judgment in determining i fair value  and ii whether such intangibles are amortizable or non amortizable and  if the former  the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized 
the company estimates the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
amortizable intangible assets totaled billion at december  the company reviews other intangible assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
actual cash flows arising from a particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flows which could imply different carrying values from those established at the dates of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset 
the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and when events occur or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount 
events or circumstances that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities  loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets totaled billion and billion  respectively  at december  estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in the company s analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and the company s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 

financial statement index 
table of contents the company s market capitalization decreased from september to approximately book value in the three business days before and after year end 
management believes that the decrease occurred primarily due to economic uncertainty affecting the broader financial markets and concern about companies ability to reach their financial goals 
the company s businesses  however  were not materially adversely affected by the significant global downturn during projections of profitability for and thereafter and indicated fair values based on peer revenues and earnings trading multiples were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets existed at december  there can be no assurance  however  that further deterioration of the financial markets will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiples and the company s businesses such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these assets become impaired 
should the fair value of the company s goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment may be necessary 
d other long lived assets the company reviews other long lived assets for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
other long lived assets totaled billion at december   including billion of fixed assets 
in testing a long lived asset for impairment  assumptions are made concerning projected cash flows associated with the asset 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth and asset related expenditures associated with the asset being reviewed for impairment 
should future cash flows decline significantly from estimated amounts  charges for impairment of other long lived assets may be necessary 
e revenues in instances where the company sells equipment with a related installation obligation  the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title passes 
the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation 
the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on relative fair value at the time of sale 
should the fair value of either the equipment or the installation change  the company s revenue recognition would be affected 
if fair value is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed 
in instances where the company sells equipment with customer specified acceptance criteria  the company must assess whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criteria prior to the customer s acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition 
if the nature of customer specified acceptance criteria were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence  the company would be required to defer additional revenues upon shipment of its products until completion of customer acceptance testing 
the company s software license agreements generally include multiple products and services  or elements 
the company recognizes software license revenue based on the residual method after all elements have either been delivered or vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered elements 
in the event vsoe is not available for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery is completed 
revenues from software maintenance and support contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
vsoe of fair value of software maintenance and support is determined based on the price charged for the maintenance and support when sold separately 
revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are performed  based on vsoe  which is determined by reference to the price customers pay when the services are sold separately 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns by customers 
should a greater or lesser number of products be returned  additional adjustments to revenue may be required 

financial statement index 
table of contents f warranty obligations at the time the company recognizes revenue  it provides for the estimated cost of product warranties based primarily on historical experience and knowledge of any specific warranty problems that indicate projected warranty costs may vary from historical patterns 
the liability for warranty obligations of the company s continuing operations totaled million at december  should product failure rates or the actual cost of correcting product failures vary from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be necessary 
g income taxes in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions 
the company assesses income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
where applicable  associated interest expense has also been recognized 
the company operates in numerous countries under many legal forms and  as a result  is subject to the jurisdiction of numerous domestic and non us tax authorities  as well as to tax agreements and treaties among these governments 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events  such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements and treaties  currency exchange restrictions or the company s level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of current and deferred tax balances and hence the company s net income 
the company estimates the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provides a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that it believes will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  the company reverses the related valuation allowance 
following the adoption of sfas no 
r in  any such reversals will be recorded as a reduction of the company s tax provision 
the company s tax valuation allowance totaled million at december  should the company s actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from estimates  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
the company provides a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
accrued income taxes totaled million at december  should tax return positions that the company expects are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  the company could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits ultimately be sustained  a reduction in the company s tax provision would result 
h contingencies and litigation the company records accruals for various contingencies  including legal proceedings  environmental  workers compensation  product  general and auto liabilities  and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
the accruals are based on management s judgment  historical claims experience  the probability of losses and  where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates 
reserves of fisher as of the merger date  including environmental reserves  were initially recorded at their fair value and as such were discounted to their net present value 
additionally  the company records receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

financial statement index 
table of contents i pension and other retiree benefits several of the company s us and us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans 
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
net periodic pension costs for the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans totaled income of million in  including million of income from curtailment of pension plans 
the company s unfunded benefit obligation totaled million at year end compared with million at year end should any of these assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate would result in an annual increase in pension and other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million and an increase in the benefit obligation of approximately million 
the decrease in the funded status in resulted primarily from a downturn that affected financial markets 
the company expects to contribute to million to its defined benefit pension plans in j stock based compensation the fair value of each stock option granted by the company is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
management estimates expected volatility based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected lives of grants through were estimated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options as permitted by sab thereafter  historical data on exercise patterns became the basis for determining the expected life of an option 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term which approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation 
the compensation expense recognized for all stock based awards is net of estimated forfeitures 
the company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical analysis of option forfeitures 
if actual forfeitures should vary from estimated forfeitures  adjustments to compensation expense may be required 
k restructuring costs the company records restructuring charges for the cost of vacating facilities based on future lease obligations and expected sub rental income 
the company s accrued restructuring costs for abandoned facilities in continuing operations totaled million at december  should actual cash flows associated with sub rental income from vacated facilities vary from estimated amounts  adjustments may be required 

financial statement index 
table of contents l assets held for sale the company estimates the expected proceeds from any assets held for sale and  when necessary  records losses to reduce the carrying value of these assets to estimated realizable value 
should the actual or estimated proceeds  which would include post closing purchase price adjustments  vary from current estimates  results could differ from expected amounts 
results of operations compared with continuing operations sales in were billion  an increase of million from the favorable effects of currency translation resulted in an increase in revenues of million in sales increased million due to acquisitions  net of divestitures 
aside from the effect of currency translation and acquisitions  net of divestitures  revenues increased million primarily due to increased demand and  to a lesser extent  price increases  as described by segment below 
growth was very strong in asia  moderate in north america and modest in europe although in the fourth quarter of  growth slowed in asia and improved in europe 
although the company did not experience a material adverse impact on its revenues or profitability in as a result of the current business environment  no assurances can be given that these poor economic conditions will not continue in or beyond  and cause certain customers to delay or cancel orders for the company s products or services 
in the latter part of  the us dollar strengthened against other major currencies in which the company sells product and services 
strengthening of the dollar had a negative effect on the amount of revenues the company reported in us dollars of approximately in the fourth quarter of were the currency exchange rates in effect in early  to remain during  translation would negatively affect revenues in by approximately 
the lower revenues would unfavorably affect earnings per share by approximately

the increase also resulted from million of lower cost of revenues charges  primarily merger related  and from million of lower restructuring and other costs in  principally due to a curtailment gain in associated with a pension plan in the us these increases were offset in part by a million increase in amortization expense as a result of acquisition related intangible assets from and acquisitions 
restructuring and other costs were recorded during and in  the company recorded restructuring and other costs  net  of million  including million of charges to cost of revenues related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations 
the company incurred million of cash costs primarily for severance to reduce headcount at several businesses in response to economic uncertainty and a decline in financial markets and for abandoned facility expenses at businesses that have been or are being consolidated 
the company also recorded a million charge for the impairment of acquisition related intangible assets associated with a small business unit acquired as part of fisher  a million loss from a litigation related matter assumed as part of the merger with fisher  a million net loss on the sale of businesses and a million charge for in process research and development at an acquired business 
these charges were offset by a million gain on the curtailment of part of a pension plan in the us note

segment results dollars in millions change revenues analytical technologies laboratory products and services eliminations consolidated revenues operating income analytical technologies laboratory products and services subtotal reportable segments cost of revenues charges restructuring and other costs  net amortization of acquisition related intangible assets consolidated operating income the company s management evaluates segment operating performance using operating income before certain charges to cost of revenues  principally associated with acquisition accounting  restructuring and other costs income including costs arising from facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses from the sale of real estate and product lines  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets  and charges for the acceleration of stock based compensation following the merger with fisher 
the company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation note 
income from the company s reportable segments increased to billion in due primarily to higher profitability at existing businesses  resulting from incremental revenues including price increases and productivity improvements including global sourcing and lower operating costs following restructuring actions
