executive overview fiscal was a year of challenges and modest successes for us 
we reached legal settlements with both hawaiian and aloha airlines 
in the hawaiian airlines settlement  we recovered million from a bond being held by the us bankruptcy court in hawaii 
our settlement with aloha resolved litigation and provided both parties the opportunity to benefit through a licensing agreement which allows mesa to operate under the aloha name 
we agreed to pay aloha million cash  issue stock equal to of our current outstanding shares and provide inter island flight benefits to certain former aloha employees 
mesa agreed to the terms of these settlements without admitting any wrongdoing 
also during the fiscal year  we expanded capacity in hawaii  available seat miles increased by over the prior year 
after only months in operation we congratulated our one millionth passenger 
we look forward to the opportunity to grow the hawaiian segment of our operation 
in the first three quarters of the fiscal year we took strides to grow our fuel efficient crj fleet flying for delta as freedom airlines 
we placed seven s into service in the first three quarters with the intent to fulfill a contract with delta to increase the crj fleet to a total of aircraft 
in august  delta notified mesa of the termination of the crj delta connection agreement  citing an alleged failure to meet certain contractual benchmarks contained in the crj delta connection agreement 
mesa denies having violated the delta connection agreement and we intend to challenge delta s decision 
during the third quarter mesa won a preliminary injunction in the federal court in atlanta enjoining delta air lines from terminating freedom airline s erj contract 
this injunction was in response to delta s notification of its intent to terminate the delta connection agreement as a result of freedom s alleged failure to maintain a specified completion rate with respect to its delta connection flights during three months of the six month period ended february in may we sold of our beechcraft d s to raytheon aircraft credit corporation 
the transaction included the elimination of million of long term debt associated with the aircraft and resulted in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million for the company 
air midwest ceased operating in all markets at the end of the third quarter this was consistent with an announcement made in fiscal of the company s intent to do so 
in july we entered into a new time and material maintenance program with ge 
this agreement terminates the terms of a previous contract for the maintenance and repair of mesa s owned or operated cf b engines  settled mesa s prior payment obligations and awarded a new exclusive year contract for the maintenance repair  and overhaul of mesa s cf in accordance with the agreement  mesa entered into a note payable for million in addition to a million payment for past due receivables

as of the end of the fiscal year we had taken delivery of thirteen crj aircraft and five crj aircraft 
the obligation to purchase the remaining two crj s was terminated in june in connection with our agreement to purchase new crj nextgen aircraft 
in conjunction with this purchase agreement  mesa has  on deposit with bombardier that was included in lease and equipment deposits on september  the deposit amount is expected to be returned upon completion of permanent financing on each of the ten aircraft 
on september   the company and bombardier amended the purchase agreement to return million of the million previously held on deposit  delayed deliveries of the crj aircraft and advanced rebates related to bombardier s heavy maintenance service agreement 
in the third quarter of fiscal we entered into a letter of intent to sell our interest in chinese carrier kunpeng airlines to shenzhen airlines  the majority shareholder  for million 
numerous drafts of a proposed agreement were exchanged in the past two quarters 
a valuation of the interest was conducted by both companies  resulting in mesa recording a loss on its investment in kunpeng of million as of the end of the fiscal year 
this loss reflects the expected proceeds from the sale of million less the company s investment of million and estimated transaction costs of  the company will continue to sublease five regional jets to kunpeng 
these leases are not affected by the letter of intent 
total sublease revenue for fiscal was million 
at year end the company had gross receivables from kunpeng of approximately million 
during the third quarter ended june   the company recorded an impairment charge of million on its investment in kunpeng which is classified in loss from equity method investment in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note 
in addition  the company sold of its beechcraft d aircraft 
in connection with these negotiations and in preparation for marketing the remaining beechcraft d aircraft the company concluded that the fair value of the remaining aircraft was less than the carrying value and therefore recorded an impairment charge of million during the second quarter ended march  the impairment charge is included within loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note 
while the airline industry in general  and mesa in particular  face a number of challenges in today s operating environment  we remain resolutely committed to returning the company to sustained profitability and delivering the best service possible to our passengers and airline partners

this compares to consolidated net loss from continuing operations of million or per diluted share in fiscal and consolidated net income from continuing operations of million or 
per diluted share in fiscal approximately of our passenger revenue was associated with revenue guarantee code share agreements 
under the terms of our revenue guarantee agreements  our major carrier partner controls the marketing  scheduling  ticketing  pricing and seat inventories 
our role is simply to operate our fleet in the safest and most reliable manner in exchange for fees paid under a generally fixed payment schedule 
we receive a guaranteed payment based upon a fixed minimum monthly amount plus amounts related to departures and block hours flown in addition to direct reimbursement of expenses such as fuel  landing fees and insurance 
among other advantages  revenue guarantee arrangements reduce our exposure to fluctuations in passenger traffic and fare levels  as well as fuel prices 
in fiscal  approximately of our fuel purchases were reimbursed under revenue guarantee code share agreements 
the remaining passenger revenues are derived from our go operations

operating revenues for go increased million as a result of a increase in average fares and a increase in passengers 
freight and other revenue increased by million primarily due to sublease income from our chinese joint venture 
net operating revenue in the year ended september  was negatively impacted by a million charge for impairment of contract incentives 
operating expenses flight operations in the year ended september   flight operations expense decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  on an asm basis  flight operations expense increased to cents per asm in the year ended september  from cents per asm in the year ended september  due to certain fixed components included within flight operations  the company was not able to reduce expenses at the same rate as asm s decreased  resulting in the inverse relationship between the expense decrease and the increase on a per asm basis 
the decrease is primarily driven by a million decrease in wages and employee related expenses 
additionally  there was a net million decrease in aircraft and aircraft related lease expense due to a decrease in the number of aircraft leased year over year as well as a shift of aircraft types within our fleet 
fuel in the year ended september   fuel expense increased by million or  to million from million for the year ended september  on an asm basis  fuel expense increased to cents per asm in the year ended september  from cents per asm in the year ended september  average fuel cost per gallon increased  to an average of per gallon for the year ended september  from an average of per gallon for the year ended september  the cost per gallon increase resulted in a million unfavorable price variance  of which million related to go 
the unfavorable price variance was partially offset by a decrease in the gallons of fuel purchased in the year ended september   which resulted in a million favorable volume variance 
the volume decrease is primarily due to a direct supply agreement with united airlines at fifteen including large stations 
in the year ended september   approximately of our fuel costs were reimbursed by our code share partners 
in most cases under our code share arrangements  the company is contractually responsible for procuring the fuel necessary to conduct its operations  and fuel costs are then passed through to code share partners via weekly invoicing 
the united code share agreement contains an option that allows united to assume the contractual responsibility for procuring and providing the fuel necessary to operate the flights that mesa operates for united 
united has now exercised this option at fifteen of the stations we operate  and as a result we no longer incur raw fuel expense but do recognize the related fuel pass through revenue for the into plane fees for these fifteen united stations 
maintenance in the year ended september   maintenance expense increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  on an asm basis  maintenance expense increased to cents per asm in the year ended september  from cents per asm in the year ended september  the increase in maintenance is primarily due to a million increase in engine repair cost associated with the termination of power by the hour programs and lease returns 
this increase was partially offset with a decrease in heavy maintenance of million due to a new heavy maintenance contract and cancellation of base maintenance contracts  million decrease in expendable parts  primarily volume driven  million decrease in component repair due to new contracts  and a million decrease in freight due to reduced contract rates and the use of two and three day shipping in place of overnight 
wages  overtime  and wage related expenses decreased million due to a decrease in headcount and tight controls on overtime 
aircraft and traffic servicing in the year ended september   aircraft and traffic servicing expense decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  on an asm basis  aircraft and traffic servicing expense increased to cent per asm in the year ended september  from cents per asm in the year ended september  this decrease is related to an million decrease from our code share operations  offset by an increase of million related to our go operations 
promotion and sales in the year ended september   promotion and sales expense increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  the increase is primarily due to an increase in credit card and booking fees 
this increase was driven by an increase in passengers  due to additional capacity and increased number of passengers 
these expenses relate primarily to our go operations 
we do not pay promotion and sales expenses under our revenue guarantee contracts 
general and administrative in the year ended september   general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  the increase is primarily due to a million increase in flight completion factor penalties involving our code share partners  a million increase in bad debt  and a million increase in software expenses 
legal expenses increased by million due to litigation involving go  freedom  and our chinese joint venture 
outside services increased by million due to professional consulting expenses  auditing fees and other outside services

interest expense in the year ended september   interest expense decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  this decrease is largely attributable to lower aircraft interest rates and fewer aircraft in the fleet  which significantly reduced the total aircraft interest

income taxes in fiscal  our effective tax rate changed from for fiscal to

in the event that the holders of the company s senior convertible notes due february exercise their right to require the company to repurchase the notes on february  at a price of per note  the company could be obligated to pay up to million in fiscal the company may pay the purchase price of such notes in cash  common stock  or a combination thereof

on march  delta notified the company of its intent to terminate the delta connection agreement among delta  the company  and the company s wholly owned subsidiary  freedom airlines  inc  alleging failure to maintain a specified completion rate with respect to its erj delta connection flights during three months of the six month period ended february following delta s termination notification  the company filed a complaint on april  in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief 
an evidentiary hearing was conducted on may through may  following the hearing  the court ruled in the company s favor and issued a preliminary injunction against delta 
the effect of this ruling is to prohibit delta from terminating the delta connection agreement covering the erj aircraft operated by freedom  based on freedom s completion rate prior to april  pending a final trial at a date to be determined by the court 
on june   delta filed a notice of appeal and on july   delta filed a motion requesting that the appeal be heard on an expedited basis 
the company intends to respond to delta s motion and notice of appeal in accordance with the applicable rules 
the outcome of delta s motion will determine the timing of subsequent deadlines 
prior to the court s ruling  delta planned to remove from service a significant portion of the aircraft in early june and all aircraft in july and forward 
delta did not immediately reverse its plans based upon the court s ruling 
following the court s ruling the company and delta reached an interim financial understanding subject to the mutual reservation of rights in which delta will reimburse the company for certain fixed and variable costs  as well as an agreed upon profit component and the majority of the erj aircraft will remain out of service until october while the company s cash flows from operations and its available capital have been sufficient to meet its current operating expenses  lease obligations and debt service requirements to date  the company s future cash flow from operations and available capital will be negatively impacted by i our ability to secure more flexible credit terms from certain of the company s other key vendors  ii reduced cash payments from our code share partners related to disputed items under our agreements  iii the million in aggregate remaining principal amount of senior convertible notes due  which the company may be required to repurchase on january  in accordance with the forbearance agreements described above  iv the million in aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due  which the company may be required to repurchase on february   v the company s ability to restructure certain of its aircraft lease obligations and key vendor obligations  and vi the results of the company s ongoing litigation with delta 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in effecting amended lease terms for its existing aircraft lease obligations and obtaining flexible credit terms from existing vendors and suppliers 
unfavorable events arising with respect to negotiations with key lessors and vendors  the delta litigation  or the and or notes could give rise to covenant and payment defaults under the terms of the company s material operating leases and indebtedness 
in the absence of obtaining additional capital through asset sales  consensual restructuring of debt and lease terms and or similar measures  the company may be unable to remedy such defaults and may experience additional defaults in the future 
the company s operating leases are subject to termination in the event of default  and the company s indebtedness may be accelerated in the event of continuing default 
certain lenders could foreclose on company assets securing their indebtedness 
accordingly  the company s financial condition could require that the company seek additional protection under applicable reorganization laws in order to avoid or delay actions by its creditors and lessors which could materially adversely affect the company s operations and ability to operate as a going concern 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the four categories above that they believe may have material current or future effect on financial condition  liquidity or results of operations

maintenance commitments in april  we entered into a year engine maintenance contract with pratt whitney canada corp 
pwc for our dash aircraft 
the contract requires us to pay pwc for the engine overhaul upon completion of the maintenance based upon a fixed dollar amount per flight hour 
the rate under the contract is subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices 
in april  we entered into a year engine maintenance contract with rolls royce allison rolls royce for its erj aircraft 
the contract requires us to pay rolls royce for the engine overhaul upon completion of the maintenance based upon a fixed dollar amount per flight hour 
the rate per flight hour is based upon certain operational assumptions and may vary if the engines are operated differently than these assumptions 
the rate is also subject to escalation based on changes in certain price indices 
the agreement with rolls royce also contains a termination clause and look back provision to provide for any shortfall between the cost of maintenance incurred by the provider and the amount paid up to the termination date by us and includes a penalty on such amount 
we do not anticipate an early termination under the contract 
in august  we entered into a ten year agreement with aar corp 
the aar agreement  for the management and repair of certain of our crj   and erj aircraft rotable spare parts inventory 
under the agreement  the company sold certain existing spare parts inventory to aar for million in cash and million in notes receivable to be paid over four years

in connection with the termination of the mcmp agreement  in july mesa entered into an agreement with an effective date of june   with ge for the maintenance repair  and overhaul of mesa s cf crj engines agreement 
the agreement is an exclusive year agreement with respect to the maintenance  repair and overhaul of said engines 
capital contribution commitment to kunpeng under the terms of the joint venture agreement  shenzhen airlines and the company are obligated to contribute an additional rmb  and rmb  approximately million and million  respectively  at september  to kunpeng in accordance with kunpeng s operational requirements as determined by kunpeng s board of directors  but in any event  prior to may  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  medical claims and workers compensation claims reserves  impairment of long lived assets and valuation of assets held for sale  costs to return aircraft  litigation claims and assessments and a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
such historical experience and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which contains accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
revenue recognition the delta  united and us airways regional jet code share agreements are revenue guarantee flying agreements 
under a revenue guarantee arrangement  the major airline generally pays a fixed monthly minimum amount  plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights flown and block hours performed 
the contracts also include reimbursement of certain costs incurred by us in performing flight services 
these costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes as well as  fuel  landing fees and catering 
the contracts also include a profit component that may be determined based on a percentage of profits on the mesa flown flights  a profit margin on certain reimbursable costs as well as a profit margin based on certain operational benchmarks 
we recognize revenue under our revenue guarantee agreements when the transportation is provided 
the majority of the revenue under these contracts is known at the end of the accounting period and is booked as actual 
we perform an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed 
under the company s revenue guarantee agreements with delta  united and us airways  the company is reimbursed under a fixed rate per block hour plus an amount per aircraft designed to reimburse the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  the company has concluded that a component of its revenue under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively  and has been included in passenger revenue on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
revenue from our independent operation is recognized when transportation is provided 
tickets sold but not yet used are included in air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as part of delta s bankruptcy  we reached an agreement with delta for an amendment to and assumption of our existing code sharing agreement amended dca  as well as for a new code sharing agreement expansion dca 
the compensation structure for the expansion dca is similar to the structure in the amended dca  except that the crj aircraft will be owned by delta and leased to us for a nominal amount and no mark up or incentive compensation will be paid on fuel costs above a certain level or on fuel provided by delta 
additionally  certain major maintenance expense items engine and airframe will be reimbursed based on actual expenses incurred 
as a result  our revenue and expenses attributable to flying the crj s will be substantially less than if we provided the aircraft 
we also received subsidies for providing scheduled air service to certain small or rural communities 
such revenue is recognized in the period in which the air service is provided 
the amount of the subsidy payments is determined by the united states department of transportation on the basis of its evaluation of the amount of revenue needed to meet operating expenses and to provide a reasonable return on investment with respect to eligible routes 
eas rates are normally set for two year contract periods for each city 
allowance for doubtful accounts amounts billed by the company under revenue guarantee arrangements are subject to our interpretation of the applicable code share agreement and are subject to audit by our code share partners 
periodically our code share partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed 
ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon mesa prevailing under audit  but also upon the financial well being of the code share partner 
as such  we periodically review amounts past due and record a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at september  and  respectively 
if our actual ability to collect these receivables and the actual financial viability of our partners is materially different than estimated  our estimate of the allowance could be materially misstated 
during fiscal  we increased the allowance by million to account for disputes with our code share partners regarding the fees payable under our agreements and by million to account for other potentially uncollectible accounts 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reached a settlement with respect to a dispute with us airways related to fees payable pursuant to the code share agreement 
in settlement of this dispute through july  us airways agreed to pay us a lump sum of million plus agreed upon monthly amounts per aircraft for the period commencing in august through the balance of the agreement 
aircraft leases the majority of the company s aircraft are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that the company and or one of its partners decide to exit an activity involving leased aircraft  losses may be incurred related to such an activity 
in the event that the company exits an activity that results in exit losses as in the case of the dash s previously discussed  these losses are accrued as each aircraft is removed from operations for early termination penalties  lease settle up and other charges 
accrued health care costs we are currently self insured up to a cap for health care costs and as such  a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet dates is estimated 
our estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of our health care provider 
at september  and  we accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost of future health care claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the accrual for future health care claims could be materially misstated 
accrued worker s compensation costs under our workers compensation program  we are self insured up to a cap for worker s compensation claims and as such  a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet date is estimated 
our estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of our third party administrator 
at september  and  we accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost of worker s compensation claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the accrual for future worker s compensation claims could be materially misstated 
long lived assets  aircraft and parts held for sale property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values using the straight line method 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if an impairment loss has occurred  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to fair value 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
as previously discussed  we recorded significant losses in fiscal related to the impairment of long lived assets 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carry forward  capital loss carry forward  and state and federal net operating loss carry forward 
we periodically review these assets to determine the likelihood of realization based upon expected taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent we believe some portion of the benefit may not be realizable  an estimate of the unrealized portion is made and an allowance is recorded 
at september  and  we had a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
in  the valuation was against certain state net operating loss carry forward related to the discontinued operations 
we believe  based upon our projections that it is more likely than not we will not be able to generate sufficient taxable income in these jurisdictions in time to realize the benefits of these recorded deferred tax assets 
as a result of continued losses in as well as uncertainties involving the settlement of certain obligations to note holders and ongoing litigation the company determined it was more likely than not that it would not be able to utilize all of its nols and established a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
in the event the company issues a significant number of shares it is possible that this will trigger a section limitation on the utilization of the company s nol s 
this could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
in adopting fin  we changed our methodology for estimating our potential liability for income tax position for which we are uncertain regardless of whether taxing authorities will challenge our interpretation of the income tax laws 
previously  we recorded a liability computed the statutory income tax rate if we determined that i we did not believe that it is probable that we would prevail and the uncertainty is not related to the timing of recognition 
however  under fin we do not recognize any benefits in our financial statements for any uncertain income tax position if we believe the position in the aggregate has less than a likelihood that the position will be sustained  we recognize a benefit in our financial statements equal to the largest amount that we believe is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit 
as a result of implementing fin the only effect on the company was to reclassify a million tax reserve from long term deferred income tax liability to other noncurrent liabilities under fin no other changes resulting from implementing fin were necessary 
the tax law is subject to varied interpretation  and we have taken positions related to certain matters where the law is subject to interpretation and where substantial amounts of income tax benefits have been recorded in our financial statements 
as we become aware of new interpretations of the relevant tax laws and as we discuss our interpretations with taxing authorities  we may in the future change our assessments of the likelihood of sustainability or of the amounts that may or may not be sustained upon audit 
and as our assessments change  the impact to our financial statements could be material 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for these matters are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year management believes that it will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
aug air accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this position amends the existing major maintenance accounting guidance contained within the aicpa industry audit guide audits of airlines and prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities for owned aircraft 
the provisions of the announcement are applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  mesa currently uses the direct expense method of accounting for planned major maintenance  therefore  the adoption of fsp no 
aug air did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
under sfas  companies have an opportunity to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company doesn t anticipate adopting at this time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r business combinations 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 business combinations however it retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting which statement called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this statement defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses and establishes the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control 
statement did not define the acquirer  although it included guidance on identifying the acquirer  as does this statement 
this statement s scope is broader than that of sfas  which applied only to business combinations in which control was obtained by transferring consideration 
by applying the same method of accounting to all transaction and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses  this statement improves the comparability of the information and business combinations provided in financial reports 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company will be required to apply sfas no 
r beginning in the first quarter of fiscal management believes that it will not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
an amendment of arb no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements a non controlling interest  sometimes called a minority interest  is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
the objective of this statement is to improve the relevance  comparability and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding non controlling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary 
this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal management believes that this will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
this standard expands upon the implementation guidance in sfas no 
for estimating the present value of future cash flows for some hard to value financial instruments  such as collateralized debt obligations 
this statement became effective upon issuance 
the company doesn t believe that sfas will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued eitf equity method investment accounting considerations  on how the initial carrying value of an equity method investment should be determined  how an impairment assessment of an underlying indefinite lived intangible asset of an equity method investment should be performed  and how an equity method investee s issuance of shares should be accounted for 
the company has not evaluated the impact of this issue draft on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term marketable investment portfolio 
certain of our debt obligations are variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in an approximately million impact on interest expense 
we also have investments in debt securities 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in fiscal year interest income would be impacted by approximately million 
we have exposure to certain market risks associated with our aircraft fuel 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly impact a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they insure availability of supply 
however  the delta  united and us airways revenue guarantee code share agreements allow fuel costs to be reimbursed by the code share partner  thereby reducing our overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations
