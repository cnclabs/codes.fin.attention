financial contracts and market risk we conduct business on a global basis in us and foreign currencies  so our financial results are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we have a foreign currency exposure management program  which uses derivative foreign exchange contracts to address nonfunctional currency exposures that are expected to be settled in one year or less 
we enter into derivative foreign exchange contracts only to the extent necessary to meet our goal of mitigating nonfunctional foreign currency exposures 
we do not enter into hedging transactions for speculative purposes 
the derivative foreign exchange contracts consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts 

table of contents derivative financial contracts involve elements of market and credit risk not recognized in the financial statements 
the market risk that results from these contracts relates to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which generally are offset by changes in the value of the underlying assets or liabilities being held 
credit risk relates to the risk of nonperformance by a counterparty to one of our derivative contracts 
we do not believe there is a significant credit risk associated with our hedging activities 
we monitor the counterparties credit ratings and other market data to minimize credit risk 
in addition  we also limit the aggregate contract amount entered into with any one financial institution to mitigate credit risk
