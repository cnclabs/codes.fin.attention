the company reported net loss of  million or diluted loss earnings per share eps of for  compared to net earnings of million and eps for the change in eps resulted primarily from a  million pre tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangibles  a charge of million to record a tax valuation allowance against the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset recognized in the fourth quarter of  lower sales volumes  rising raw material and energy costs and business restructurings 
during  the company paid down approximately million in debt 
the company believes that industry demand for the products manufactured by the company will continue to be impacted by the softened demand that began in the fourth quarter of and worsened considerably during the later parts of the global economy continues in the most significant downturn in recent history 
overall economic conditions and consumer sentiment have continued to deteriorate  which has intensified the pressure on the demand for housing and  as a result  the company s products 
as the company slowed production and raw materials purchases in the fourth quarter to reduce inventory in response to reduced demand  the proportion of higher cost products in inventory increased 
consequently  the company anticipates that its margins and earnings will be negatively impacted until demand for the company s products increases and the portion of higher cost products in inventory declines as higher cost inventory flows through earnings 
although the company cannot determine with certainty as to when the deteriorating market conditions will stabilize and begin to improve  the company believes it is well positioned in the long term as the industry improves 
the company continues to monitor expenses and manufacturing capacity based on current industry conditions and will continue to adjust as required

critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  the company must make decisions which impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  the company applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances and historical experience 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of those significant accounting policies require the company to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and represent critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable  and collectability can be reasonably assured 
the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost has been determined using the first in first out method fifo 
costs included in inventory include raw materials  direct and indirect labor and employee benefits  depreciation  general manufacturing overhead and various other costs of manufacturing 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which is a function of historical usage  anticipated future selling price  expected sales below cost  excessive quantities and an evaluation for obsolescence 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete inventory  excessive inventory or inventory expected to be sold below cost and additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances 
the company considers the relationship between its market capitalization and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators of impairment 
the goodwill impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using the discounted cash flows and comparable company market valuation approaches 
the company has identified mohawk  dal tile  unilin flooring  unilin chipboard and melamine  and unilin roofing as its reporting units for the purposes of allocating goodwill and intangibles as well as assessing impairments 
the valuation approaches are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change such as judgments and assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  operating margins  weighted average cost of capital wacc  and comparable company market multiples 
when developing these key judgments and assumptions  the company considers economic  operational and market conditions that could impact the fair value of the reporting unit 
however  estimates are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectations regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
should a significant or prolonged deterioration in economic conditions occur  such as continued declines in spending for new construction  remodeling and replacement activities  the inability to pass increases in the costs of raw materials and fuel on to customers  or a decline in comparable company market multiples  then key judgments and assumptions could be impacted 
generally  a moderate decline in estimated operating income or a small increase in wacc or a decline in market capitalization could result in an additional indication of impairment 
the impairment test for intangible assets not subject to amortization involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  royalty rates  wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows 
these judgments and assumptions are subject to the variability discussed above 
the impairment evaluation for indefinite lived intangible assets  which for the company are its trademarks  is conducted during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the trademarks 
significant 
table of contents 
index to financial statements judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  royalty rates  wacc and the amount of expected future cash flows 
the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with past performance and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the trademarks 
estimated cash flows are sensitive to changes in the economy among other things 
the company reviews long lived assets  including its intangible assets subject to amortization which  for the company are its patents and customer relationships  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long lived assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the company conducted its annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the fourth quarter and no impairment was indicated 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company conducted interim impairment tests and recorded impairment of goodwill and other intangibles of  million and million  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate is based on its income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which it operates 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s tax expense and in evaluating the company s tax positions 
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in a future period 
the company evaluates the recoverability of these future tax benefits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income inherently rely on estimates  including business forecasts and other projections of financial results over an extended period of time 
in the event that the company does not expect to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is provided 
the company would recognize such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted 
in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying the company s income tax positions 
the company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon the company s evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  the company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  as required by the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
environmental and legal accruals are estimates based on judgments made by the company relating to ongoing environmental and legal proceedings  as disclosed in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in determining whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable  the company consults with its internal experts 
the company believes that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements are based on the best estimates and judgments available to it
