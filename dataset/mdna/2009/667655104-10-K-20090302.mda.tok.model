item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s nw natural financial condition  including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to our consolidated activities for the years ended december   and unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nw natural and its wholly owned subsidiaries  nng financial corporation financial corporation and gill ranch storage  llc gill ranch  and an equity investment in a proposed natural gas pipeline 
these accounts consist of our regulated local gas distribution business  our regulated gas storage business  and other regulated and non regulated investments primarily in energy related businesses 
in this report  the term utility is used to describe our regulated local gas distribution segment  and the term non utility is used to describe our gas storage segment gas storage and our other regulated and non regulated investments and business activities other segment see strategic opportunities  below  and note 
in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings 
we believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on earnings 
all references in this section to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares see note 
executive summary highlights of consolidated net income was million  or per share  net operating revenues decreased percent from million to million  largely due to a million swing in our utility s sharing of higher gas costs  operations and maintenance expense decreased percent or million  cash flow from operations decreased million due to temporary working capital requirements  while our credit and liquidity position remained strong  general rate case was approved in washington with a million increase in annual revenues  effective january   permit applications were filed for our gas storage project in california and our gas transmission pipeline project in oregon  keeping these strategic investment opportunities on track for potential development over the next few years  we ranked number one in the nation among gas utilities in the jd power and associates gas utility residential customer satisfaction survey  and we raised the quarterly common stock dividend by percent to per share in the fourth quarter of  making this the rd consecutive year of increasing dividends paid to shareholders 
our business primarily consists of our regulated utility and gas storage operations 
factors critical to the success of the utility business include maintaining a safe and reliable distribution system  acquiring an adequate supply of natural gas  providing distribution services at competitive prices  and being able to recover our operating and capital costs in the rates charged to customers in a 
table of contents reasonable and timely manner 
our utility is regulated by two state commissions  the oregon public utility commission opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc 
factors critical to the success of our gas storage business include developing additional storage capacity at competitive market prices  retaining existing customers or being able to market storage capacity to new customers  planning for the replacement of capacity that is expected to be recalled by the utility to serve growing demands of its customers  obtaining timely approval of reasonable rate increases  and with respect to future development of gas storage projects  being able to obtain financing to fund future development 
our existing gas storage business charges rates that are approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate customers or the opuc for intrastate customers 
the gill ranch gas storage project currently under development will be subject to regulation by the california public utilities commission cpuc  upon completion of certain milestones see outlook strategic opportunities gas storage development  below 
outlook in  we intend to remain focused on improving our core businesses  enhancing our strategic position  advancing business development projects related to our primary businesses  and strengthening our organizational effectiveness 
the following is a brief summary of management s plans and objectives in these four areas 
business improvements 
we are developing and implementing new technology into our operations while honing the new processes established by the changes to our operating model over the last several years 
our goal is to integrate  consolidate and streamline operations and support our employees with new technology tools that should enable us to become more effective and efficient 
we intend to continue developing new technology such as an enterprise resource planning system  which provides an integrated comprehensive suite of business application software to more efficiently process and manage information in all parts of our business  continued deployment of our new automated dispatching system throughout the business  which provides integrated planning and scheduling with global positioning capabilities to more effectively collect and distribute data to employees in remote locations  and completing the installation of our automated meter reading system  which will convert the remaining customer meters so that all of our meters can be read electronically by the end of we expect these and other new technologies to continue supporting our new operating model  which re aligned our operating functions into key process areas such as customer services  energy supply and gas delivery  to help centralize and standardize all of our business operations 
for further discussion  see strategic opportunities  below 
strategic position 
in our rapidly changing business environment  we remain focused on creating shareholder value while balancing the interests of our customers  employees and the communities we serve 
in doing so  we intend to develop and re work plans in response to our changing business environment  including potential climate change legislation as well as ongoing economic  regulatory  business development and workforce challenges and opportunities 
for further discussion  see issues  challenges and performance measures  and strategic opportunities  below 
business development 
in addition to exploring new growth opportunities  we intend to continue advancing key natural gas infrastructure investments during  including our gas transmission pipeline project in oregon and our gas storage project in california 
for further discussion of these two projects  see strategic opportunities  below 
organizational effectiveness 
our employees continue to be our most highly valued resource 
we intend to continue supporting our employees with a positive work environment  providing 
table of contents development training  and developing new technologies to achieve our goals and facilitate improvements to our operating model 
for further discussion see strategic opportunities  below 
issues  challenges and performance measures managing the business in a period of gas price volatility 
our gas acquisition strategy is primarily designed to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility s residential  commercial and industrial customers on firm service 
equally important  however  is our strategy to hedge gas prices for a significant portion of our annual purchase requirements based upon our utility s gas load forecast for core utility customers 
we have hedged gas prices for the majority of our gas purchases for the gas contract year that began on november   and we believe we have sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our core utility customers 
although gas prices reached historically high levels during the third quarter of  the price of natural gas has declined significantly in recent months and is currently below the prices embedded in our customers rates through our annual purchased gas adjustment pga 
gas costs lower or higher than those set in the pga may positively or negatively impact earnings  respectively  due to an incentive sharing mechanism in oregon 
higher gas costs are also likely to affect our competitive advantage because they could reduce our ability to add residential and commercial customers and potentially cause industrial customers to shift their energy needs to alternative fuel sources 
in october  the opuc approved a change to the pga incentive sharing mechanism that allows us to select a cost sharing ratio annually 
the pga cost sharing ratio  along with gas hedging strategies and inventories in storage  enables us to manage and reduce earnings risk exposure due to higher gas costs 
we believe the modification to the oregon pga better aligns customer and shareholder interests 
in washington  where we recover percent of our actual gas purchase costs from customers  there has been no change to the pga mechanism see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
economic weakness and financial market stress 
the overall weakness in the us economy  including disruption in the global credit and financial markets  increasing numbers of foreclosures and bankruptcies  lower rates of new housing construction  and volatility in energy prices  has resulted in significant negative pressure on consumer demand and business spending 
these conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results including certain key performance measures such as margins  customer growth rates  bad debt expense  and net interest charges 
our customer growth rate  which in recent years has slowed but continues at a rate above the national average  declined to percent during compared to percent in based on current market conditions  we expect customer growth rates in to continue at or near levels  or possibly lower if economic conditions deteriorate further  but our growth rate should remain above the national average due to a relatively low market penetration of natural gas in our service territory  the forecasted population growth in our service territory  the potential for environmental initiatives in oregon and washington that could favor natural gas as an energy source  and our efforts to convert existing homes from other heating fuels to natural gas 
our funding for strategic investment opportunities is dependent upon our ability to access capital markets and maintain working capital sufficient to meet operating requirements 
we intend to continue focusing on maintaining a strong balance sheet  providing sufficient liquidity resources  monitoring and managing critical business risks  and securing  as needed  proceeds from the issuance of equity or long term debt securities in order to fund utility and business development capital expenditures 
to help mitigate the effect of the negative economic and capital market trends referred to 
table of contents above  we expect to manage costs  extend short term debt maturities  maintain higher cash balances  increase the aggregate commitment amount under existing or new credit facilities as needed  and access capital markets to secure proceeds from the issuance of long term securities for capital expenditure requirements 
if we are unable to secure financing to fund certain strategic opportunities  we may look at potentially re prioritizing the use of existing resources or consider delaying investments until market conditions improve 
we believe that  despite the current economic and credit market environment  our financial condition  including our liquidity position  is strong and we can access capital at reasonable costs 
see part i  item a  risk factors  above and financial condition liquidity and capital resources  below 
strategic opportunities business process improvements 
to address our economic and competitive challenges  we intend to re assess business processes for continuous improvements 
our goal is to integrate  consolidate and streamline operations and support our employees with new technology tools that enable us to become more effective and efficient 
in  we implemented the first phase of our new enterprise resource planning erp system  and in february we implemented the second phase 
this new erp system provides a comprehensive suite of business application software that interfaces with our existing customer information and automated dispatching systems 
we expect this new erp system to improve overall operating efficiencies by automating the integration of systems and data  the control procedures with auditable financial and operational workflows  and certain areas of our monthly closing and financial reporting process 
in  we automated the reading of gas meters on approximately one third of our customers meters 
the meters equipped with this technology now electronically transmit usage data to receiving devices located in our vehicles as they are driven in the area  substantially reducing the labor costs associated with manually reading those customer meters 
in  we initiated a project to automate the reading of gas meters amr for our remaining customers 
the capital cost of this project is estimated to be million  and in january we filed for regulatory recovery of this investment 
also in  we initiated an automated dispatching system  which provides integrated planning and scheduling with global positioning system capabilities to more effectively collect and distribute data 
these technology investments and other initiatives are expected to facilitate process improvements and contribute to long term operational efficiencies throughout nw natural 
pipeline diversification 
currently  we depend on a single interstate pipeline company to ship gas supplies to our system 
palomar gas transmission  llc  palomar is a wholly owned subsidiary of palomar gas holdings  llc  pgh 
pgh is owned percent by nw natural and percent by transcanada gas transmission northwest s gtn 
palomar is seeking to build and operate a mile natural gas transmission pipeline in oregon to serve our utility and the growing markets in oregon and other parts of the western united states 
the palomar pipeline would extend west from an interconnection with gtn s existing interstate transmission mainline near madras  oregon to an interconnection with nw natural s gas distribution system near molalla  oregon and then extend further west to additional interconnections including a possible connection to one of the several liquefied natural gas lng terminals proposed to be built on the columbia river 
palomar would 
table of contents diversify nw natural s delivery options and enhance the reliability of service to our utility customers by providing an alternate transportation path for gas purchases from different regions in western canada and the us rocky mountains 
palomar would also provide our utility customers with access to a new source of gas supply if an lng terminal is built on the columbia river 
the palomar pipeline would be regulated by the ferc 
in december  palomar filed for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the ferc 
palomar continues to work on the planning and permitting phase of the project  which is expected to extend through the total cost for planning and permitting is estimated to be between million and million  percent of which is our investment based on our ownership interest 
at december   the amount we had invested was million 
the total cost estimate for the entire mile pipeline  if constructed  is estimated to be between million and million  with our current percent share estimated at between approximately million and million 
during and  pgh will continue to evaluate market conditions and project status to determine if and when to proceed with construction of all or some portion of the project 
palomar has executed binding precedent agreements with shippers  including our own utility  for a majority of the current design capacity on the pipeline 
these agreements also provide commitments of credit support to the project 
we will continue to assess project risks and evaluate the project costs and fair value of our investment on a quarterly basis  including a valuation of the available credit support 
gas storage development 
in september  we announced a joint project with pacific gas electric company pg e to develop an underground natural gas storage facility near fresno  california 
we formed a wholly owned subsidiary  gill ranch  to plan  develop and operate the facility 
in july  gill ranch filed an application with the cpuc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity 
in december  the cpuc indicated that our application qualified for a mitigated negative declaration  which allows an expedited review process 
we expect to establish the application review schedule with the cpuc early in and to receive a decision on our application by the end of gill ranch will become subject to cpuc regulation regarding various matters including  but not limited to  securities issuances  lien grants and sales of property 
we estimate our share of the total cost of this project to be between and million 
our share represents percent of the total cost of the initial phase of storage development for an estimated bcf of gas storage capacity and approximately miles of gas transmission pipeline during the to period 
the initial phase of gas storage at gill ranch is currently scheduled to be in service by late earnings and dividends net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
returns on equity for these three years were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
compared to factors contributing to decreased earnings were a million loss in utility margin from our regulatory share of gas cost increases in compared to a margin gain of million in from gas cost decreases  a million decrease in utility margin from a lower customer surcharge related to regulatory adjustments for income taxes paid  
table of contents a million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to increased utility plant in service  a million decrease in margin due to a temporary mark to market gain in  and a million decrease in utility margin from industrial customers due to weaker economic conditions 
partially offsetting the above factors were a million increase in utility margin from higher sales volumes to residential and commercial customers due to colder weather and customer growth  after decoupling and weather mechanism adjustments  a million decrease in operation and maintenance expense  partially due to higher costs in for strategic initiatives  and partially due to lower bonuses and employee benefit costs in  a million decrease in income tax expense due to lower taxable income  a million after tax gain from the sale of our investment in an aircraft leased to a commercial airline  and a million increase in utility margin due to curtailment charges for use by a small number of industrial customers during cold weather 
compared to positive factors contributing to increased earnings were a million increase in utility margin from higher sales volumes to residential and commercial customers due to customer growth  a million increase in utility margin from a regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  a million increase in utility margin from our regulatory share of gas cost savings  up from million in to million in a million increase in utility margin from temporary mark to market adjustments on derivative contracts  with a million gain realized in and a million loss realized in  and a million increase in margin from gas storage operations  due to an expansion of firm storage capacity and higher revenues sharing from asset optimization 
partially offsetting the above positive factors were a million increase in depreciation expense  primarily related to increased utility plant in service  a million increase in operations and maintenance expense due to higher bonuses tied to improved operating results and increases for certain strategic initiatives including utility maintenance projects and training  and a million increase in income tax expense related to higher taxable income 
dividends paid on our common stock were a share in  compared to a share in and a share in the current indicated annual dividend rate is per share 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of 
table of contents accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers our critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if we reported under different conditions or used different assumptions 
our most critical estimates and judgments include accounting for regulatory cost recovery and amortizations  revenue recognition  derivative instruments and hedging activities  pensions  income taxes  and environmental contingencies 
management has discussed the estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
within the context of our critical accounting policies and estimates  management is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  see note regulatory accounting we are regulated by the opuc and wutc  which establish our utility rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers  and  to a certain extent  set forth the accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  we use the same accounting principles as non regulated companies reporting under gaap 
however  certain accounting principles  primarily statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation 
for example  we account for the cost of gas using a pga deferral and cost recovery mechanism  which is submitted for approval annually to the opuc and wutc see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
there are other expenses or revenues that the opuc or wutc may require us to defer for recovery or refund in future periods 
sfas no 
requires us to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when we are allowed to recover these expenses from or required to refund them to customers  we recognize the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time we realize the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates charged to customers 
the conditions we must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of sfas no 
 which are applicable to regulated companies  include an independent regulator sets rates  the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
we continue to apply sfas no 
in accounting for our regulated utility operations 
future regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could require us to discontinue the 
table of contents application of sfas no 
for some or all of our regulated businesses 
this would require the write off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers 
based on current regulatory and competitive conditions  we believe that it is reasonable to expect continued application of sfas no 
for our regulated activities  and that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities at december  and are recoverable or refundable through future customer rates 
see note  industry regulation 
revenue recognition utility revenues  derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas  are recognized when gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed  based on estimates of gas deliveries from the last meter reading date to month end accrued unbilled revenues 
accrued unbilled revenues are primarily based on a percentage estimate of our unbilled gas deliveries each month  which is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which require management s judgment 
these factors include total gas receipts and deliveries  customer meter reading dates  customer usage patterns and weather 
accrued unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
estimated unbilled revenues at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in accrued unbilled revenues at year end was primarily due to higher volumes reflecting colder weather and higher gas prices included in customer rates 
if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at december  was adjusted up or down by percent  then our unbilled revenues  net operating revenues and net income would have increased or decreased by an estimated million  million and million  respectively 
utility revenues may also include the recognition of a regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid 
this revenue adjustment reflects an opuc rule whereby we are required to implement a rate refund or a rate surcharge to utility customers 
this refund or surcharge is accrued based on the estimated difference between income taxes paid and income taxes authorized to be collected in rates for the tax year see results of operations business segments utility operations regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  below 
non utility revenues  derived primarily from our gas storage business segment  are recognized upon delivery of the service to customers 
revenues from asset optimization  which are included in our gas storage segment  are recognized when services are provided by the independent energy marketing company in accordance with our contractual agreement 
our current asset optimization agreement includes guaranteed amounts which are recognized pro rata on a monthly basis over the contract term 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities our financial derivatives and gas acquisition policies set forth guidelines for using financial derivative instruments to support prudent risk management strategies 
these policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the accounting rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex 
the contracts that meet the definition of a derivative instrument are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
if certain regulatory conditions are met  then the fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to sfas no 
see note  industry regulation  and no gain or loss is recognized in current income 
the gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument that is subject to regulatory deferral is 
table of contents included in the recovery from  or refund to  utility customers in future periods see regulatory accounting  above 
if a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral  then the accounting treatment for gains and losses is recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 collectively referred to as sfas no 
see note  derivatives and industry regulation 
derivative contracts outstanding at december  were measured at fair value using models or other market accepted valuation methodologies derived from observable market data 
the estimate of fair value may change significantly from period to period depending on market conditions and prices 
these changes may have an impact on our results of operations  but the impact would largely be mitigated due to the majority of our derivatives activities being subject to regulatory deferral treatment 
for estimated fair values on unrealized gains and losses at december  and  see note commodity based derivative contracts entered into by the utility after our annual pga filing for the current gas contract period are subject to a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
the portion not deferred to a regulatory account pursuant to that sharing agreement is recognized either in current income for contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting or in other comprehensive income for contracts qualifying for hedge accounting 
our interest rate swap qualifies for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 assuming the swap is highly effective 
derivative hedge contracts are subject to a hedge effectiveness test to determine the financial statement treatment of each specific derivative 
as of december   all of our derivatives were effective economic hedges and either qualified or were expected to qualify for regulatory deferral or hedge accounting treatment 
we use the hypothetical derivative method under sfas no 
to determine the hedge effectiveness of our interest rate swap which qualifies as a cash flow hedge 
we extended the effective date of our interest rate swap from december  to april  which resulted in an ineffectiveness of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have reclassified this amount to regulatory assets 
the ineffectiveness for all other derivative contracts is determined using the dollar offset method under sfas no 
the effectiveness test applied to financial derivatives is dependent on the type of derivative and its use 
the following table summarizes the amount of realized gains and losses from commodity price and currency hedge transactions for the last three years thousands net gain loss on commodity price swaps utility net gain loss on commodity price options utility subtotal on commodity utility net gain loss on foreign currency forward purchases utility total realized net gain loss realized gains losses from commodity hedges and foreign currency forward purchase contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
realized gains losses from interest rate hedges are recorded as reductions increases to interest charges over the term of the underlying debt issuances 
unrealized gains and losses from commodity hedges  foreign currency contracts and interest rate hedges  which reflect quarterly mark to market valuations  are generally not recognized in current income or other comprehensive income  but are recorded as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  and are offset by a corresponding balance in non trading derivative assets or liabilities see note 

table of contents accounting for pensions we maintain two qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our regular employees with more than one year of service  several non qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees and other employee postretirement benefit plans 
only the two qualified defined benefit pension plans have plan assets  which are held in a qualified trust to fund retirement benefits 
effective january   the retirement plan for non bargaining unit employees and the welfare benefits plan for non bargaining unit employees were closed to anyone hired or rehired 
instead  non bargaining unit employees hired or re hired after december  are provided an enhanced retirement k savings plan benefit 
benefits provided to bargaining unit employees under the retirement plan for bargaining unit employees were not affected by these changes 
net periodic pension costs pension costs and projected benefit obligations benefit obligations are determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  using a number of key assumptions including discount rates  rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and the expected long term return on plan assets see note 
these key assumptions have a significant impact on the amounts reported 
pension costs consist of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains  losses and prior service costs  the expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets 
the market related valuation reflects differences between expected returns and actual investment returns  which are recognized over a three year period from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year volatility in pension costs 
sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension plans in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of tax  based on the fair value of plan assets compared to the actuarial value of future benefit obligations 
however  the pension costs relating to certain nw natural pension plans are recovered in utility rates based on sfas no 
 and as such we received regulatory approval from the opuc pursuant to sfas no 
to record the overfunded or underfunded status as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability  rather than including it as aoci under common equity see regulatory accounting  above  and note  industry regulation 
a number of factors are considered in developing pension assumptions  including evaluations of relevant discount rates  an evaluation of expected long term investment returns based on asset classes and target asset allocations  and expected changes in salaries and wages  analyses of past retirement plan experience and current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the december  measurement date  we reviewed and updated our pension discount rate assumptions from a range of to percent to a range of to percent 
the new rate assumptions were determined for each plan based on a matching of the estimated cash flow  which reflects the timing and amount of future benefit payments  to the citigroup above median curve  which consists of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by standard poor s s p or aa or higher by moody s investors service moody s  our expected rate of future compensation increases from a range of to percent to a range of to percent  our expected long term return on plan assets remained unchanged at percent  and other key assumptions as needed 

table of contents at december   our net pension liability benefit obligations minus market value of plan assets for the two qualified defined benefit plans increased by million compared to poor equity and bond market performance had a significant impact on the fair value of plan assets resulting in the large increase in our unfunded pension liability 
changes in valuation assumptions impact our benefit obligations 
benefit obligations at december  increased million due to a decrease in our discount rate assumptions and increased by million due to updating our mortality tables 
we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate an analysis of historical actual performance and long term return projections  which gives consideration to the current asset mix and our target asset allocation 
as of december   the actual annualized returns on plan assets  net of management fees  for the past one year  five years  years and since december were percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we believe our pension assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions 
however  the following shows the sensitivity of our pension costs and benefit obligations to future changes in certain actuarial assumptions thousands  except percent change in assumption impact on pension costs impact on benefit obligations at dec 
 discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a the impact of a change in pension costs on operating results would be less than the amounts shown above because only between and percent of our pension costs is charged to operations and maintenance expense 
the remaining to percent is capitalized to construction accounts as payroll overhead and included in utility plant  which is amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset placed into service 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
and fin also require that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our net long term deferred tax liability totaled million at december  this liability is estimated based on the expected future tax consequences of items recognized in the financial statements 
after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income  judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our tax returns 
for state income tax and other taxes  judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we did not have a valuation allowance due to our expectation that all of these assets will be realized 

table of contents sfas no 
also requires the recognition of additional deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators require us to flow through deferred income tax benefits or expenses in the ratemaking process of the regulated utility regulatory tax assets and liabilities 
this is consistent with the ratemaking policies of the opuc and wutc 
regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent we believe they will be recoverable from  or refunded to  customers in future rates 
at december  and  we had regulatory assets representing differences between book and tax basis related to pre property of million and million  respectively  and recorded an offsetting deferred tax liability for the same amounts see note  income tax expense 
we received authorization from the opuc and wutc in to accelerate the recovery of these pre regulatory assets through future utility rates see regulatory accounting  above  and notes and 
contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
estimates of loss contingencies  including estimates of legal defense costs when such costs are probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable  and related disclosures are updated when new information becomes available 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
accruals for loss contingencies are recorded based on an analysis of potential results 
when information is sufficient to estimate only a range of potential liabilities  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  we recognize an accrued liability at the low end of the range and disclose the range see contingent liabilities  below 
it is possible  however  that the range of potential liabilities could be significantly different than amounts currently accrued and disclosed  with the result that our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in the assumptions or estimates related to these contingencies 
with respect to environmental liabilities and related costs we develop estimates based on a review of information available from recently completed studies and negotiations involving several sites 
using sampling data  feasibility studies  existing technology and enacted laws and regulations  we estimate that the total future expenditures for environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation are million as of december  it is our policy to accrue the full amount of such liability when information is sufficient to reasonably estimate the amount of probable liability 
when information is not available to reasonably estimate the probable liability  or when only the range of probable liabilities can be estimated and no amount within the range is more likely than another  then it is our policy to accrue at the lower end of the range 
accordingly  due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation and the preliminary nature of several site investigations  the range of potential loss beyond the amounts currently accrued  and the probabilities thereof  cannot be reasonably estimated 
therefore  we have recorded the liabilities at an amount that reflects the most likely estimate or the low end of the range 
we will continue to seek recovery of such costs through insurance and through customer rates  and we believe recovery of these costs is probable 
if it is determined that both the insurance recovery and future rate recovery of such costs are not probable  the costs will be charged to expense in the period such determination is made see note 
table of contents results of operations regulatory matters regulation and rates we are subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  rates and systems of accounts by the opuc  wutc and ferc 
the opuc and wutc also regulate our issuance of securities 
in  approximately percent of our utility gas volumes were delivered to  and utility operating revenues were derived from  oregon customers and the balance from washington customers 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the oregon and washington economies in general  and by the pace of growth in the residential and commercial markets in particular  and by our ability to remain price competitive  control expenses  and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery for our utility gas costs  operating and maintenance costs and investments made in utility plant 
general rate cases oregon 
in our most recent general rate increase in oregon  which was effective september   the opuc authorized rates to customers based on a return on shareholders equity roe of percent 
in  in connection with the renewal of our conservation tariff and weather normalization rate mechanism  the opuc approved a stipulation that restricts us from filing a general rate case with the opuc prior to september   subject to certain exceptions 
under the agreement  we would be allowed to file a general rate case if an extraordinary event occurs or significant investments are required on behalf of our customers and we are unable to reach agreement regarding alternative forms of cost recovery outside of a general rate case 
these exceptions might include additional investments in our pipeline integrity management program 
this agreement does not impact our ability to file annual rate adjustments to reflect changes in gas purchase costs under our pga mechanism or our ability to collect or refund prior year s gas cost deferrals 
see rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
washington 
in december  an all party stipulated agreement regarding our washington general rate case was approved by the wutc 
as part of the stipulation  the wutc authorized rates to our customers based on a roe of percent  which was consistent with a rate of return on total long term capitalization of percent 
these new customer rates went into effect on january  under these new rates  our annual revenue requirements will increase by approximately million  or percent 
although we agreed not to file another general rate case in washington before january  the parties agreed that we may file separately for a decoupling mechanism upon completion of a trial program currently being conducted by another utility  which is expected to be completed during federal 
we are required under our mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every three years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for our interstate storage services 
we filed a cost and revenue study and an associated petition for rate approval in april as a result of that proceeding  the current maximum cost based rates for our interstate gas storage services were approved by ferc in august  with our maximum rates unchanged from the levels approved by ferc in the maximum cost based rates are designed to reflect updated costs related to the further development of the mist gas storage facility from to additionally  we made a filing 
table of contents in december to obtain ferc approval to revise the depreciation rates associated with mist assets used to derive the cost based interstate storage rates 
in that proceeding  which is currently pending  we are requesting ferc approval to revise the depreciation rates used for the mist interstate storage services to match the depreciation rates for the same assets that were recently adjusted under state regulation 
we do not expect the approval of these new depreciation rates to have a material impact on our maximum rates approved by ferc  or any immediate impact on the actual rates currently charged to interstate storage customers 
rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment 
rate changes are established each year under pga mechanisms in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases  including contractual arrangements to hedge the purchase price with financial derivatives  interstate pipeline demand charges  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in deferred regulatory accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year 
in october  the opuc and wutc approved rate changes effective on november  under our pga mechanisms 
the effect of the rate changes was to increase the average monthly bills of oregon residential customers by percent and those of washington residential customers by percent 
additionally  in october  the opuc approved changes to our pga incentive sharing mechanism 
under the oregon pga mechanism  we collect an amount for purchased gas costs based on estimates included in rates 
if the actual purchased gas costs differ from the estimated amounts included in rates  then we are required to defer that difference and pass it on to customers as an adjustment to future rates 
under the prior oregon pga incentive sharing mechanism effective through october   percent of the difference was to be deferred such that the impact on current earnings is either a charge to expense for percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or a credit to expense for percent of the lower purchased gas costs 
under the new oregon pga incentive sharing mechanism  effective november   we are required to select  by august of each year  either an percent deferral or percent deferral of higher or lower gas costs such that the impact on current earnings from the gas cost sharing is either percent or percent  respectively 
as was the case under the prior mechanism  we will be subject to an annual earnings review to evaluate the utility s financial performance 
under both the prior and the new sharing mechanism  if earnings exceed a threshold level  then percent of the amount above the threshold will be deferred for future refund to customers 
under the prior oregon pga incentive mechanism  effective through the end of october  the deferral was percent of gas cost differences and the threshold level was equal to our authorized roe of percent plus basis points 
under the new mechanism  if we select the percent deferral  we retain all of our earnings up to basis points above the currently authorized roe  or if we select the percent deferral  we retain all of our earnings up to basis points above the currently authorized roe 
for the pga year in oregon beginning on november   we selected the percent deferral of gas cost differences 
the earnings threshold is currently subject to adjustment up or down each year depending on movements in long term interest rates 
in and  the earnings threshold after adjustment for long term interest rates was percent and percent  respectively 
no amounts were required to be refunded to customers as a 
table of contents result of the earnings review  and we do not expect that any amounts will be required to be refunded to customers as a result of the earnings review  which will be approved by the opuc during the second quarter of there has been no change to the washington pga mechanism under which we defer percent of the higher or lower actual purchased gas costs and pass that difference through to customers as an adjustment to future rates 
conservation tariff 
in october  the opuc authorized the implementation of a conservation tariff  which is a rate mechanism designed to adjust margin for changes in consumption patterns due to residential and commercial customers conservation efforts 
the tariff is a decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between utility earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by customers  removing any financial incentive by the utility to discourage customers conservation efforts 
in washington  customer use is not covered by a conservation tariff  and as such our utility earnings are affected by increases and decreases in usage based on customers conservation efforts 
washington customers account for about percent of our utility revenues 
the oregon conservation tariff includes two components a price elasticity adjustment  which adjusts rates annually for increases or decreases from expected customer volumes due to annual changes in commodity costs or periodic changes in our general rates  and a conservation adjustment calculated on a monthly basis to account for the difference between actual and expected volumes also referred to as the decoupling adjustment 
the margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes under the decoupling component is recorded to a deferral account  which is included in the next year s annual pga filing 
baseline consumption was determined by customer consumption data used in the oregon general rate case and is adjusted annually for customer growth and the effect of the price elasticity adjustment discussed above 
see results of operations comparison of gas distribution operations  below 
in  an independent study to measure the effectiveness of oregon s conservation tariff mechanism recommended continuation of the tariff with minor modifications  which the opuc approved 
in september  the opuc extended our conservation tariff through october weather normalization 
in oregon  the opuc approved our use of a weather normalization mechanism through october this mechanism is designed to help stabilize the collection of fixed costs by adjusting residential and commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather  with rate decreases when the weather is colder than average and rate increases when the weather is warmer than average 
the mechanism is applied to our residential and commercial customers bills between december and may of each heating season 
the mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather  which uses the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
daily average temperatures and year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of degrees fahrenheit for residential customers and degrees fahrenheit for commercial customers see comparison of gas distribution operations  below 
we do not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for our washington customers  which account for about percent of our utility revenues 
regulatory and insurance recovery for environmental costs 
in may  the opuc approved our request to defer unreimbursed environmental costs associated with certain named sites including those described in note beginning in  the opuc authorized us to accrue interest on deferred environmental cost balances  subject to an annual demonstration that we have maximized our insurance recovery or made substantial progress in securing insurance recovery for unrecovered 
table of contents environmental expenses 
through a series of extensions  this authorization has been extended through january  we have requested another extension through january  and that request is currently pending 
see note industrial tariffs 
in august  the opuc and wutc approved tariff changes to the service options for our major industrial customers 
the changes set forth additional parameters that give us more certainty in the level of gas supplies we will need to acquire to serve this customer group 
the parameters include an annual election period  special pricing provisions for out of cycle changes and a requirement that customers on our annual weighted average cost of gas tariff complete the term of their service election 
system integrity program 
in july  the opuc approved specific accounting treatment and cost recovery for our transmission pipeline integrity management program  a program mandated by the pipeline safety improvement act of and the related rules adopted by the us department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration 
we record these costs as either capital expenditures or regulatory assets  accumulate the costs over each months ending september  and recover the costs  subject to audit  through rate changes effective with the annual pga in oregon 
the rate treatment for these costs expired on september  in february  the opuc approved a stipulated agreement to create a new  consolidated system integrity program sip 
the new sip would integrate the older and the proposed programs into a single program 
the sip also includes a component for a proposed distribution integrity management program  which will be implemented following issuance of new federal regulations 
costs will be tracked into rates annually  with recovery to be sought after the first million of capital costs which are our responsibility 
an annual cap for expenditures will be approximately million  with any extraordinary costs above the cap to be approved with written consent of all parties 
the sip applies to costs incurred in oregon during the period from october to october  or until the effective date of new rates adopted in the company s next general rate case 
we do not have any special accounting or rate treatment for pipeline integrity costs incurred in the state of washington 
amr deferral application 
in  we automated the reading of gas meters on approximately one third of our customers meters 
in  we initiated a project to automate the reading of gas meters for our remaining customers 
the capital cost of our amr project is estimated to be million  and in january we filed for approval to defer the costs associated with the amr project 
this request is pending before the opuc 
if the request for deferral accounting is approved  we will then seek approval to recover the deferred costs in our next pga filing 
depreciation study 
in december  the opuc and wutc approved our filed depreciation study and our request to change the amortization of our regulatory asset account balance on pre plant 
these approvals specifically authorized the implementation of new depreciation rates in oregon and washington  with corresponding decrease to customer rates effective january  the new amortization rates on pre plant  with a corresponding increase to customer rates  became effective january  in washington and will be effective november  in oregon 
the implementation of these new rates will have the effect of decreasing depreciation expense and increasing effective income tax expense rates  both of which will be offset by a corresponding change in utility operating revenues 
in addition  in december we filed our depreciation study with ferc requesting approval to apply these same new depreciation rates for our gas storage business assets 
if approved  we expect the new depreciation rates to be effective as of january  our ferc filing is currently pending 

table of contents business segments utility operations our utility margin results are affected by customer growth and to a certain extent by changes in weather and customer consumption patterns  with a significant portion of our earnings being derived from natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers 
in oregon  we have a conservation tariff that adjusts revenues to offset changes in margin resulting from increases or decreases in residential and commercial customer consumption 
we also have a weather normalization mechanism that adjusts customer bills up or down to offset changes in margin resulting from above or below average temperatures during the winter heating season see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
both mechanisms are designed to reduce the volatility of our utility earnings 
compared to total utility margin decreased million or percent in compared to even though residential and commercial customers contributed an additional million to margin in  including the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in increased by percent over last year due to the colder than average weather and percent customer growth 
the major factors contributing to the decline in utility margin were the million swing in our regulatory share of higher gas costs  a million decrease in regulatory adjustments for income taxes paid and a million decrease in margin from industrial customers due to weaker economic conditions 
our weather normalization mechanism offset residential and commercial margin gains by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent colder than average  compared to an offset increased residential and commercial margins of million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent colder than average 
our decoupling mechanism offset million of residential and commercial margin losses in  after adjusting for price elasticity in the annual oregon pga filing  compared to a margin increase of million in compared to total utility margin increased million or percent in compared to with residential and commercial customers contributing an additional million to margin in  including the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
the million decrease in margin from industrial customers in was partially offset by a decrease in other margin adjustments from regulatory deferrals and amortizations and miscellaneous fees 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in were about the same as in an increase in our regulatory share of gas cost savings of million and a regulatory adjustment related to income taxes paid of million also contributed to the increase in margin see regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  and cost of gas sold  below 
our weather normalization mechanism offset residential and commercial margin gains by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent colder than average  compared to an increase of million in added margin for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent warmer than average 
the decoupling mechanism added million to residential and commercial margin in  after adjusting for price elasticity in the annual oregon pga filing  compared to a margin decrease of million in

table of contents residential and commercial sales residential and commercial sales are impacted by customer growth  seasonal weather patterns  energy prices  competition from other energy sources and economic conditions in our service areas 
typically  percent or more of our annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
although variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers  the effect on margin and net income is significantly reduced due to our weather normalization mechanism in oregon where about percent of our customers are served 
beginning in  this mechanism became effective for the period from december through may of each heating season 
approximately percent of our eligible oregon customers have opted out of the mechanism 
in oregon  we also have a conservation decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between our earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by our customers  so that we do not have an incentive to encourage greater consumption contrary to customers energy conservation efforts 
in washington  where the remaining approximately percent of our customers are served  we do not have a weather normalization or a conservation decoupling mechanism 
as a result  we are not fully insulated from earnings volatility due to weather and conservation 
the primary factors that impact results of operations in the residential and commercial markets are customer growth  seasonal weather patterns  competition from other energy sources and economic conditions in our service territory 
compared to operating revenues increased percent due to a percent increase in volumes  partially offset by lower customer rates of to percent over the first months of  volumes were percent higher  primarily reflecting percent customer growth and percent colder weather  and margin was percent higher  reflecting increased volumes from customer growth and from colder weather for customers not covered by weather normalization see cost of gas sold  below 
compared to operating revenues increased percent  primarily due to a percent increase in volumes  volumes were percent higher  primarily reflecting percent customer growth and percent colder weather  and margin before regulatory adjustments for weather normalization  decoupling and income taxes paid was percent higher  reflecting increased volumes from customer growth and higher gas cost savings from our pga incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see cost of gas sold  below 
industrial sales and transportation industrial operating revenues include the commodity cost component of gas sold under sales service but not to transportation service 
therefore  industrial customer switching between sales service and transportation service can cause swings in operating revenues but generally our margins are not affected because we do not mark up the cost of gas 
as such  we believe margin is a better 
table of contents measure of performance for the industrial sector 
the primary factors that impact results of operations in industrial sales and transportation markets are as follows compared to operating revenues decreased million  or percent  due to a transfer of customer volumes from sales service to transportation and to lower sales rates during the first months in  volumes delivered to industrial customers increased million therms  or less than percent  reflecting a reduction in sales volumes of million therms offset by an increase in transportation volumes of million therms  and margin decreased million  or percent  reflecting a shift in margin from higher margins to lower margin rate schedules and from customers that reduced their usage due to the current economic environment  but this decrease was partially offset by a margin gain of million from curtailment charges for use by a small number of industrial customers during cold weather 
compared to operating revenue decreased million  or percent  due to customers transferring from sales service to transportation service where cost of gas is not a component in operating revenues  volumes delivered to industrial customers decreased million therms  or less than percent  reflecting a reduction in sales volumes of million therms offset by an increase in transportation volumes of million therms  and margin decreased percent  reflecting higher volumes under lower margin special contracts 
several large industrial customers transferred from sales service back to transportation service in high natural gas prices can result from time to time in a number of our large industrial customers switching from transportation service  where they arrange for their own supplies through independent third parties  to sales service  where we sell them the gas commodity under regulatory tariffs 
in such cases  our tariff requires us to charge the incremental cost of gas supply incurred to serve those customers 
regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid the oregon legislature passed legislation  effective january   to ensure that regulated utility operations do not collect in rates more money for income taxes than the utility actually pays to taxing authorities 
under this legislation  if we pay less in income taxes than we collect from our oregon utility customers  or if our consolidated taxes paid are less than the taxes we collect from our oregon utility customers  then we are required to record a refund due to our oregon utility customers 
conversely  if we pay more income taxes than we actually collect from our oregon utility customers  as set forth under our most recent general rate case  then we are required to record a surcharge due from our oregon utility customers 
for the tax year  we filed to recover million through a surcharge to our oregon utility customers 
this surcharge was primarily driven by higher income taxes paid on gains from gas cost savings from our pga incentive sharing mechanism in and strong operating results 
the opuc 
table of contents approved our filing  and we collected a total of million  representing a surcharge of million plus accrued interest of million  from customers in june for the tax year  we filed to recover million through a surcharge to our oregon utility customers 
we have reached an agreement in principle with opuc staff and other parties on that surcharge and are in the process of finalizing a stipulation and supporting documentation 
we expect to collect a total of million  representing a surcharge of million plus accrued interest of million 
again  this surcharge was primarily driven by higher income taxes paid on gains from gas cost savings from our pga incentive mechanism in for the tax year  we anticipate that the difference between income taxes paid and the amounts collected in rates will be less than  and in accordance with the rules  we have not recorded any adjustment for this year 
however  in we recognized a combined adjustment for the and tax years of million  based on revised estimates of our and tax surcharges  representing million plus accrued interest of million 
other revenues other revenues include miscellaneous fee income as well as revenue adjustments reflecting deferrals to  or amortizations from  regulatory asset or liability accounts other than deferrals relating to gas costs 
other revenues increased net operating revenues by million in  compared to million in and million in compared to other revenues in were million higher than in primarily due to a million refund to utility customers for the gas storage sharing mechanism revenues  partially offset by a million surcharge for our rate adjustment for income taxes paid 
compared to other revenues in were million higher than in primarily due to a million increase in deferrals under the decoupling mechanism see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above  a million decrease in amortization expense related to the decoupling deferrals from prior periods  a million increase in interstate gas storage credits to customers reflecting higher regulatory sharing of net income from storage operations and a decrease of million in amortization expense related to demand side management deferrals 
cost of gas sold the cost of gas sold includes current gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains and losses from commodity hedges  pipeline demand charges  seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments  regulatory gas cost deferrals and company gas use 
our regulated utility does not generally earn a profit or incur a loss on gas commodity purchases 
the opuc and the wutc require the natural gas commodity cost to be billed to customers at the same cost incurred or expected to be incurred by the utility 
however  under the pga mechanism in oregon  our net income is affected by differences between actual and expected purchased gas costs primarily due to market fluctuations and volatility affecting unhedged purchases see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above 
we use natural gas derivatives  primarily fixed price commodity swaps  under the terms of our financial derivatives policies to help manage our exposure to rising gas prices 
gains and losses from financial hedge contracts are generally included in our pga prices and normally do not impact net income as the hedges are usually percent passed 
table of contents through to customers in annual rate changes  subject to a regulatory prudency review 
however  utility gas hedges entered into after the annual pga filing in oregon may impact net income to the extent of our share of any gain or loss under the pga 
in washington  percent of the actual gas costs  including hedge gains and losses  are passed through in customer rates see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above  and note 
compared to total cost of gas sold increased million or percent  the average cost of gas sold decreased percent from cents per therm in to cents in  primarily reflecting our to percent pga rate decreases effective november  and our to percent increases effective november   and net gains of million were realized from our financial hedges and included in cost of gas sold  compared to million of net losses in compared to total cost of gas sold decreased million or percent  the average cost of gas sold remained at cents per therm  and net losses of million were realized from our financial hedges  compared to million of net losses in for the year ended december   our actual gas costs were higher than the gas costs embedded in rates  while during the same period in and our actual gas costs were significantly lower than gas costs embedded in rates 
the effect on shareholders from the gas cost incentive sharing was a margin gain of million and million in and  respectively  compared to a margin loss of million in for a discussion of the change in our oregon gas cost sharing incentive mechanism  effective november   see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above 
business segments other than utility operations gas storage our gas storage segment primarily consists of the non utility portion of our mist underground storage facility  asset optimization and gill ranch 
in  we earned million  or cents per share  from our gas storage business segment  after regulatory sharing and income taxes 
this compares to net income of million  or cents per share  in and million  or cents per share  in earnings in and were higher than primarily because of increased revenues from additional contract storage and higher margins from optimization services under a contract with an independent energy marketing company 
in oregon  we retain percent of the pre tax income from gas storage services as well as from optimization services when the costs of the capacity being used is not included in utility rates  or percent of the pre tax income from such storage and optimization services when the capacity being used is included in utility rates 
the remaining percent and percent  respectively  are credited to a deferred regulatory account for refund to our core utility customers 
we have a similar sharing

see note consolidated operations operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expenses decreased by million in  or percent  compared to in operations and maintenance expense included additional costs for strategic initiatives 
operations and maintenance expense increased million in  or percent  compared to  also reflecting higher expenditures for strategic initiatives in the following summarizes the major factors that contributed to changes in operations and maintenance expense compared to a million decrease due to additional costs incurred in for strategic initiatives including maintenance projects  training and promotional and safety campaigns  and a million decrease in employee compensation and benefit expense  primarily due to lower bonuses related to lower operating results which affected annual and long term incentives 
partially offsetting the above decreases were a million increase in costs related to serving a growing customer base and increased operating expenses during the december cold weather episode  and a million  or percent  increase in uncollectible expense reflecting higher revenues due to rate increases and sales volume increases

compared to a million increase in property taxes related to a percent increase in utility plant balances  a million increase in regulatory fees based on higher gross operating revenue  and a million increase in other taxes due to an increase in the annual fee to the oregon department of energy 
we have been involved in litigation with the oregon department of revenue odor over whether natural gas inventories and appliance inventories held for resale are required to be taxed as personal property 
in november  the oregon tax court ruled in our favor stating that these inventories were exempt from property tax 
however  the odor appealed the judgment to the oregon supreme court in august if we are successful in this litigation  we would be entitled to a refund of over million for property taxes paid on inventories beginning with the tax year  plus accrued interest 
due to the uncertain outcome of the proceeding  we have not recorded the recovery of property taxes paid on gas inventories or appliance inventories to recognize the potential gain contingency

achieving the target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating 
table of contents requirements are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and have access to capital markets at reasonable costs 
our consolidated capital structure was as follows december  common stock equity long term debt short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt total liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  short term liquidity is provided by cash balances  internal cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes  unsecured credit facilities  including multi year commitments which are primarily used to back up commercial paper see credit agreement  below  an ability to borrow from cash surrender value in company owned life insurance policies  and proceeds from the sale of long term debt 
we use long term debt proceeds to finance capital expenditures and refinance maturing short term or long term debt 
our senior long term debt ratings are aa and a from s p and moody s  respectively  while our short term debt ratings are a and p from s p and moody s  respectively 
the capital markets  including the commercial paper market  have experienced significant volatility and tight credit conditions in recent months  as reflected by increased spreads and limited access to new financing 
as a result of these market conditions  we delayed a planned fourth quarter debt issuance until the first quarter of in lieu of the delayed debt issuance  we entered into two million bilateral bank lines of credit with maturities of one and three months  and borrowed from corporate owned life insurance policies to provide added liquidity 
with our current debt ratings we have been able to issue commercial paper notes at attractive rates and have not had to borrow from our million back up facility 
in the event that we are not able to issue commercial paper or other debt instruments due to market conditions  we expect that our liquidity needs can be met by using cash balances or drawing upon our committed credit facility see credit agreements  below 
we also have a universal shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of secured and unsecured debt or equity securities  market conditions permitting 
in the event that our senior secured long term debt credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade  our counterparties under derivative contracts could require us to post cash  a letter of credit or other form of collateral  which could expose us to additional costs and may trigger significant increases in draws from our borrowing facilities 
based on our current credit ratings  our experience with issuing commercial paper  our current cash reserves  the availability and size of our committed credit facilities and our ability to issue long term debt and equity securities under the universal shelf registration statement  we believe our liquidity is sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements  including the contractual obligations and investing and financing activities discussed below

commercial paper our primary source of short term liquidity is from internal cash flows and the sale of commercial paper notes payable 
in addition to issuing commercial paper to meet seasonal working capital requirements  including the financing of gas inventories and accounts receivable  short term debt may be used to temporarily fund capital requirements 
commercial paper is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
our outstanding commercial paper  which is sold through two commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement  is supported by one or more unsecured revolving credit facilities see credit agreement  below and note 
our commercial paper program did not experience any liquidity disruptions as a result of the recent credit problems that affected issuers of asset backed commercial paper and certain other commercial paper programs 
at december  and we had commercial paper outstanding of million and million  respectively see note 
this year s outstanding balances were higher than last year primarily due to gas cost deferrals associated with higher gas purchases  higher balances in gas inventories and accounts receivable  commodity hedge payments  and delaying the issuance of long term debt 
credit agreements we have a syndicated line of credit for unsecured revolving loans totaling million available and committed for a term expiring on may   with million of that commitment amount extended through may  additionally  we entered into two committed bilateral bank lines of credit totaling million in november  of which million expired december  and million expired february  the lenders under our syndicated and bilateral credit agreements are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of december  as follows lender rating  by category amount committed in s aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa total based on recent conditions in the credit markets  it is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency 
however  based on our current assessment of the lenders creditworthiness  including a review of capital ratios  credit default swap spreads and credit ratings  we believe the risk of lender default is minimal 

table of contents pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement for the syndicated line of credit  we may request maturity extensions for additional one year periods subject to lender approval 
we extended commitments with six of the seven lenders under the syndicated credit agreement  with commitments totaling million  to may  the credit agreement also allows us to request increases in the total commitment amount from time to time  up to a maximum amount of million  and to replace any lenders who decline to extend the terms of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to the applicable total borrowing commitment 
any principal and unpaid interest owed on borrowings under the credit agreement are due and payable on or before the expiration date 
there were no outstanding balances under this credit agreement at december  and the credit agreement also requires us to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of percent or less 
failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
we were in compliance with this covenant at december  and  with our consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of percent  and percent  respectively 
the credit agreement requires that we maintain credit ratings with s p and moody s and notify the lenders of any change in our senior unsecured debt ratings by such rating agencies 
a change in our debt ratings is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement 
however  interest rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreement are tied to debt ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreement when ratings are changed

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity supply risk  commodity price risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and weather risk 
the following describes our exposure to these risks 
commodity supply risk we enter into spot  short term and long term natural gas supply contracts  along with associated pipeline transportation contracts  to manage our commodity supply risk 
historically  we have arranged for physical delivery of an adequate supply of gas  including gas in storage facilities  to meet the expected requirements of our core utility customers 
our gas purchase contracts are primarily index based and subject to monthly re pricing  a strategy that is intended to reflect market price trends during the upcoming year 
our pga mechanisms in oregon and washington provide for the recovery from customers of actual commodity costs  except that  for oregon customers  we currently absorb percent of the higher cost of gas sold  or retain percent of the lower cost  in either case as compared to the annual pga price built into customer rates 
commodity price risk natural gas commodity prices are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion  potential market speculation and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
commodity price financial swap and option contracts financial hedge contracts are used to convert certain natural gas supply contracts from floating prices to fixed or capped prices 
these financial hedge contracts are generally included in our annual pga filing for recovery  subject to a regulatory prudence review 
at december  and  notional amounts under these financial hedge contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
if all of the commodity based financial hedge contracts had been settled on december   a loss of about million would have been realized and recorded to a deferred regulatory account see note 
we monitor the liquidity of our financial hedge contracts 
based on the existing open interest in the contracts held  we believe existing contracts to be liquid 
all of our financial hedge contracts settle by or are extendible to october  the million unrealized loss is an estimate of future cash flows based on forward market prices that are expected to be paid as follows million in the next month period  and million in the following month period 
the amount realized will change based on market prices at the time contract settlements are fixed 
natural gas commodity prices early in the third quarter of were higher than prices embedded in the corresponding pga for unhedged purchases 
to the extent that we purchase gas volumes where the price is not hedged and the current market prices are above those embedded in rates for current customer consumption ie not for storage injections  our earnings are negatively impacted because either to percent of any difference between the actual purchase gas costs and the gas costs embedded in oregon rates are recognized in current income 
in  we recognized a loss of million due to higher gas prices 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including future contractual obligations and maturities of long term and short term debt 
interest rate risk is primarily managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities 
we may also enter into financial derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  options and other hedging instruments  to manage and mitigate interest rate exposure 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge the interest rate on our next long term debt issuance  which was expected to occur in the latter part of however  due to credit market conditions  the swap was extended to the second quarter of this swap is with an a aa rated counterparty and qualifies as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
collectively referred to as sfas no 

the mark to market unrealized loss at december  related to this interest rate swap was million 
holders of certain long term debt have put options that  if exercised  would accelerate maturities by million in see note 
foreign currency risk the costs of certain natural gas commodity supplies and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of the canadian currency in relation to the us currency 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates with respect to purchases of natural gas from canadian suppliers 
at december  and  notional amounts under foreign currency forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
as of december   no foreign currency forward contracts were outstanding with a maturity date after november  if all of the foreign currency forward contracts had been settled on december   a loss of million would have been realized see note 
credit risk credit exposure to suppliers 
certain suppliers that sell us gas have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
to manage this supply risk  we purchase gas from a number of different suppliers at liquid exchange points 
we evaluate and monitor suppliers creditworthiness and maintain the ability to require additional financial assurances  including deposits  letters of credit or surety bonds  in case a supplier defaults 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility would need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher or lower than the original transaction prices 
we believe these costs would be subject to the pga sharing mechanism discussed above 
since most of our commodity supply contracts are priced at the monthly market index price tied to liquid exchange points  and we have significant storage flexibility  we believe that it is unlikely that a supplier default would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties 
based on estimated fair value at december   our credit exposure relating to commodity hedge contracts reflected an amount we owed of million to our finance derivative counterparties 
our financial derivatives policy requires counterparties to have a minimum investment grade credit rating at the time the derivative instrument is entered into  and specific limits on the contract amount and duration based on each counterparty s credit rating 
some counterparties were recently downgraded but continue to maintain investment grade ratings see table below 
due to current market conditions and credit concerns  we 
table of contents continue to enforce strong credit requirements 
we actively monitor our derivative credit exposure and place counterparties on hold for trading purposes or require letters of credit or guarantees as circumstances warrant 
our actual derivative credit exposure  which reflects amounts that financial derivative counterparties owe to us  is under contracts that expire or are expected to settle on or before october  the following table summarizes our credit exposure  based on estimated fair value  and the corresponding counterparty credit ratings 
the table uses credit ratings from s p and moody s  reflecting the higher of the s p or moody s rating or a middle rating if the entity is split rated with more than one rating level difference financial derivative position by credit rating unrealized fair value gain loss thousands dec 
 dec 
 aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa total to mitigate the credit risk of financial derivatives we have master netting arrangements with our counterparties that provide for making or receiving net cash settlements 
generally  transactions of the same type in the same currency that have a settlement on the same day with a single counterparty are netted and a single payment is delivered or received depending on which party is due funds 
additionally we have master contracts in place with each of our derivative counterparties that include provisions for posting or calling for collateral 
generally we can obtain cash or marketable securities as collateral with one day s notice 
we use various collateral management strategies to reduce liquidity risk 
the collateral provisions vary by counterparty but are not expected to result in the significant posting of collateral  if any 
we have performed stress tests on the portfolio and concluded that the liquidity risk from collateral calls is not material 
our derivative credit exposure is primarily with investment grade counterparties rated aa aa or higher 
contracts are diversified across counterparties to reduce credit and liquidity risk 
weather risk we are exposed to weather risk primarily from our regulated utility business 
a large percentage of our utility margin is volume driven  and current rates are based on an assumption of average weather 
in  the opuc approved a weather normalization mechanism for residential and commercial customers 
this mechanism affects customer bills between december through may of each winter heating season  increasing or decreasing the margin component of customers rates to reflect gas usage based on average weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of our utility s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism 
as of december   less than percent of our oregon customers had opted out 
in addition to the oregon customers opting out  our washington residential and commercial customers account for approximately percent of our total customer base and are not covered by weather normalization 
the combination of oregon and washington customers not covered by a weather normalization mechanism is less than percent of all residential and commercial customers
