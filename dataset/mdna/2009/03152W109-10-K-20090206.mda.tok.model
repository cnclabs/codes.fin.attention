item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview amicus therapeutics inc amicus is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel small molecule  orally administered drugs  known as pharmacological chaperones  for the treatment of a range of human genetic diseases 
certain human diseases result from mutations in specific genes that  in many cases  lead to the production of proteins with reduced stability 
proteins with such mutations may not fold into their correct three dimensional shape and are generally referred to as misfolded proteins 
misfolded proteins are often recognized by cells as having defects and  as a result  may be eliminated prior to reaching their intended location in the cell 
the reduced biological activity of these proteins leads to impaired cellular function and ultimately to disease 
our novel approach to the treatment of human genetic diseases consists of using pharmacological chaperones that selectively bind to the target protein  increasing the stability of the protein and helping it fold into the correct three dimensional shape 
this allows proper trafficking of the protein  thereby increasing protein activity  improving cellular function and potentially reducing cell stress 
we are researching the applicability of our platform pharmacological chaperone technology to treat various diseases in our discovery program and developing the use of our lead compounds in our clinical development program 
we completed our phase clinical trials of amigal migalastat hydrochloride and are currently conducting phase clinical trials of plicera isofagomine tartrate and at deoxynojirimycin hcl 
we have generated significant losses to date and expect to continue to generate losses as we continue the clinical development of amigal  plicera and at and conduct research on other programs 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
from our inception in february through december   we have accumulated a deficit of million 
as we have not yet generated commercial sales revenue from any of our product candidates  our losses will continue and are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
although shire will be responsible for a portion of the costs associated with the clinical development of amigal  plicera and at as discussed below  we may need to obtain additional funds to further develop our research and development programs and product candidates 
in june  we completed our initial public offering ipo of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses payable by us 
in connection with the closing of the initial public offering  all of amicus shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding at the time of the offering were automatically converted into  shares of common stock 
collaboration with shire pharmaceuticals ireland ltd 
shire on november   we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with shire 
under the agreement  amicus and shire will jointly develop amicus three lead pharmacological chaperone compounds for lysosomal storage disorders amigal  plicera and at we granted shire the rights to commercialize these products outside the united states us we will retain all rights to our other programs and to develop and commercialize amigal  plicera and at in the us we received an initial  non refundable license fee payment of million from shire in joint development costs toward global approval of the three compounds are being shared as per the collaboration agreement 
in addition  we are eligible to receive  for all three drug product candidates  aggregate potential milestone payments of up to million if certain clinical and regulatory milestones are achieved for all three of the programs  and million in sales based milestones for all three of the programs 
we will also be eligible to receive tiered double digit royalties on net sales of the products which are marketed outside of the us financial operations overview revenue the collaboration agreement with shire became effective in november shire paid us an initial  non refundable license fee of million at that time 
at december   we recognized approximately million of the license fee in collaboration revenue and million of research revenue for reimbursed research and development fees 
the license fee is being recognized as collaboration revenue over the year performance obligation period 
we have not generated any commercial sales revenue since our inception 

table of contents research and development expenses we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with our research activities  payments we make to third party contract research organizations  contract manufacturers  investigative sites  and consultants  technology license costs  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in drug discovery and development  activities relating to regulatory filings and the advancement of our product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent  facility maintenance  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
we have multiple research and development projects ongoing at any one time 
we utilize our internal resources  employees and infrastructure across multiple projects 
we record and maintain information regarding external  out of pocket research and development expenses on a project specific basis 
we expense research and development costs as incurred  including payments made to date under our license agreements 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates 
from our inception in february through december   we have incurred research and development expense in the aggregate of million 
the following table summarizes our principal product development programs  including the related stages of development for each product candidate in development  and the out of pocket  third party expenses incurred with respect to each product candidate in thousands 
period from february  inception to years ended december  december  product candidate third party direct project expenses amigal fabry disease ended phase plicera gaucher disease phase at pompe disease phase total third party direct project expenses other project costs personnel costs other costs total other project costs total research and development costs other project costs are leveraged across multiple clinical and pre clinical projects 
other costs include facility  supply  overhead  and licensing costs that support multiple clinical and preclinical projects 

table of contents the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates 
as a result  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from our product candidates  amigal  plicera  at or any of our other preclinical product candidates 
this uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the conduct  duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of evolving events during clinical development  including the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patients  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the results of our clinical trials  and any mandate by the us food and drug administration fda or other regulatory authority to conduct clinical trials beyond those currently anticipated 
our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties  including the terms and timing of regulatory approvals  and the expense of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights 
we may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials 
we may elect to discontinue  delay or modify clinical trials of some product candidates or focus on others 
a change in the outcome of any of the foregoing variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate 
for example  if the fda or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate  or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials  we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development 
drug development may take several years and millions of dollars in development costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs  including stock based compensation expense  for persons serving in our executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expense includes facility related costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  promotional expenses  costs associated with industry and trade shows  and professional fees for legal services  including patent related expense and accounting services 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we add personnel and are subject to the reporting obligations applicable to public companies 
from our inception in february through december   we spent million on general and administrative expense 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on our capital lease facility 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following discussion represents our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revision of topic sab 
currently  we derive all of our revenues from our collaboration agreement with shire and expect that we will continue to derive all  or at least a substantial portion of our revenues  from collaboration agreements over the next several years 

table of contents collaboration arrangements may contain multiple elements  including up front licensing fees  reimbursement payments for ongoing research and development  payments for achieving research and development and product approval milestones  sales based milestones and royalties based on percentages of net product sales 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides guidance on determining if an arrangement involves a single unit of accounting or separate units of accounting and if the arrangement is determined to have separate units  how to allocate amounts received in the arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
if a collaboration agreement involves a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy and the performance obligation period is determined for the entire arrangement while if separate units of accounting are involved  we determine a revenue recognition policy for each unit 
in november  we entered into a collaboration agreement with shire 
we evaluated the multiple elements of this agreement in accordance with the guidance in eitf and determined that the multiple deliverables did not have value on a stand alone basis and were unable to obtain verifiable objective evidence to determine the fair value of undelivered elements 
as a result  we concluded that there was one single unit of accounting for this collaboration and determined that the period of our performance obligations under the agreement is years 
upon execution of the agreement in november  we received an initial upfront payment of million from shire which is being amortized to collaboration revenue over the period of the performance obligations which is contractually defined at years 
additionally  under the agreement we are entitled to receive reimbursement of up to of research and development costs incurred in the development of the products covered by the agreement 
we recognize revenue for reimbursed research and development costs in accordance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
we will record the revenue associated with these reimbursable amounts to research revenue while the costs associated with these reimbursable amounts will be recorded in research and development expenses 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees owed to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees owed to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees owed to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  fees owed for professional services  and unpaid salaries  wages and benefits 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
under the prospective transition method  compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements on a prospective basis for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based upon the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
options granted prior to january   as a non public company and accounted for using the intrinsic value method  will continue to be expensed over the vesting period 
the fair value of awards expected to vest  as measured at grant date  is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related awards 
under the prospective transition method  results for prior periods are not restated 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of million  million  and million for the years ended  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes information related to stock compensation expense recognized in the income statement in thousands years ended december  stock compensation expense recognized in research and development expense general and administrative expense total stock compensation expense 
table of contents we use the black scholes option pricing model when estimating the value for stock based awards 
the fair value of stock option awards subsequent to december  is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on a blended weighted average of historical information of our stock and the weighted average of historical information of similar public entities for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use a blended weighted average approach using our own historical volatility and other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life was determined according to the sec shortcut approach as described in sab  disclosure about fair value of financial instruments sab  which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury  zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior  as well as a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows years ended december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options years expected annual dividend per share the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted during  and were  and  respectively 
prior to becoming a public company  the exercise prices for options granted were set by our board of directors  based on its determination of the fair market value of our common stock at the time of the grants with input from our management 
the members of our board of directors have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one are non employee directors 
in connection with the ipo  we performed a retrospective determination of fair value for financial reporting purposes of our common stock underlying stock option grants in  and through april  utilizing a combination of valuation methods described in the american institute of certified public accountants technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  the practice aid 
we utilized the same combination of valuation methods to perform contemporaneous valuations of our common stock for each quarter subsequent to march  these assumptions and methods are more fully described in our form s a that was declared effective by the sec in may basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share we calculated net loss per share in accordance with sfas no 
 earnings per share 
we have determined that the series a  b  c  and d redeemable convertible preferred stock represented participating securities in accordance with eitf issue no 
participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
however  because we operate at a loss  and losses are not allocated to the redeemable convertible preferred stock  the two class method does not affect our calculation of earnings per share 
we had a net loss for all periods presented  accordingly  the inclusion of common stock options and warrants would be anti dilutive 
therefore  the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share are the same 
as a result of the ipo in may  all outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock and were no longer outstanding as of december  
table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in computing basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share in thousands except share amounts years ended december  historical numerator net loss deemed dividend accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock net loss attributable to common stockholders denominator weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted dilutive common stock equivalents would include the dilutive effect of convertible securities  common stock options and warrants for common stock equivalents 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for all periods because of their anti dilutive effect 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in representing an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million associated with headcount growth  a million increase in research supplies and a million increase in costs for travel and meetings primarily related to clinical studies  partially offset by a reduction in contract research and manufacturing costs due to the timing of studies and manufacturing campaigns of million 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million associated with headcount growth and million of governance  insurance and compliance costs associated with being a public company  partially offset by a reduction in legal costs reflective of legal expenses associated with the collaboration agreement with shire 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  an increase of million or  from million in due to assets acquired in interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million or was due to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances and the decline in interest rates 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease of million or was due to the decrease in capital lease borrowings 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense was million in representing a decrease of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to a reduction in contract research and manufacturing costs due to the timing of studies of million  partially offset by higher personnel costs of million associated with headcount growth 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million or from million in the variance was primarily attributable to higher personnel costs of million associated with headcount growth and higher professional fees of million related primarily to finalizing the collaboration agreement with shire 

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  an increase of million or  from million in the increase is primarily due to assets acquired in the first nine months of interest income and interest expense 
interest income was million in  compared to million in the increase of million or was due to higher average cash and cash equivalents balances as a result of the issuance of the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  the million of proceeds from the ipo and the receipt of the million upfront licensing payment from shire 
interest expense was million in  compared to million in liquidity and capital resources source of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in we have funded our operations principally with million of proceeds from redeemable convertible preferred stock offerings  million of gross proceeds from our ipo in june and million from the non refundable license fee from the shire collaboration agreement in november the following table summarizes our significant funding sources as of december  approximate amount funding year no 
shares in thousands series a redeemable convertible preferred stock series b redeemable convertible preferred stock series c redeemable convertible preferred stock series d redeemable convertible preferred stock common stock upfront license fee from shire represents gross proceeds 
the series a  b  c and d redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock upon the effectiveness of our ipo 
in addition  in conjunction with the shire collaboration agreement  we received reimbursement of research and development expenditures from the date of the agreement november  through year end of million 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
we invest cash in excess of our immediate requirements with regard to liquidity and capital preservation in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies and money market accounts 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
although we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits  we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
net cash used in and provided by operating activities net cash used by operations for the year ended december  was million due primarily to the net loss for the year ended december  of million and the change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the change in operating assets and liabilities of million was due primarily to deferred revenue related to the collaboration agreement with shire and lower accounts payable and accrued expenses at year end net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million due primarily to the change in operating assets and liabilities of million and the change in fair value of warrant liability of million  offset by the net loss for the year ended december  of million 
the change in operating assets and liabilities of million was due primarily to deferred revenue related to the million upfront licensing payment from shire 
net cash provided by and used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
net cash provided by investing activities reflects million for the sale and redemption of marketable securities  offset by million for the purchase of marketable securities and million for the acquisition of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million 
net cash used in investing activities reflects million for the purchase of marketable securities and million for the acquisition of property and equipment  offset by million for the sale and redemption of marketable securities 

table of contents net cash used in and provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of payments of equipment debt financing obligations of million offset by million proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting primarily of million from the issuance of series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  million from the issuance of common stock  million from asset financing arrangements  and million proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants offset by payments of equipment debt financing obligations of million 
funding requirements we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future primarily due to increasing research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials  and greater general and administrative expenses resulting from expanding our finance and administrative staff  adding infrastructure  and incurring additional costs related to being a public company 
our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials of amigal  plicera and at  the scope  progress  results and costs of preclinical development  laboratory testing and clinical trials for our other product candidates  our achievement of milestone payments under our collaboration agreement with shire  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  and our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone  royalty or other payments from any such collaborators 
we do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from commercial sales for at least the next several years  if at all 
in the absence of additional funding  we expect our continuing operating losses to result in increases in our cash used in operations over the next several quarters and years 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  together with the expected reimbursement of research and development expenses  excluding research milestones  from our collaboration with shire  will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least until financial uncertainties related to potential future payments milestone payments we have acquired rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates through licenses granted by various parties 
while our license agreements for amigal and at do not contain milestone payment obligations  two of these agreements related to plicera do require us to make such payments if certain specified pre commercialization events occur 
upon the satisfaction of certain milestones and assuming successful development of plicera  we may be obligated  under the agreements that we have in place  to make future milestone payments aggregating up to approximately million 
however  such potential milestone payments are subject to many uncertain variables that would cause such payments  if any  to vary in size 
the events that trigger these payments include completion of phase clinical trials  commencement of phase clinical trials  submission of a new drug application nda to the fda or foreign equivalents  and receipt of marketing approval from the fda or foreign equivalents 

table of contents royalties under our license agreements  if we owe royalties on net sales for one of our products to more than one licensor  then we have the right to reduce the royalties owed to one licensor for royalties paid to another 
the amount of royalties to be offset is generally limited in each license and can vary under each agreement 
for amigal and at  we will owe royalties only to mt 
sinai school of medicine mssm 
we expect to pay royalties to all three licensors with respect to plicera 
to date  we have not made any royalty payments on sales of our products and believe we are several years away from selling any products that would require us to make any such royalty payments 
on october   we amended and restated its license agreement with mssm 
the amended and restated agreement consolidated previous amendments into a single agreement  clarified the portion of royalties and milestone payments that we receive from shire that are payable to mssm  and provided us with the sole right to control the prosecution of patent rights described in the amended and restated license agreement 
under the terms of the amended and restated license agreement  we agreed to pay mssm million in connection with the million upfront payment that we received in november  which was already accrued for at year end  and an additional million for the sole right to and control over the prosecution of patent rights 
whether we will be obligated to make milestone or royalty payments in the future is subject to the success of our product development efforts and  accordingly  is inherently uncertain 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 
less than over total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations employment agreement total fixed contractual obligations this table does not include a any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known  b any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts of such payments  timing and or the likelihood of such payments are not known  c amounts  if any  that may be committed in the future to construct additional facilities  and d contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above 
we lease office and laboratory space in cranbury  new jersey 
one of these leases will expire by its terms in august and the other two subleases expire in february in  we leased office and laboratory space in san diego  ca and this lease will expire by its terms in september in august  we entered into capital lease agreements that provide for up to million of equipment financing through august the facility was increased to million in may and to million in november these financing arrangements include interest of approximately  and lease terms of or months 
eligible assets under the lease lines include laboratory and scientific equipment  computer hardware and software  general office equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements 
upon termination of the lease agreements  we may renew the lease or purchase the leased equipment for 
we also have the option to purchase the equipment at set prices before termination of the lease 
the funding period of the facility expired by its own term in on april   we entered into an employment agreement with our president and chief executive officer that provides for an annual base salary  a cash bonus of up to of base salary  an executive medical reimbursement contract  annual reimbursement up to  for medical expenses not covered by the executive medical reimbursement contract or our medical or health insurance policies  and gross up for federal and state income taxes of income tax incurred in connection with medical reimbursement 
the agreement will continue for successive one year terms until either party provides written notice of termination to the other in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
the table above includes costs associated with the remainder of the third one year term and fourth one year term ending april  the cost of the executive medical reimbursement contract is estimated based on current premiums 
we have entered into agreements with clinical research organizations and other outside contractors who will be partially responsible for conducting and monitoring our clinical trials for amigal  plicera and at these contractual obligations are not reflected in the table above because we may terminate them without penalty 

table of contents except for the shire collaboration agreement described above  we have no other lines of credit or other committed sources of capital 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  which specifies that issuers of these instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that reflects the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
fsp no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
fsp no 
is also to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented except if these instruments were not outstanding during any of the periods that are presented in the annual financial statements for the period of adoption but were outstanding during an earlier period 
we do not expect that this will have a significant impact on the financial statements of the company 
in december  the eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
the eitf concluded on the definition of a collaborative arrangement and that revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in eitf and other accounting literature 
based on the nature of the arrangement  payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and its terms  the nature of the entity s business  and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature would be presented 
companies are also required to disclose the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however required disclosure under eitf applies to the entire collaborative agreement 
this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we do not expect that this will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
this statement also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as the non controlling interest in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values 
sfas no 
r makes various other amendments to authoritative literature intended to provide additional guidance or to confirm the guidance in that literature to that provided in this statement 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not expect that this will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas no 
 which amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries not held by the parent to be clearly identified  labeled and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
this statement also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest must be accounted for consistently  and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained non controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary must be initially measured at fair value 
the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any non controlling equity investment 
the statement also requires entities to provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
this statement applies prospectively to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements and applies prospectively for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we do not expect that this will have a significant impact on our financial statements 

table of contents in june  the eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires that non refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed  or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided  the deferred amounts would be recognized as an expense 
this issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and earlier application is not permitted 
this consensus is to be applied prospectively for new contracts entered into on or after the effective date 
the pronouncement did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas no 
permits the company to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal year but early adoption is permitted 
the pronouncement did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the recent and precipitous decline in the market value of certain securities backed by residential mortgage loans has led to a large liquidity crisis affecting the broader us housing market  the financial services industry and global financial markets 
investors holding many of these and related securities have experienced substantial decreases in asset valuations and uncertain secondary market liquidity 
furthermore  credit rating authorities have  in many cases  been slow to respond to the rapid changes in the underlying value of certain securities and pervasive market illiquidity  regarding these securities 
as a result  this credit crisis may have a potential impact on the determination of the fair value of financial instruments or possibly require impairments in the future should the value of certain investments suffer a decline in value which is determined to be other than temporary 
consistent with our investment policy  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we regularly invest excess operating cash in deposits with major financial institutions  money market funds  notes issued by the us government  as well as fixed income investments and us bond funds both of which can be readily purchased and sold using established markets 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we currently do not believe that any change in the market value of fixed income investments in our portfolio is material  nor does it warrant a determination that there was any other than temporary impairment 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates  as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
although we do not believe we have any material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates  we may experience reinvestment risk as fixed income securities mature and are reinvested in securities bearing lower interest rates
