however  sales to the defense aerospace sector more than doubled during higher service segment sales primarily were driven by repair service business in the emea region  some of which was attributable to the aspan acquisition

table of contents change total gross profit product service lower overall and product segment gross profit margins during were driven by the non cash inventory valuation adjustments of approximately  discussed previously and  to a lesser extent  sales mix 
the non cash charges reflect the company s increase in reserve due to the aging of programs and slower overall economic activity 
the company assesses its inventory levels and mix in comparison to current customer programs and sells excess inventory or adjusts reserves to reflect current inventory valuations 
the increase in service segment gross profit margin compared to primarily was due to the positive impact of the aspan acquisition on service business 
the company implemented several cost reduction initiatives during that contributed  and are expected to continue to contribute  to significant savings in labor and facilities costs 
the company continues to believe that results of operations will be positively affected as gross profit margins increase through the organic growth of existing customers and other additional global business 
gross margins will vary from program to program  and the mix of programs will vary from quarter to quarter causing gross margin percentages to vary from quarter to quarter 
consequently  it is difficult to predict quarterly gross margins on future sales

on september   the company entered into an amended and restated loan agreement the agreement with keybank national association keybank  providing for a demand line of credit facility the line with a maximum line of credit of  subject to borrowing base restrictions 
the agreement replaces the prior loan agreement  dated april   between the company and keybank  which provided for an  revolving credit facility the revolving line  and together with the line  the debt 
the change in the amount of the line of credit sufficiently supports the company s future projected operating cash requirements 
the borrowing base is determined as the lesser of  or the sum of of the aggregate amount of eligible receivable accounts  plus of the aggregate amount of eligible inventory  not to exceed  the line is evidenced by a cognovit promissory note demand line of credit made by the company in favor of keybank on september  the line is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company  as provided for in the security agreement entered into between the company and keybank on april  as of december   the maximum available borrowing base on the line was  with unused capacity of  as of december  and  the outstanding balance on the debt was  and  respectively

the company paid interest of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the line is a demand line of credit without a defined term  and the company does not control when the line matures 
the company s ability to maintain access to the line will be dependent not only upon the company s future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial operations  but upon conditions both external and internal to keybank  which may have an impact upon keybank s lending criteria and management of their loan portfolio 
as a result  the company could be forced to seek new financing or capital on a timetable that the company cannot control 
because of this  the company is evaluating financing options  both debt and equity 
there can be no assurance that any new financing options will be at terms as favorable to the company as current terms or acceptable to the company or that the company s future performance will not be affected negatively by changes in the above factors 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the availability of credit generally  and the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of the company s long or short term financial prospects if it incurs future losses or if the level of business activity decreases due to a market downturn 
if keybank is adversely affected by the conditions of the us and global capital markets  it may become unable to fund borrowings under its credit commitment to us  which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow additional funds  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other corporate purposes 
in such a situation  we would pursue other sources of external financing while relying on internal sources of liquidity  including more aggressive management of working capital  various cost containment measures and a continued focus on higher margin business 
additional financing also may be required to support the future growth plans of the company  which include an acquisition strategy that may consist of acquiring companies that are similar to or that complement the company 
the company s acquisition strategy may be financed by the issuance of additional common or preferred stock that has been previously authorized by shareholders 
the issuance of these shares requires approval of the company s board of directors 
the company evaluates acquisition targets based on similar or complementary services as currently provided by the company that will be accretive within one year thereafter 
acquisition targets may provide large oem customer relationships that have a potential for additional business through the product synergies of the combined company which may not be attainable by either company on their own and or bring resources  in terms of people  processes and or systems  that increase the scalability of the combined businesses 
the company does not anticipate any acquisitions in off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements with any obligation under a guarantee contract  a retained or contingent interest in assets or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support for such assets  or any other obligation  including a contingent obligation  under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument or arising out of a variable interest 
during the normal course of business  the company may have numerous outstanding purchase orders with vendors to purchase inventory for use in products that are sold to the company s customers or are used in performing repair services for the company s customers 
the company does not record such orders as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets until the material is placed on a common carrier or delivered to the company s facilities  depending on terms of the arrangement 
the company has no minimum purchase quantity requirements with any of its vendors 
critical accounting policies and recently issued accounting standards the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company s most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill and income taxes 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for judgment in application 
in addition  there are areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
note provides a summary of recently issued accounting standards 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement  delivery has occurred and title  ownership and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for product sales  revenue is recognized upon transference of title to the customer 
for repair sales  revenue is recognized when repair work is completed  and the item is either returned to the customer or returned to a customer owned inventory location in the company s warehouse in accordance with repair terms 
for certain repair and maintenance programs  the customer pays a flat fee that covers multiple periods 
the company recognizes revenue on a pro rata basis over the service period 
for an inventory and logistics management program  revenue is recognized in the month in which services are provided 
for non recurring engineering projects  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
for certain end of life product management service programs  we may purchase inventory components no longer in production that are necessary for the program based on the customer s estimated needs  with the agreement that the customer will purchase any remaining items after an agreed upon period 
the company will carry such inventory for a certain period  and upon completion of that period  the company will sell any remaining inventory to the customer and recognize revenue 
certain customers ask that this inventory remain located at our sites for potential future use in small end of life production runs or in repair programs 
these bill and hold arrangements typically meet the criteria for revenue recognition because they are entered into at the customer s request  they are required due to their business purpose to secure a supply of component parts that will no longer be manufactured  title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  and we physically segregate such components from company owned inventory 
accounts receivable accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
credit is extended based on evaluation of customers financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable payment terms vary 
the company assesses the collectability of accounts receivable and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical write off experience  and an ongoing review of the company s trade customers and their ability to make payment 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history with each customer  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible as determined by a continuous review of the customer s ability to pay 
payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company can provide no assurance that a material adjustment to accounts receivable will not be required in the future 
the company will continue to monitor events and circumstances in future periods to determine whether such an adjustment is warranted 
inventory the carrying values of component parts and finished goods represent the lower of average cost or management s estimate of its net realizable value 
such value is based on forecasts of product orders  repair trade in activity in 
table of contents the ensuing years  and management s knowledge of the current market for component parts and finished goods 
the forecasts of product orders and repair trade in activity are based on historical information  known contracts and management s expertise in computer hardware life cycles 
if demand for the company s products and repair trade in hardware prove to be significantly less than anticipated  the ultimate realizable value of such products could be substantially less than the amount shown on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company can provide no assurance that a material adjustment to inventory will not be required in the future 
the company will continue to monitor events and circumstances in future periods to determine whether such an adjustment is warranted 
goodwill in connection with the acquisition of aspan during  the company recognized the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired as goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
goodwill of a reporting unit also is tested for impairment on an interim basis in addition to the annual evaluation if an event occurs or circumstances change which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment requires several judgments and assumptions to be made to determine the fair value of the reporting units  including the method used to determine fair value  discount rates  and expected levels of revenues and earnings 
the company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill during the third quarter of due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated impairment might have occurred 
the factor deemed by management to have constituted a triggering event was the decrease in the company s stock price relative to the book value of the company 
the company assigned the goodwill acquired in the acquisition of aspan to a reporting unit in the service business segment 
the company estimated fair value using an income approach that compared historical and forecasted revenues and earnings of the reporting unit to the purchase price 
based on the results of the testing  management determined that no impairment had occurred as of the interim test date 
going forward  the company will perform its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter based on third quarter financial information 
the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge to goodwill will not occur in a future period 
the company will continue to monitor events and circumstances in future periods to determine whether additional interim impairment testing is warranted

table of contents the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under this method  the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be fully realized 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various states and foreign countries 
there are no federal or state income tax examinations currently underway for these jurisdictions 
due to the uncertain economic environment and recent operating results  the company reviewed its deferred tax assets as of december  to assess whether  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the company s deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on this analysis  management determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance was not required as of december  the company can provide no assurance that a deferred tax valuation allowance will not be required in the future 
the company will continue to monitor events and circumstances in future periods to determine whether a deferred tax valuation allowance is warranted
