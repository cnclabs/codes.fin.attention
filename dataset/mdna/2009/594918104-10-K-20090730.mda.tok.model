md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements notes 
we generate revenue by developing  manufacturing  licensing  and supporting a wide range of software products and services for many different types of computing devices 
our software products and services include operating systems for personal computers  servers  and intelligent devices  server applications for distributed computing environments  information worker productivity applications  business solutions applications  high performance computing applications  software development tools  and video games 
we provide consulting and product support services  and we train and certify computer system integrators and developers 
we also design and sell hardware  including the xbox video game console  the zune digital music and entertainment device  and peripherals 
online offerings and information are delivered through bing  windows live  office live  our msn portals and channels  and the microsoft online services platform  which includes offerings for businesses  such as microsoft dynamics crm online  exchange hosted services  exchange online  and sharepoint online 
we enable the delivery of online advertising across our broad range of digital media properties and on bing through our proprietary adcenter platform 
our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers 
our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season 
typically  the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately of its annual segment revenues in our second fiscal quarter 
in fiscal year  our revenue was highest in the third quarter due to the recognition of billion of revenue previously deferred from the express upgrade to windows vista and microsoft office technology guarantee programs and pre shipments of windows vista and the microsoft office system 
the technology guarantee programs provided customers who purchased current products with free or discounted rights to windows vista and the microsoft office system when those products became available to consumers 
the unfavorable global economic environment adversely affected our business in fiscal year as consumers and businesses cut back on spending  which reduced pc shipments and it investments 
but because we offer a wide range of products that enable companies to improve productivity and reduce costs  and because we have a strong pipeline of products  including new versions of windows and office planned for release in fiscal year  we believe that microsoft is well positioned to weather the economic downturn 
as the global economy improves  this will create new opportunities to increase revenue 
to further help weather the economic downturn  in fiscal year we made important adjustments to our cost structure and streamlined internal business processes 
technological innovation is the foundation of our long term growth and we intend to maintain our commitment to investment in research and development  engineering excellence  and delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners 
recognizing that one of our primary business objectives is to help accelerate worldwide pc adoption and software upgrades  we continue to advance the functionality  security  and value of windows operating systems 
we remain focused on selling our products in emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software used in those markets 
we also continue to develop innovative software applications and solutions that we believe will enhance information worker productivity  improve communication and collaboration in work groups  aid business intelligence  and streamline processes for small and mid sized businesses 
to sustain growth in the face of competition from other vendors of proprietary and open source software  our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing software that is easiest to deploy and manage  and that is most secure with the lowest total cost of ownership 
in addition  we continue to invest in research and development in existing and new lines of business  including cloud computing  search  online solutions  business solutions  mobile computing  communication  entertainment  page 
table of contents part ii item and other areas that we believe may contribute to our long term growth 
we also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future software products 
we believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth 
this long term focus on investment in research and development has enabled us to lay a foundation for future growth by delivering innovative products  creating opportunities for partners  and improving customer satisfaction 
our focus in fiscal year is to build on this foundation and to continue to execute well in key areas through ongoing innovation on our integrated software platform  by responding effectively to customer and partner needs  and by focusing internally on product excellence  business efficacy  and accountability across the company 
summary of results for fiscal years   and in millions  except percentages and per share amounts percentage change versus percentage change versus revenue operating income diluted earnings per share fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenue declined across most segments primarily driven by weakness in the global pc market and the unfavorable economic environment

primary factors contributing to the decline include the following revenue from windows operating systems declined reflecting pc market weakness  especially pcs sold to businesses  and a decline in the oem premium mix 
revenue from our entertainment and devices division decreased across most lines of business including xbox platform and pc game revenue which declined primarily as a result of decreased revenue per console due to price reductions during the past months  partially offset by increased console sales and xbox live revenue

operating income decreased primarily reflecting decreased revenue 
operating expenses were flat with decreased general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses offset by increased headcount related expenses  cost of revenue  and employee severance charges

the decreased xbox costs reflect the billion charge in fiscal year related to the expansion of our xbox warranty  partially offset by increased xbox product costs reflecting growth in unit console sales 
the diluted earnings per share growth was impacted by the billion xbox charge in fiscal year and share repurchases during fiscal year fiscal year outlook global macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to demand for our software  services  hardware  and online offerings 
while we see the potential for improvement in calendar year  we are unable to predict the actual timing

investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments  including market declines subsequent to the period end 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  among other factors  we evaluate general market conditions  credit quality of debt instrument issuers  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and for equity securities  our intent and ability to hold  or plans to sell  the investment 
for fixed income securities  we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and page 
table of contents part ii item sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
we lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns 
the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet 
collateral and or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 
we use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies  equity prices  interest rates  and credit  to enhance investment returns  and to facilitate portfolio diversification 
gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized in other income expense 
these are generally offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying securities in the investment portfolio and are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year dividends and interest income decreased primarily reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed income investments

net losses on derivatives increased primarily due to losses on equity  commodity  and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared with gains in the prior period 
net losses on foreign currency remeasurements increased due to the strengthening of the us dollar  particularly in the first half of the current fiscal year 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year dividends and interest income decreased reflecting lower interest rates on our fixed income investments and a reduction in the average balance of interest bearing investments owned

page 
table of contents part ii item in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments  such as exchange traded mutual funds  domestic and international equities  us treasuries  and agency securities 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as corporate notes and bonds  foreign government bonds  mortgage backed securities  and certain agency securities 
level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 
a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level or level investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments 
broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available  the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors  or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades 
our broker priced investments are generally labeled as level investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments 
in addition  all of our broker priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments 
our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded 
such controls include model validation  review of key model inputs  analysis of period over period fluctuations  and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 
while we own certain mortgage and asset backed fixed income securities  our portfolio as of june  does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral

fsp fas clarifies the objective and method of fair value measurement even when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for the asset being measured 
fsp fas and fas establishes a new model for measuring other than temporary impairments for debt securities  including establishing criteria for when to recognize a write down through earnings versus other comprehensive income 
fsp fas and apb expands the fair value disclosures required for all financial instruments within the scope of sfas no

we believe the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  impairment of goodwill  accounting for research and development costs  accounting for contingencies  accounting for income taxes  accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting for product warranties 
revenue recognition we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
a portion of the revenue related to windows xp is recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements including  in some cases  free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis 
the amount of revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on the vsoe of fair value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair value method 
unearned revenue due to undelivered elements is recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the related products life cycles 
revenue related to windows vista is not subject to a similar deferral because there are no significant undelivered elements 
however  windows vista revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade option program which started june  the program allows customers who purchase pcs from participating computer makers or retailers with certain versions of windows vista to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of windows at minimal or no cost 
in addition  purchasers of retail packaged windows vista may also qualify for a free or discounted upgrade to the equivalent windows product with participating retailers in participating markets when the product becomes generally available 
accordingly  estimated revenue related to the undelivered windows product is deferred until the product is delivered 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
impairment of investment securities sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  staff accounting bulletin no 
 and fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  provide guidance page 
table of contents part ii item on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  credit quality of debt instrument issuers  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and for equity securities  our intent and ability to hold  or plans to sell  the investment 
for fixed income securities  we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and  if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we changed the date of our annual impairment test from july to may the change was made to more closely align the impairment testing date with our long range planning and forecasting process 
we believe the change in accounting principle related to changing our annual impairment testing date did not delay  accelerate  or avoid an impairment charge 
we have determined that this change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively 
during fiscal year  the annual impairment test was performed as of july  and was performed again as of may  research and development costs we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements  including sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing 
generally  this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 
page 
table of contents part ii item legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations  financial position  or our cash flows 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
under fin no 
 we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 
product warranties we account for product warranties in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
for hardware warranty  we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates  historical and projected repair costs  and knowledge of specific product failures if any 
the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business  but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from days to three years 
for software warranty  we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes  such as security patches  over the life of the software 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary

a portion of these risks is hedged  but they may impact results of operations cash flows and financial condition 
foreign currency 
certain forecasted transactions  assets  and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
interest rate 
our fixed income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed income indices 
in addition  we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage backed securities 
equity 
our equity portfolio consists of global  developed  and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk 
we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
commodity 
we use broad based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification 
our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities  including precious metals  energy  and grain 
we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
value at risk we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  equity prices  and commodity prices  assuming normal market conditions 
the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the percentile confidence level or  alternatively stated  the losses could exceed the var in out of  cases 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  and legal risk 
the following table sets forth the one day var for substantially all of our positions as of june  and and for the year ended june  in millions year ended june  risk categories june  june  average high low foreign currency interest rate equity commodity total one day var for the combined risk categories was million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june   and less at june   than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio
