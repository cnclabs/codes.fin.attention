overview was a year of positive achievements for transact as compared to during  we focused on and delivered sales growth and delivered across the majority of our sales units  both domestically and internationally 
during  we shipped a record  printers  led by record sales of our epic casino printer and significantly higher sales of our online thermal lottery printer 
our sales success was also complemented by improved gross margin  operating margin and earnings per share 
we continue to focus on sales growth in our core markets banking and pos  casino and gaming  lottery  and in our transact services group to drive increased profitability 
during  our total net sales increased by to approximately  see the table below for a breakdown of our sales by market 
year ended year ended change in thousands december  december  banking and pos casino and gaming lottery transact services group total net sales 
table of contents we experienced an increase of approximately in sales of banking and pos printers in sales of our bankjet line of inkjet bank teller printers increased due to incremental sales of our first generation bankjet bank teller printer as well as initial sales of our newly launched  next generation bankjet bank teller printer 
in addition to higher banking printer sales  we also experienced a slight increase in sales from our line of pos printers due primarily to sales of our two new printer products for mcdonalds the ithaca thermal receipt label printer which will be used to print either a receipt at the front counter or a label at the grill station and the ithaca label printer which will be used to print labels for mcdonalds new combined beverage initiative 
sales of our legacy line of pos impact printers  as these printers continue to be replaced by our newer thermal and inkjet printers 
we expect sales of our legacy pos impact printers to continue to decline during  as these printers continue to be replaced by our newer thermal and inkjet printers 
in our casino and gaming market  our focus lies primarily in supplying printers for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks  as well as in other gaming devices that print tickets or receipts  primarily in the united states  europe and australia  as well as in the emerging asian market  including macau 
during  despite a weak domestic casino market  our domestic casino and gaming printer sales increased by from due largely to international game technologies igt awarding us default status as default printer provider  which began in april of internationally  casino and gaming printer sales increased by to million  largely due to sales growth of our off premise gaming printers to europe 
on the lottery side  we continue to hold a leading position based on our long term purchase agreement with lottomatica s gtech corporation gtech  our largest customer and the world s largest provider of lottery terminals  with approximately a market share 
gtech has been our customer since  and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them 
in fact  our contract with gtech continues through currently  we fulfill substantially all of gtech s printer requirements for lottery terminal installations and upgrades worldwide 
during  we experienced a record level of sales compared to historical sales levels from gtech  with total printer sales increasing by approximately  or  compared to however  our sales to gtech each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations gtech performs 
our sales to gtech are not indicative of gtech s overall business or revenue 
our transact services group tsg  which sells service  replacement parts and consumable products  including receipt paper  ribbons and inkjet cartridges  continues to offer a substantial growth opportunity and recurring revenue stream for transact 
even with declining sales of replacement parts for legacy impact printers as the installed base of these printers in the market declines  tsg domestic revenue continued to increase in by from during  our domestic sales benefited from higher inkjet cartridge sales resulting from the previously signed agreement with a leading national office supply chain to supply inkjet cartridges in as well as expanding sales of paper and other consumable products through our e commerce website  transactsupplies 
com 
internationally  tsg sales declined due to the decrease in maintenance and repair services revenue from a service contract with a single customer in the united kingdom 
the service contract  which represented a substantial portion of our uk subsidiary s revenue in  ended in november and was not renewed  as the customer replaced our printers with newer technology that we were unable to provide 
operationally  both our gross margin and operating margin showed marked improvement from during  our gross margin increased to compared to in  due primarily to higher sales volume combined with lower product costs and increased absorption of certain manufacturing overhead expenses as we continue to transfer our domestic  in house production of our products to a lower cost contract manufacturer in china 
our operating margin also increased to in compared to in  as our operating expenses decreased by due to cost reduction programs we put in place at the end of and our sales increased by 
overall  we reported net income of million and net income per share diluted of per share for we also utilized cash during to fund  of capital expenditures and repurchase  of our common stock  and we finished the year with million of cash and no debt on our balance sheet as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances 
those judgments affect both balance sheet items and income statement categories 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  goodwill impairment  warranty obligations  restructuring accruals  share based compensation and contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates 
actual results may differ from the original estimates 
the following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition our typical contracts include the sale of printers  which are sometimes accompanied by separately priced extended warranty contracts 
we also sell spare parts  consumables  and other repair services sometimes pursuant to multi year product maintenance contracts  which are not included in the original printer sale and are ordered by the customer as needed 
we recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within sab  revenue recognition 
specifically  revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery based on shipping terms which are generally fob shipping point has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable  and collectablity is reasonably assured 
we provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition 
revenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to fasb technical bulletin ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
pursuant to ftb  revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period 
we record deferred revenue for advance payments received from customers for maintenance contracts 
our customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns 
we offer some of our customer s price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and we infrequently lower prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have not been material 
however  we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue 
we charge our customers for shipping and handling services 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  or less than of outstanding accounts receivable  which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable 
while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
as of december   we had accounts receivable balances due from two customers of approximately and  respectively  of the total balance due  and no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
as of december   we had accounts receivable balances due from three customers of  and of the total balance due  respectively  and no other customer accounts receivable balance exceeded 
inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we review market value based on historical usage and estimates of future demand 
assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made  as necessary  to reflect changing market conditions 
based on these reviews  inventory write downs are recorded  as necessary  to reflect estimated obsolescence  excess quantities and market value 
should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence  additional write downs of inventory could result in a charge to income 
as of december   our net inventory included a reserve of  or of gross inventory  to write inventory down to lower of cost or market 
goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our last assessment as of december  factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to  at december  and we have determined that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  as well as net operating losses  tax credits and other carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 

table of contents significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years  and match this forecast against the basis differences  deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance or tax reserve  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
in july  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
among other things  fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity s financial statements 
fin requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if  as of the balance sheet reporting date  it is more likely than not ie  more than a likelihood that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits 
when making this assessment  management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information 
the new accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed  or expected to be claimed  on a company s income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin requires significant new and expanded footnote disclosures in all annual periods 
we adopted fin with an effective date of january  retrospective application of fin was prohibited 
as a result of the implementation  we recognized a decrease to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
this decrease was accounted for as a  adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  as of december   we recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately  and a tax reserve of  primarily on portions of certain tax credits 
we will need to recognize approximately million in future taxable income in order to realize all of our deferred tax assets at december  in one of the last three years  we have had us taxable losses and there is no assurance that we will generate future taxable income sufficient to realize all of our deferred tax assets 
however  based on our current projection of future taxable income as of december   no valuation allowance is considered necessary 
should circumstances change and we determine that some or all of the deferred taxes would not be realized  a valuation allowance would be recorded  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
restructuring in february  we announced plans to establish a global engineering and manufacturing center at our ithaca  ny facility 
as part of this strategic decision  we undertook a plan to consolidate all manufacturing and engineering into our existing ithaca  ny facility and close our wallingford  ct manufacturing facility the consolidation 
as of december   we successfully transferred substantially all our wallingford operations to ithaca  ny  with the exception of our corporate headquarters and a service center that remains in connecticut 
the closing of the wallingford manufacturing facility resulted in the termination of employment of approximately production  administrative and management employees 
in connection with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in  we recorded significant accruals 
through december   we recognized approximately million of expenses associated with the consolidation  including severance pay  stay bonuses  employee benefits  moving expenses  non cancelable lease payments  and other costs 
management has made reasonable estimates of such costs and expenses 
during november  we executed an agreement  effective may   to terminate the lease agreement for our wallingford  ct facility 
as a result  we changed our estimate of the restructuring accrual and reversed approximately  of restructuring expenses in during the second quarter of  we recorded an additional  of expense to finalize the termination of the lease agreement 
as of september   all non cancelable lease payments related to our wallingford  ct facility have been made and we do not expect to incur any additional restructuring expenses related to the consolidation 
warranty we generally warrant our products for up to months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded 
estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs 
if actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates  adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made 
contingencies we record an estimated liability related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes pursuant to fas on a quarterly basis  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
if the actual liabilities are settled in an amount greater than those recorded on the balance sheet  a change to income would be recorded 

table of contents share based compensation we calculate share based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r  share based payment as amended using the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of share based awards 
the key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant  and the stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend yield  and forfeiture rate 
the determination of these assumptions is based on past history and future expectations  and is subject to a high level of judgment 
to the extent any of the assumptions were to change from year to year  the fair value of new option grants may vary significantly

we expect the domestic casino and gaming market to continue to be weak into as we believe the current uncertain economic environment is negatively impacting the casino industry s level of capital expenditures 
in light of these negative market conditions  our future sales to the domestic casino and gaming market may be unpredictable and adversely affected 
international casino and gaming printer sales increased  or  to  in compared to international sales represented and of total sales into our casino and gaming market during and  respectively

however  based on our current projection of future taxable income as of december   we believe that it is more likely than not that the existing net deferred tax assets will be realized

this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
fas defines fair value based upon an exit price model 
a fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability  or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
this statement was effective for the company beginning on january   except that fsp delayed the effective date of fas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted fas on january   with the exception of the application of the statement to nonrecurring nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value which include i goodwill impairment testing  ii initial measurement of the fair value of asset retirement obligations and iii measurement of impairment of long lived assets

resource sufficiency we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows generated from operations and borrowings available under the td banknorth credit facility will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs  finance our capital expenditures and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months 
impact of inflation we believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years 
however  inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of certain raw materials  component parts and labor used in the manufacture of our products 
it also may increase our operating expenses  manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets 
despite growing costs of oil  gas and freight over the recent year  we have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent  price increases  and we expect to be able to do the same during as such  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the investment of our available cash and cash equivalents 
in accordance with our investment policy  we strive to achieve above market rates of return in exchange for accepting a prudent amount of incremental risk  which includes the risk of interest rate movements 
risk tolerance is constrained by an overriding objective to preserve capital 
an effective increase or decrease of in interest rates would not have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of our sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results in the future 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we estimate that the combined translational and transactional impact of a overall movement in exchange rates from december  principally the uk pound sterling is approximately  on a pre tax basis
