table of contents we purchased million and million shares of our common stock for million and million during and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates for inventory valuation reserves  insurance liabilities and reserves  asset impairments  reserve for closed stores  reserves against deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation reserves we have established reserves for estimated inventory shrinkage between physical inventories 
distribution centers perform cycle counts encompassing all inventory items at least once every quarter 
stores perform physical inventories at least once a year  and between the physical inventories  stores perform counts on certain inventory items 
most of the stores do not perform physical inventories during the last quarter of the year due to the holiday season  but continue to perform counts on certain inventory items 
as of the end of a reporting period  there will be stores with certain inventory items that have not been counted 
for each reporting period presented  we estimate the inventory shrinkage based on a two year historical trend analysis 
changes in shrink results or market conditions could cause actual results to vary from estimates used to establish the inventory reserves 
we also have reserves for estimated obsolescence and to reduce merchandise inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at their historical cost 
factors included in determining obsolescence reserves include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of merchandise  seasonal trends and decisions to discontinue certain products 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may require additional reserves 
as of february   and february   we had inventory valuation reserves of million and million  respectively 
asset impairments we review long lived assets for impairment in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we conduct this review quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of such assets may not be recoverable 
there were no material asset impairments identified during reserve for closed stores we continuously evaluate the performance of our stores and periodically close those that are under performing 
closed stores are generally replaced by a new store in a nearby location 
we establish reserves for future occupancy payments on closed stores in the period the store is closed  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
these costs are classified in operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
as of february   and february   our reserve for closed stores was million and million  respectively 
we can make no assurances that additional charges for these stores will not be required based on the changing real estate environment 

table of contents insurance liabilities and reserves we maintain standard property and casualty insurance on all our properties and leasehold interests  product liability insurance that covers products and the sale of pets  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability  and workers compensation insurance 
property insurance covers approximately billion in buildings and contents  including furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements  and inventory 
under our casualty and workers compensation insurance policies as of february   we retained an initial risk of loss of million per occurrence for general liability and million per occurrence for workers compensation 
we establish reserves for losses based on periodic actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims  including losses for which claims have been incurred but not reported 
loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events and changes in such assumptions could result in an adjustment to the reserves 
as of february   and february   we had approximately million and million  respectively  in reserves related to casualty  self insured health plans  employer s professional liability  and workers compensation insurance policies 
income taxes we establish deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances at february   and february   were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
as of january   we adopted fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin no 
 the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities 
the determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in any of these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents the percent to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income year ended february  february  january  weeks weeks weeks statement of operations data net sales cost of sales gross profit operating  general and administrative expenses operating income gain on sale of investment interest income interest expense income before income tax expense and equity in income from investee income tax expense equity in income from investee net income weeks compared to weeks net sales net sales increased million  or  to billion in  compared to net sales of billion in the sales increase is primarily due to the addition of net new stores since february   partially offset by the rd week of sales in and a increase in comparable store sales for the rd week in increased net sales by approximately million 
our comparable store sales growth was for the increase in our comparable sales growth rate was due to inflation and pricing strategies  partially offset by economic conditions and a slow down in consumer spending  primarily in our hardgoods category 
services sales  which are included in our net sales amount discussed above and include grooming  training  boarding and day camp  increased by  or million  to million in compared to million in the increase during was primarily due to continued strong demand for our grooming services  the addition of net new stores  and new petshotels  partially offset by the rd week in  which increased services sales by million 
gross profit gross profit decreased to of net sales for from for in  store occupancy costs increased as a percentage of net sales  as we opened net new stores and petshotels 
the increase in store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales is due to the addition of new stores in more expensive regions  as well as higher real property taxes and lower reimbursements from mmih for vet clinic expenses 
warehouse and distribution costs were flat as a percentage of net sales 
we realized cost savings from increased productivity and efficiency across the distribution network due to our new replacement distribution centers in newnan  georgia and reno  nevada  offset by pressure from higher fuel prices during compared to 
table of contents services sales were essentially flat as a percentage of net sales 
we also opened petshotels in compared to in petshotels have higher costs as a percentage of net sales in the first several years 
merchandise margin decreased due to an increase of consumables merchandise sales relative to total net sales 
consumables merchandise sales typically generate a lower gross margin compared to hardgoods merchandise 
macroeconomic conditions  including a decrease in consumer spending  challenged our merchandise margins 
as a result  we have experienced softness in our higher margin hardgoods merchandise sales 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for from for the decrease in operating  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was attributable to various cost savings initiatives  including a new store labor management process  combined with reduced professional fees  renegotiated maintenance and supply contracts  and lower insurance related costs 
these expense decreases were partially offset by higher payroll and benefit costs for additional headcount at our corporate headquarters  and higher stock based compensation expense 
interest income interest income decreased to million for compared to million for  as our investments were limited to short term  highly liquid  money market funds 
cash available for short term investments was lower during compared to primarily due to cash used to partially fund our accelerated share repurchase  or asr  agreement  in august  payments on the revolving line of credit  and the purchase of million shares of our common stock for million during interest expense interest expense  which is primarily related to capital leases  increased to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to continued increases in capital lease obligations 
income tax expense in  the million income tax expense represents an effective tax rate of  compared with income tax expense of million  which represented an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for includes a benefit from the use of capital loss carryforwards to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of mmih non voting shares and benefits from the release of uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and from the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions 
the effective tax rate is calculated by dividing our income tax expense  which includes the income tax expense related to our equity in income from investee  by income before income tax expense and equity in income from investee 
equity in income from investee our equity in income from our investment in mmih was million and million for and  respectively 
weeks compared to weeks net sales net sales increased million  or  to billion in  compared to net sales of billion in the sales increase is primarily due to the addition of net new stores since january   the rd week of sales and a increase in comparable store sales for the rd week increased net sales by approximately million 
our comparable store sales growth was for the decrease in our comparable sales growth 
table of contents rate was due to economic conditions  a slow down in consumer spending and the impact of the recall of certain pet food products during the twenty six weeks ended july   as well as reduced sales of equine products as a result of our decision to exit that product line 
services sales  which are included in our net sales amount discussed above and include grooming  training  boarding and day camp  increased by  or million  to million 
this increase was primarily due to continued strong demand for our grooming and training services  the addition of new petshotels during and the rd week  which increased services sales by million 
gross profit gross profit decreased to of net sales for from for fixed costs in cost of sales  including store occupancy costs and warehouse and distribution costs  increased as a percentage of net sales 
in  we opened net new stores  petshotels and a new distribution center and completed a portion of the store remodel projects 
these investments increased the amount of rent and other occupancy costs and increased depreciation expense 
these additional expenses coupled with a slower growth rate in net sales decreased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
additionally  services sales increased as a percentage of net sales 
services sales generate lower gross margins than merchandise sales as we include service related labor in cost of sales  however  services generate higher operating margins than merchandise sales 
we also opened petshotels in compared to in petshotels have higher costs as a percentage of net sales in the first several years 
these decreases in the gross profit percentages were partially offset by improvements in merchandise margins 
merchandise margins continued to benefit from pricing initiatives  partially offset by a change in product mix 
hardgoods sales  which generally have higher gross margins than consumable merchandise  grew at a slower rate than consumable sales 
in  we entered into a new master operating agreement with mmih that has an initial year term and has resulted in higher license fees 
we charge mmih license fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals and for their portion of utilities costs 
we treat these amounts as a reduction of the retail stores occupancy costs  which are included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
we also charge mmih for its portion of specific operating expenses and treat the reimbursement as a reduction of the stores operating expense 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for from for during  we experienced lower expense for general liability and health insurance compared to due to lower average claims during the year 
the improvements in claim activity resulted in a smaller increase in the actuarial assessments of our required reserves than in the prior year 
in addition  bonus expense decreased in we also recognized million of gift card breakage income in gift card breakage income is recognized based upon historical redemption patterns and represents the balance of gift cards for which we believe the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
during  we obtained sufficient historical redemption data for our gift card program to make a reasonable estimate of the ultimate redemption patterns and breakage rate 
was the first year in which we recognized gift card breakage income 
in addition  expenses decreased in our e commerce business due to the exit of our equine product line 
this business  which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  decreased as a percentage of total sales 
these expense decreases were offset by expenses incurred to exit our equine product line and by higher corporate payroll and other expenses 
the expenses to exit the equine product line included accelerated depreciations of assets  severance and costs to remerchandise the equine sections of our stores 
corporate payroll and other expenses continues to increase as our revenue growth slowed 

table of contents gain on sale of equity investment and equity in income from investee during the thirteen weeks ended april   we sold a portion of our non voting shares in mmih resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in connection with this transaction  we also converted our remaining mmih non voting shares to voting shares 
the increase in voting shares caused us to exceed the significant influence threshold as defined by gaap  which required us to account for our investment in mmih using the equity method of accounting instead of the previously applied cost method in accordance with apb no 
conversion to the equity method of accounting would typically require a restatement of prior years consolidated financial statements for the mmih earnings 
however  since the amounts are not material  we have not restated prior year financial statements 
interest income interest income decreased to million for compared to million for  primarily due to lower average investments in auction rate securities during the year  partially due to our use of available cash to fund a portion of the asr 
as of february   we had no investments in auction rate securities 
interest expense interest expense  which is primarily related to capital leases  increased to million for compared to million for the increase is primarily attributable to continued increases in capital lease obligations and new bank borrowings during to fund a portion of the asr 
income tax expense in  the million income tax expense represents an effective tax rate of  compared with income tax expense of million  which represents an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate is calculated by dividing our income tax expense  which includes the income tax expense related to our equity in income from investee  by income before income tax expense and equity in income from investee 
the effective tax rate for includes a benefit from the use of capital loss carryforwards to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of mmih non voting shares and benefits from the release of uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and from the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions 
the effective tax rate for includes the settlement of an audit with the internal revenue service and tax benefits primarily due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for certain tax positions and additional federal and state tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow global capital and credit markets have recently experienced increased volatility and disruption 
despite this volatility and disruption  we have continued to have full access to our credit facility and to generate operating cash flow sufficient to meet our financing needs 
we believe that our operating cash flow and cash on hand will be adequate to meet our operating  investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we also have access to our million five year revolving credit facility  although there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms 
we finance our operations  new store and petshotel growth  store remodels and other expenditures to support our growth initiatives primarily through cash generated by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  million for and million for included in net cash provided by operating activities for were million of tax benefits from the economic stimulus act of  which provided for an accelerated depreciation deduction for certain qualifying property 
receipts from our sales come from cash  checks and third party debit and credit cards  and therefore provide a significant source of 
table of contents liquidity 
cash is used in operating activities primarily to fund procurement of merchandise inventories and other assets  net of accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  million for and million for the net cash used in consisted primarily of capital expenditures 
capital expenditures consisted primarily of expenditures associated with opening or acquiring new stores  reformatting existing stores  expenditures associated with equipment and computer software in support of our system initiatives  petshotel construction costs  costs to expand our distribution network and other expenditures to support our growth plans and initiatives 
the primary differences between and were cash received from the sale of mmih stock during  cash used to purchase the canadian store locations during  no purchases of short term investments during  and less cash used to purchase property and equipment during net cash used in financing activities was million for  million for and million for the net cash used in consisted primarily of the purchase of treasury stock  payments on capital lease obligations  a decrease in our bank overdraft  payments of cash dividends and net payments from common stock issued under equity incentive plans 
these activities were partially offset by a net increase in our credit facility borrowings and proceeds from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized 
the primary differences between and were lower purchases of treasury stock in  lower proceeds from common stock issued under stock incentive plans  a smaller decrease in bank overdrafts  and lower tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized 
common stock purchase program in june  the board of directors approved a program authorizing the purchase of up to million of our common stock through during  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
in august  the board of directors increased the amount remaining under that share purchase program by million  to bring the share purchase capacity under the program to million and extended the term of the program to august  from january  through june   we purchased million shares of our common stock for million under the million program  completing the program 
in august  the board of directors approved a new program authorizing the purchase of up to million of our common stock through august  on august   we entered into a million asr agreement 
the asr contained provisions that established the minimum and maximum number of shares purchased during its term 
pursuant to the terms of the asr  on august   we paid million to the asr counterparty 
the asr was initially funded with million in cash and million in borrowings under our new credit facility 
we received million shares of common stock between august  and january  which were recorded as treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheets  completing the asr 
during  we purchased million shares of our common stock for million 
as of february   million remained available under the million program 
common stock dividends we presently believe our ability to generate cash allows us to invest in the growth of the business and  at the same time  distribute a quarterly dividend 
our credit facility and letter of credit facility permit us to pay dividends  so long as we are not in default and the payment of dividends would not result in default 
during each of   and  we paid aggregate dividends of per share 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements substantially all our stores are leased facilities 
we opened new stores and closed stores in generally  each new store requires capital expenditures of approximately million for fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements  approximately million for inventory and approximately million for preopening costs 
we expect total capital spending to be approximately to million for  based on our plan to open approximately net new stores and new petshotels  continuing our investment in the development of our 
table of contents information systems  adding to our services capacity with the expansion of certain grooming salons  remodeling or replacing certain store assets and continuing our store refresh program 
our ability to fund our operations and make planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three years in thousands year ended february  february  january  weeks weeks weeks capital expenditures new stores store related projects petshotel information technology supply chain other total capital expenditures includes store remodels  grooming salon expansion  equipment replacement  relocations  and various merchandising projects

approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits  as shown in other  have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin no 
 and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

table of contents approximately million of insurance obligations  as shown in other have been classified as noncurrent liabilities 
we are unable to estimate the specific year to which the obligations will relate beyond letters of credit we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs  capital lease agreements and utilities 
as of february   million was outstanding under our letters of credit 
related party transactions we have an investment in mmih which  through a wholly owned subsidiary  medical management international  inc  operates full service veterinary hospitals inside of our stores 
our investment consists of common and convertible preferred stock 
during the thirteen weeks ended april   we sold a portion of our non voting shares in mmih resulting in a pre tax gain of million 
in connection with this transaction  we also converted our remaining mmih non voting shares to voting shares 
the increase in voting shares caused us to exceed the significant influence threshold as defined by gaap  which required us to account for our investment in mmih using the equity method of accounting instead of the previously applied cost method in accordance with apb no 
as of february   we owned approximately of the voting stock and approximately of the combined voting and non voting stock of mmih 
conversion to the equity method of accounting would typically require a restatement of prior years consolidated financial statements for mmih earnings 
however  because the amounts are not material  we have not restated prior year financial statements 
our equity income from our investment in mmih  which is recorded one month in arrears  was million for we charge mmih license fees for the space used by the veterinary hospitals and for their portion of utilities costs 
we treat these amounts as a reduction of the retail stores occupancy costs  which are included as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
we also charge mmih for its portion of specific operating expenses  and treat the reimbursement as a reduction of the stores operating expense 
in june  we entered into a new master operating agreement with mmih that has an initial year term and was retroactive to february the new agreement includes a change to the calculation of license fees charged to mmih and a provision for mmih to pay their portion of utilities costs 
we recognized license fees  utilities and other cost reimbursements of million and million during and  respectively 
receivables from mmih totaled million and million at february   and february   respectively  and were included in the receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the master operating agreement also includes a provision for the sharing of profits on the sales of therapeutic pet foods sold in all stores with a hospital operated by mmih 
credit facility in august  we replaced our existing million credit facility with a million five year revolving credit facility which expires on august  borrowings under the credit facility are subject to a borrowing base and bear interest  at our option  at a bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
we are subject to fees payable to lenders each quarter at an annual rate of of the unused amount of the credit facility 
the credit facility also gives us the ability to issue letters of credit  which reduce the amount available under the credit facility 
letter of credit issuances under the credit facility are subject to interest payable to the lenders and bear interest of to for standby letters of credit or to for commercial letters of credit 
as of february   we had no borrowings and million in stand by letter of credit issuances under our million five year revolving credit facility 

table of contents we also have a million stand alone letter of credit facility that expires on june  we are subject to fees payable to the lenders each quarter at an annual rate of of the average daily face amount of the letters of credit outstanding during the preceding calendar quarter 
in addition  we are required to maintain a deposit with the lenders equal to the amount of outstanding letters of credit or we may use other approved investments as collateral 
if we use other approved investments as collateral  we must have an amount on deposit which  when multiplied by the advance rate of  is equal to the amount of the outstanding letters of credit under this stand alone letter of credit facility 
as of february   we had no outstanding letters of credit under this stand alone letter of credit facility  no restricted cash and short term investments on deposit with the lenders  and no other approved investments related to this facility 
we issue letters of credit for guarantees provided for insurance programs  capital lease agreements and utilities 
the credit facility and letter of credit facility permit the payment of dividends  so long as we are not in default and the payment of dividends would not result in default of the credit facility and stand alone letter of credit facility 
as of february   we were in compliance with the terms and covenants of our credit facility and letter of credit facility 
the credit facility and letter of credit facility are secured by substantially all our personal property assets  our wholly owned subsidiaries and certain real property 
seasonality and inflation our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
we typically realize a higher portion of our net sales and operating profits during the fourth quarter 
as a result of this seasonality  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
controllable expenses could fluctuate from quarter to quarter in a year 
since our stores typically draw customers from a large trade area  sales also may be impacted by adverse weather or travel conditions  which are more prevalent during certain seasons of the year 
as a result of our expansion plans  the timing of new store and petshotel openings and related preopening costs  the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores and petshotels and the timing and estimated obligations of store closures  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate 
finally  because new stores tend to experience higher payroll  advertising and other store level expenses as a percentage of sales than mature stores  new store openings will also contribute to lower store operating margins until these stores become established 
we expense preopening costs associated with each new location as the costs are incurred 
while we have experienced inflationary pressure in  we have been able to largely mitigate the effect by increasing retail prices accordingly 
although neither inflation nor deflation has had a material impact on net operating results  we can make no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business 
such risk is principally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations  as well as changes in our credit standing 
in addition  a market risk is associated with fuel prices 
recent developments in the global capital and credit markets  however  have rendered risks less predictable 
energy costs increased fuel prices have negatively impacted our results of operations during the first half of offsetting the increase in fuel prices was a decrease in average miles driven per store as a result of our new distributions center in newnan  georgia and reno  nevada and better truck space utilization 
our results will be negatively impacted if energy prices increase in the future 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary operates stores and uses the canadian dollar as the functional currency and the united states dollar as the reporting currency 
we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
net sales in canada  denominated in united states dollars  were million  or  of our consolidated net sales for transaction gains and losses denominated in the united states dollar are recorded in cost of sales or operating  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income depending on the nature of the underlying transaction 
net exchange gains and losses were not material in  and interest rate risk we have the ability to use a revolving line of credit and short term bank borrowings to support seasonal working capital needs and to finance capital requirements of the business 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
therefore  we have exposure to changes in interest rates 
during  we borrowed million as needed to support seasonal working capital needs 
as of february   there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
we had million of borrowings under the line of credit during to partially fund our asr  in addition to occasional borrowings as needed to support seasonal working capital needs
