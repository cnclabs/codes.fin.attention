item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of our discussion is forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties 
for information regarding factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business  refer to risk factors under the description of business section above 
overview zion oil is an initial stage oil and gas exploration company with a history of almost nine years of oil and gas exploration in israel 
we have no revenues or operating income and we are classified as an exploration stage company 
we currently hold two exploration licenses covering approximately  acres onshore in the state of israel between netanya in the south and haifa in the north 
the areas have been subject to a series of exploration permits and licenses that have been granted to and held by us pursuant to the petroleum law 
we anticipate that we will drill the ma anit rehoboth to an initial depth of about  feet targeted to a bottom hole location in the triassic formation approximately  feet east northeast of the bottom hole location of our previously drilled well in order to appraise our findings in the previously drilled well 
toward that end  on september   we signed a drilling contract with aladdin  pursuant to which we will be utilizing aladdin s  horsepower rig in our drilling 
aladdin is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company  incorporated in delaware  with offices in wichita  kansas and operational headquarters in ankara  turkey 
we have been advised by aladdin that the rig is ready for transport to israel 
we anticipate that the rig will arrive in israel and clear customs in april aladdin is in the process of procuring certain routine permits from the israel ministry of interior needed for the issuance of visas to its rig crew 
after clearing customs in haifa  aladdin will require approximately two weeks in which to rig up ie  erect the drilling rig 
no assurance can  however  be provided as to the exact arrival date of the rig and how long it will take to obtain the remaining permits  rig up and commence drilling operations 
between october  and december   we raised from the follow on public offering gross proceeds of  including  from debt conversion 
in january  we raised an additional  including  from debt conversion and approximately  from settlement of fees due to two service providers 
gross proceeds from the offering were  with the company receiving net cash proceeds of  after deducting for commissions and expenses to the underwriter in the amount of  and the deduction of  in deferred offering costs related to legal  accounting  transfer agent and escrow fees and printing and marketing costs 
we issued  in respect of the amounts raised   units  for cash and  for debt conversions 
see business recent corporate developments completed follow on public offering 
we are utilizing the amounts raised in the follow on public offering to drill the ma anit rehoboth well to the targeted initial depth 
we ultimately intend to deepen the ma anit rehoboth well to a depth of about  feet to both appraise the apparent findings of the ma anit in the triassic at a depth of between approximately  and  feet and to test the deeper permian horizons at a depth of between approximately  and  feet 
estimated dry hole drilling costs are between  and  with completed costs of between  and  however  in order to deepen the ma anit rehoboth well and conduct these tests  we will need to raise at least  additional capital 
we would also need to raise an additional  for completion of the well and production facilities 
accordingly  on january   we filed a registration statement with the sec with respect to a proposed rights offering to common stockholder of up to million shares of our common stock 
each whole subscription right will entitle the holder to purchase one share of our common stock for 
under the proposed offering  stockholders will receive subscription rights for each share of common stock owned on the record date  subject to adjustment as contemplated by the terms of the proposed rights offering 
should the offering be fully subscribed  we expect to receive gross proceeds of million 
proceeds from this offering  if any  would be used for the drilling of the ma anit rehoboth  as well as drilling the elijah  which is estimated to be between  and  for dry hole drilling costs 
of course  no assurance can be provided that we will be able to raise any funds from the proposed rights offering  or that the terms of the proposed rights offering won t change before being declared effective 
as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  the registration statement has not been declared effective  nor can any assurance be given that it will be declared effective 
if we are not able to raise the needed funds from the rights offering  or are otherwise unable to raise funds from alternate sources  then we will drill to the triassic and evaluate our findings within that zone 
due to the recent turmoil in the financial and equity trading markets which coincided with our follow on public offering  we raised significantly less from our follow on public offering which ended on january  than we anticipated 
at this stage of our corporate development  management believes that the most realistic way for us to raise additional capital is through a sale of our securities to third party investors 
under the present conditions in the markets  we believe that any such sale of our securities would need to be at a discount to the market price of our stock 
accordingly  our board decided that before attempting to raise additional funds from outside third parties we would undertake this rights offering and first give our current stockholders the opportunity to participate in our capital raising efforts and maintain their respective proportional ownership interest in us 
if the current trend in declining oil prices  which began in august  continues or is sustained during the period in which we are drilling  then we anticipate that our drilling related costs under our agreement with aladdin may be significantly less than anticipated 
the  horsepower rig that we have contracted for in our drilling is powered by diesel fuel 
we anticipate that once we commence drilling the ma anit rehoboth  it will require approximately days to reach the initial targeted triassic depths 
then assuming we have raised the additional funds needed to continue drilling deeper  we estimate that from that point  it will take an additional days to reach the ultimate permian target depth 
no assurance can of course be provided that the trend in declining oil prices will continue or be sustained for the duration of our drilling 
going concern basis our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
since we are in the development stage  we have limited capital resources  no revenue to date and a loss from operations 
the appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing or equity capital and  ultimately  to achieve profitable operations 
the uncertainty of these conditions in the past has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized 
based upon the encouraging but inconclusive results of the drilling and testing of the ma anit  our oil and gas operations represent an investment in an unproved property including additional drilling on that property 
these costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is charged to expense as a reserve base has not yet been established 
an impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in june  following the analysis of the results of the testing of our ma anit well workover  evaluation of the mechanical condition of the well and the desire to optimize drilling operations on our planned ma anit rehoboth well  we decided to cease operations on the ma anit well and  as required by the petroleum law  formally relinquish the ma anit joseph license 
it is our current intent to use the ma anit wellbore  down to approximately  meters  as the upper part of the wellbore for the planned ma anit rehoboth well 
we plan to directionally drill this well from that point to penetrate the middle and the lower triassic  which we still consider highly prospective by the company 
in addition  assuming we can raise additional funds or obtain additional financing  we intend to drill down to the permian section of the upper paleozoic formation 
immediately after the relinquishment of the ma anit joseph license  we filed an application with the petroleum commissioner for a petroleum exploration license  the joseph license  covering approximately  acres of the original ma anit joseph license including the ma anit structure on which the ma anit well was drilled 
this license was subsequently granted 
as a result of the abandonment of the ma anit well and formal relinquishment of the ma anit joseph license  during  we recorded an impairment of  to our unproved oil and gas properties 
although both our properties and our principal operations are in israel  we report all our transactions in united states dollars 
certain of the dollar amounts in the financial statements may represent the dollar equivalent of other currencies 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe  is likely to be realized in the future 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance we have considered not only future taxable income but also feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in the event that we were to determine that it would be likely that we would  in the future  realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made 
in the period that such a determination was made  the adjustment to the deferred tax asset would produce an increase in our net income 
we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing 
in addition  we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments 
we record a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue 
we have no revenue generating operations as we are still an exploration stage company 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the relatively higher general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to the recording in of an impairment charge of  salary expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in salary expenses are attributable to the addition to our payroll of senior management personnel who were previously retained on a consulting basis 
legal and professional fees decreased to  for as compared to  for this decrease is primarily related to increasing the legal review performed in house as opposed to being performed by external parties 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was  compared to  for this increase is primarily attributable to increased investor relations activities during the period 
interest income  net 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income  net is attributable to the declining bank balances as funds raised from the ipo have been expended 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  at december  and  at december  the decrease in working capital is mainly attributable to the purchase of a great amount of well related equipment during  including paying approximately  for drill pipe during the th quarter 
net cash provided by financing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which the substantial majority was from the sale of equity securities  net of equity sales costs 
net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  substantially all of which was used for exploration costs on the ma anit joseph reissued as the joseph license and the asher menashe license and purchasing equipment to be used in the ma anit rehoboth and other future wells 
net cash used in operations was  for the year ended december   only slightly reduced from  for the year ended december   due to normal economic fluctuations 
on december   we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of as noted previously  between october  and december   we raised from the follow on public offering  of which  was for debt conversion 
in january  we raised an additional  of which  was for debt conversion and approximately  was in settlement of fees due to two service providers 
gross proceeds of  were raised in the follow on public offering  from which net cash proceeds of  were received by the company after deducting for commissions and expenses to the underwriter in the amount of  and the deduction of  in deferred offering costs related to legal  accounting  transfer agent and escrow fees and printing and marketing costs 
as of december   our officers and employees collectively  the deferring officers and employees have voluntarily committed to defer payment of approximately  adjusting for debt conversions made in the final closing of the follow on public offering of unpaid compensation that accrued through december  to july   subject to partial earlier payment in certain circumstances 
the deferring officers and employees are continuing to defer significant portions of their compensation  generally at the rate of of their base salary  though that rate can be greater or less depending on the specific officer or employee involved 
while we believe that the deferring officers and employees will continue to defer all or part of the monies due them beyond july  and until such time as we have sufficient funds to drill the ma anit rehoboth to the permian formation  there can be no certainty of this 
we believe that net proceeds from the follow on public offering which ended on january  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our needs in carrying out our plans into june as noted above  on january  we filed a registration statement with the sec  relating to a proposed rights offering to our shareholders 
the proposed rights offering can be commenced only following the effectiveness of the registration statement and  as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  the registration statement has not been declared effective 
no assurance can be provided as to when  if ever  such registration statement is declared effective or  even if declared effective  that we will be successful in raising any funds through the proposed rights offering 
in the event we do not succeed in raising the necessary amounts from the proposed rights offering  we will have to attract additional investments in our company or additional parties to join our drilling operations in order to carry out our drilling operations beyond june  and the deferring officers and employees must continue to defer the monies due them beyond july  and continue to accept partial payment of their currently due salaries 
there can be no guarantees that we will be successful in any of these efforts
