item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis is included to provide the shareholders with an expanded narrative of our results of operations  changes in financial condition  liquidity  and capital adequacy 
this narrative should be reviewed in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
since our primary asset is our wholly owned subsidiary  oceanside bank  most of the discussion and analysis relates to oceanside 
overview how we earn income 
as stated elsewhere herein  our results of operations are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of oceanside 
oceanside conducts commercial banking business consisting of attracting deposits from the general public and applying those funds to the origination of commercial  consumer  and real estate loans including commercial loans collateralized by real estate 
profitability depends primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from interest earning assets ie  loans and investments less the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities ie  customer deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and is dependent upon oceanside s interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the factors that influence net interest income include changes in interest rates and changes in the volume and mix of assets and liability balances 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows  and loan demand 
additionally  and to a lesser extent  oceanside s profitability is affected by such factors as the level of noninterest income and expenses  the provision for loan losses  and the effective tax rate 
noninterest income consists primarily of service fees on deposit accounts and mortgage banking operations 
noninterest expense consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing costs  and other operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the holding company and the bank 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the accounting and reporting policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of these accounting policies do not require our management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
however  we believe the allowance for loan losses and the valuations of foreclosed assets are critical estimates 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable or incurred credit losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed that is  a confirmed loss exists 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful impaired 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current trends 
loans are individually evaluated for impairment  if significant 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral and accrual of interest is discontinued 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  and prevailing economic conditions 
there is no precise method of predicting specific loan losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off 
also  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates 
table of contents that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
the determination that a loan may be uncollectible  in whole or in part  is a matter of judgment 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses can be determined only on a judgmental basis  after full review  including  consideration of economic conditions and their effect on particular industries and specific borrowers  a review of borrowers financial data  together with industry data  their competitive situation  the borrowers management capabilities and other factors  a continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio  including monitoring any loans that are identified as being of less than acceptable quality  a detailed analysis  on a quarterly basis  of all impaired loans  and an evaluation of the underlying collateral for secured lending 
we maintain a formalized loan review process supported by a credit analysis and control system 
we intend to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to absorb estimated uncollectible loans and  expect to make periodic additions to the allowance for loan losses  when warranted 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed assets 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates that may be affected by significant changes in the economic environment and market conditions 
in connection with the determination of the estimated losses on loans and to support the carrying value of foreclosed assets  we obtain independent appraisals for significant collateral 
our loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral including real property  consumer assets  and business assets 
although we have a diversified loan portfolio  a substantial portion of our debtors ability to honor their contracts is dependent on local  state  and national economic conditions that may affect the value of the underlying collateral or the income of the debtor 
while we use available information to recognize losses on loans  further reductions in the carrying amounts of loans or foreclosed assets may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the estimated losses on loans and the carrying value of foreclosed assets 
such agencies may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
interest rate risk 
our asset base is exposed to risk including the risk resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in the timing of cash flows 
management monitors the effect of such risks by considering the mismatch of the maturities of our assets and liabilities in the current interest rate environment and the sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates 
we have considered the effect of significant increases and decreases in interest rates and believe such changes  if they occurred  would be manageable and would not affect our ability to hold assets as planned 
however  we are exposed to significant market risk in the event of significant and prolonged interest rate changes 
regulatory environment 
we are subject to regulations of certain federal and state agencies and  accordingly  are periodically examined by those regulatory authorities 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities  our business is particularly susceptible to being affected by federal and state legislation and regulations

management s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest income and classify a loan as nonaccrual when principal or interest is past due days or more and the loan is not adequately collateralized  or when in the opinion of management  principal or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the obligation 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance 
consumer installment loans are generally charged off after days of delinquency unless adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
loans are not returned to accrual status until principal and interest payments are brought current and future payments appear reasonably certain 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure  or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  is classified as other real estate owned 
other real estate owned is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs  and the estimated loss  if any  is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time the loan is transferred to other real estate owned 
further allowances for losses in other real estate owned are recorded at the time management believes additional deterioration in value has occurred 
gains or losses on the sale of other real estate owned are recognized in the period closed 
however  gains on the sale of units in a real estate development project may be deferred until management is reasonably certain that its investment in the remaining units will not result in losses 
in  oceanside sold units of a condominium development project with net proceeds exceeding the current carrying value of those units by approximately  no gain was recorded on the sale of these units during during  oceanside reduced its carrying value on this project and other real estate owned with a charge to earnings of  which has been included in noninterest expenses 
management has adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas no 
 which considers a loan to be impaired if it is probable that all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
if a loan is considered impaired  its value generally should be measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  however  the loan s value may be based on the loan s market price  or the discounted fair value of the loan s collateral  less estimated costs to sell  if the collateral is expected to be the sole source of repayment 
if the value of the loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a loss should be recognized by recording a valuation allowance and a corresponding increase to the provision for loan losses 
situations may occur where we receive physical possession of a debtor s assets regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings have been initiated or completed  or the debtor has effectively surrendered control of the underlying collateral in contemplation of foreclosure

many of the loans risk rated substandard are currently performing with no expectation that we will suffer any loss  however  we monitor these loans because many of them are collateral dependent and the current status of the borrower s liquidity and cash flow have not been confirmed

if so desired  we can adjust the rates and terms on certificates of deposit and other deposit accounts to attract deposits and fund additional commitments 
other alternative funding sources include additional fhlb and federal reserve borrowings and brokered deposits  if necessary 
capital resources we place a significant emphasis on maintaining a strong capital base 
the capital resources consist of two major components of regulatory capital  stockholders equity and the allowance for loan losses 
current capital guidelines issued by federal regulatory authorities require a company to meet minimum risk based capital ratios in an effort to make regulatory capital more responsive to the risk exposure related to a company s on and off balance sheet items 
risk based capital guidelines re define the components of capital  categorize assets into risk classes  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the components of risk based capital are segregated as tier and total risk based capital 
tier capital is composed of total stockholders equity reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets 
total risk based capital includes tier capital plus the allowance for loan losses and any qualifying debt obligations 
regulators also have adopted minimum requirements of of tier capital and of risk adjusted assets in total capital 

table of contents we are also subject to leverage capital requirements 
this requirement compares capital using the definition of tier capital to balance sheet assets and is intended to supplement the risk based capital ratio in measuring capital adequacy 
the guidelines set a minimum leverage ratio of for depository institutions that are highly rated in terms of safety and soundness  and which are not experiencing or anticipating any significant growth 
other depository institutions are expected to maintain capital levels of at least or above the minimum 
our actual capital amounts  capital ratios  and leverage ratios at december    and bank only  are reflected in the table below

on september   atlantic entered into a transaction commonly referred to as trust preferred securities 
subject to percentage limitations  the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities are considered tier capital for regulatory purposes  which totaled million net of atlantic s investment in the unconsolidated subsidiary 
however  as a result of the issuance of fin and fin r  the trust subsidiary is not consolidated in these financial statements  and therefore the proceeds received by atlantic from the trust subsidiary is reported as junior subordinated debentures 
in  the federal reserve board ruled that  notwithstanding the deconsolidation of such trusts  junior subordinated debentures  such as those issued by atlantic  may continue to constitute up to of a bank holding company s tier capital  subject to certain new limitations  which will not become effective until march   and which  in any event  are not expected to affect the treatment of atlantic s junior subordinated debentures as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
capital analysis for the year ended december  average equity as a percentage of average assets equity to total assets at end of year return on average equity return on average assets noninterest expenses to average assets 
table of contents stockholders equity is adjusted for the effect of unrealized appreciation or depreciation  net of tax  on securities classified as available for sale 
stockholders equity decreased  in and increased  and  in and  respectively  as follows dollars in thousands net income loss change in unrealized gains losses on available for sale securities implementation of eitf for indexed retirement plan return on average equity the decrease in return on average equity in and is the result of the net loss in and lower earnings for due to higher cost of funds resulting from increased competition for deposits and the increased allowances for loan losses to reflect higher nonperforming loans and lower collateral values particularly in the real estate market in which we operate 
related party transactions we have entered into transactions with our directors  executive officers  significant stockholders  and their affiliates insiders 
such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms and conditions  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the same time for comparable transactions with other customers  and did not  in the opinion of management  involve more than normal credit risk or present other unfavorable features 
the following table summarizes the significant end of period insider transactions dollars in millions loans unfunded loan commitments deposits and customer repurchase agreements interest rate sensitivity our operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  mature  or reprice in specified periods 
the principal objective of asset liability management activities is to provide consistently higher levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and facilitating our funding needs 
we utilize an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present 
the traditional maturity gap analysis  which reflects the volume difference between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities during a given time period  is reviewed regularly by management 
a positive gap occurs when the amount of interest sensitive assets exceeds interest sensitive liabilities 
this position would contribute positively to net income in a rising interest rate environment 
conversely  if the balance sheet has more liabilities repricing than assets  the balance sheet is liability sensitive or negatively gapped 
we continue to monitor sensitivity in order to avoid overexposure to changing interest rates 
our operations do not subject us to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
also  we do not use interest rate swaps  caps  or other hedging transactions 
our overall sensitivity to interest rate risk is low due to our non complex balance sheet 
we have implemented several strategies to manage interest rate risk that include originating residential mortgages for third party lenders  increasing the volume of variable rate commercial loans  requiring interest rate calls on commercial loans  and maintaining a short repricing maturity for a significant portion of our investment portfolio
