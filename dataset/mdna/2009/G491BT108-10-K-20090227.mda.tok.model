global equity markets declined in the three months and year ended december   and continued to fall during the month of january  as illustrated in the table below index three months ended december  year ended december  month ended january  dow jones industrial average s p nasdaq composite index s p tsx composite canada ftse ftse world europe china se shanghai composite nikkei lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was an extremely challenging period in the financial markets 
the financial crisis began in with the subprime mortgage collapse that continued into financial institutions that held mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets took a series of write downs that led to lower market liquidity and the collapse or consolidation of several major financial firms 
heightened risk perceptions ultimately led to systematic deleveraging across the global markets as investors moved out of risky assets 
events in these periods were dominated by challenges in the credit markets 
many financial institutions had difficulty securing short term funding as liquidity rapidly contracted 
with banks unable to obtain funding and reluctant to lend  interbank rates rose both absolutely and relative to central bank policy rates 
government bonds benefited from a flight to quality  particularly short dated issues 
this also led to a strengthening of the us dollar from july until november as us investors unwound carry trades and repatriated funds  and non us investors increasingly purchased non us government issues 
further  credit spreads widened sharply  particularly for financials  and economic growth around the world slowed under the impact of the credit squeeze 
global manufacturing orders slumped as business and consumer confidence waned 
emerging markets saw weakening demand for both exported goods and commodities 
asian markets also experienced lower export demand with concerns about inflation becoming secondary to economic growth 
several major global market indices declined by historic amounts the dow jones industrial average saw its worst year since  the s p had its worst year since  japan s nikkei average saw its biggest decline ever  and the ftse s decline ranks as its worst year since it was created in in response to the market disruptions  governments and central banks have acted to help revive credit markets and restore stability in the financial system 
these actions include direct and indirect support of financial institutions  the imposition of short selling restrictions  easing of monetary policy  and the guaranteeing of certain financial instruments 
the us federal reserve cut the federal funds rate target seven times during  from at the beginning of the year to setting a target rate of to in december  a historic low 
despite these actions  the equity and credit markets continue to operate under considerable pressure 
a significant portion of our business and managed aum are based outside of the us the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies  primarily the pound sterling and the canadian dollar  will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period 
additionally  our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our aum 
therefore  movements in global capital market levels  net new business inflows or outflows and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period 
the returns from most global capital markets declined in the three months and year ended december   which contributed to declines in aum of billion and billion during the respective periods 
assuming a continuation of year end market and foreign exchange levels  invesco expects to decrease total operating expenses by million  or  to  million from  million in this reduction is comprised of three components of the reduction is expected to be realized from decreases in third party distribution  service and advisory expenses  which naturally decline with aum levels  of the reduction is expected to be realized from decreases in employee compensation expenses  and of the reduction is expected to be realized from declines in other expenses  including general and administrative  marketing and property  office and technology expenses 
as part of the million expense reduction  we expect million in savings to be generated from our continued movement towards global operating platforms  further use of our low cost enterprise centers  managing discretionary spending  continued leverage of our centers of expertise on a global basis  and managing our staff expenses 
we will also continue to reinvest in our business in  targeting million of incremental cost which is included in the million total reduction in versus  including investments in our private equity business  exchange traded funds  common technology platforms  and building out our institutional sales and client service group 
we expect to incur transition expenses of approximately million also included in the million in order to achieve the planned savings

results of operations results of operations for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  operating revenues and net revenues operating revenues decreased by in to  million  million

net revenues decreased by in to  million  million 
see schedule of non gaap information for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues 
the main categories of revenues  and the dollar and percentage change between the periods  are as follows in millions change change investment management fees performance fees service and distribution fees other total operating revenues third party distribution  service and advisory expenses proportional share of revenues  net of third party distribution expenses  from joint venture investments net revenues investment management fees investment management fees are derived from providing professional services to manage client accounts and include fees received from retail mutual funds  unit trusts  investment companies with variable capital icvcs  exchange traded funds  investment trusts and institutional and private wealth management advisory contracts 
investment management fees for products offered in the retail distribution channel are generally calculated as a percentage of the daily average asset balances and therefore vary as the levels of aum change resulting from inflows  outflows and market movements 
investment management fees for products offered in the institutional and private wealth management distribution channels are calculated in accordance with the underlying investment management contracts and also vary in relation to the level of client assets managed 
investment management fees decreased in to  million  million due to decreases in average aum during the year and the mix of aum between various asset classes 
average aum for the year ended december   were billion billion  a decrease of 
average long term aum  which generally earn higher fee rates than institutional money market aum  for the year ended december   were billion  a decrease of from billion for the year ended december   while average institutional money market aum increased to billion at december   from billion for the year ended december  in addition  our equity aum as a percentage of total aum fell from at december   to at december  this decline in equities within our asset mix is consistent with the decline in global equity markets 
performance fees performance fee revenues are generated on certain management contracts when performance hurdles are achieved 
they are recorded in operating revenues as of the performance measurement date  when the contractual performance criteria have been met 
the performance measurement date is defined in each contract in which incentive and performance fee revenue agreements are in effect 
if performance arrangements require repayment of the performance fee for failure to perform during the contractual period  then performance fee revenues are recognized no earlier than the expiration date of these terms and no later than the first date of performance measurement after the expiration of these terms 
performance fees will fluctuate from period to period and may not correlate with general market changes  since most of the fees are driven by relative performance to the respective benchmark rather than absolute performance 
in  these fees increased to million million 
the performance fees generated in arose primarily in the invesco quantitative strategies and real estate groups  as well as in the uk  whereas the performance fees generated in included amounts generated primarily in the uk and asia 
service and distribution fees service fees are generated through fees charged to cover several types of expenses  including fund accounting fees and other maintenance costs for mutual funds  unit trusts and icvcs  and administrative fees earned from closed ended funds 
service fees also include transfer agent fees  which are fees charged to cover the expense of processing client share purchases and redemptions  call center support and client reporting 
us distribution fees can include b fees earned from certain mutual funds to cover allowable sales and marketing expenses for those funds and also include asset based sales charges paid by certain mutual funds for a period of time after the sale of those funds 
distribution fees typically vary in relation to the amount of client assets managed 
generally  retail products offered outside of the us do not generate a separate distribution fee  as the quoted management fee rate is inclusive of these services 
in  service and distribution fees decreased to million million primarily due to decreased retail aum  offset by increases in institutional money market revenues resulting from the increase in average institutional money market aum during the year 
other revenues other revenues include fees derived primarily from transaction commissions earned upon the sale of new investments into certain of our retail funds and fees earned upon the completion of transactions in our real estate and private equity assets groups 
real estate transaction fees are derived from commissions earned through the buying and selling of properties 
private equity transaction fees include commissions associated with the restructuring of and fees from providing advice to portfolio companies held by the funds 
the measurement date in which these transaction fees are recorded is the date on which the transaction is legally closed 
other revenues also include the revenues of consolidated investment products 
in  other revenues decreased to million million driven by decreases in sales volumes of funds subject to front end commissions  offset by higher transaction fees within our private equity business 
third party distribution  service and advisory expenses third party distribution  service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions paid to independent financial advisors for as long as the clients assets are invested and are payments for the servicing of client accounts 
renewal commissions are calculated based upon a percentage of the aum value 
third party distribution expenses also include the amortization of upfront commissions paid to broker dealers for sales of fund shares with a contingent deferred sales charge a charge levied to the investor for client redemption of aum within a certain contracted period of time 
the distribution commissions are amortized over the redemption period 
also included in third party distribution  service and advisory expenses are sub transfer agency fees that are paid to third parties for processing client share purchases and redemptions  call center support and client reporting 
third party distribution  service and advisory expenses may increase or decrease at a rate different from the rate of change in service and distribution fee revenues due to the inclusion of distribution  service and advisory expenses for the uk and canada  where the related revenues are recorded as investment management fee revenues  as noted above 
third party distribution  service and advisory expenses decreased in to million  million  consistent with the declines in investment management and service and distribution fee revenues 
proportional share of revenues  net of third party distribution expenses  from joint venture investments management believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues  net of third party distribution expenses  from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues  as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making
