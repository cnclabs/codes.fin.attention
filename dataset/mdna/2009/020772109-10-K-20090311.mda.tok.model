item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our selected five year financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this report 
cautionary statement for forward looking information certain information set forth in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking statements include statements concerning our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events  future revenues or performance  capital expenditures  financing needs  plans or intentions relating to potential acquisitions and other information that is not historical information 
when used in this report  the words estimates  expects  anticipates  forecasts  plans  intends  believes and variations of such words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we may make additional forward looking statements from time to time 
all forward looking statements  whether written or oral and whether made by us or on our behalf  are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the application of these accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide timely and reliable financial information 
our critical accounting polices include the following inventories inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates average cost or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
we assess our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory and write down the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future sales and supply on hand  if necessary 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition for sales transactions  we comply with the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title transfers and the customer assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are satisfied upon shipment of product and revenues are recognized accordingly 
sales returns and rebates sales are reduced for any anticipated sales returns  rebates and allowances based on historical experience 
since our return policy is only days and our products are not generally susceptible to external factors such as technological obsolescence or significant changes in demand  we are able to make a reasonable estimate for returns 
we offer end user product specific and sales volume rebates to select distributors 
our rebates are based on actual sales and accrued monthly 
stock based compensation the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective application method 
sfas r requires companies to record compensation expense for the value of all outstanding and unvested share based payments  including employee stock options and similar awards 

table of contents the fair values of stock option grants are determined using the black scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions expected stock price volatility based on historical and management s expectations of future volatility  risk free interest rates from published sources  years to maturity based on historical data and no dividend yield  as management currently does not intend to pay dividends in the near future 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
in addition  the option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect their fair value 
overview alpha pro tech is in the business of protecting people  products and environments 
we accomplish this by developing  manufacturing and marketing a line of high value disposable protective apparel and infection control products for the cleanroom  industrial  pharmaceutical  medical and dental markets

our products as classified above are grouped into four business segments 
the disposable protective apparel segment  consisting of disposable protective apparel  the infection control segment  consisting of face masks and eye shields  the extended care segment  consisting of extended care products  namely medical bed pads and pet beds  and the engineered products segment  consisting of construction weatherization products such as rex wrap house wrap and rex synfelt synthetic roof underlayment 
our target markets are pharmaceutical manufacturing  bio pharmaceutical manufacturing  medical device manufacturing  lab animal research  high technology electronics manufacturing which includes the semi conductor market  medical and dental distributors  pet stores and pet distributors and construction supply and roofing distributors

results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative income from operations income before provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
consolidated sales for the twelve months ended december  increased to  from  for the twelve months ended december   representing an increase of  or 
this increase consists of increased sales of engineered products segment of  and increased infection control segment sales of  partially offset by decreased disposable protective apparel products of  and decreased sales from our extended care products segment of  sales for the disposable protective apparel segment for the twelve months ended december  decreased by  or to  compared to  for the same period of the decrease is primarily related to decreased sales to our largest distributor as well as lower sales to other cleanroom and industrial distributors  partially offset by increased sales to a major national distributor with which we received preferred vendor status during the first quarter of although our shipments to our largest distributor were weak in  their shipments of our products to their end users were much stronger than our sales to them 
we expect sales for to be improved as compared to engineered products segment sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by  or to  as compared to  for the same period of the segment increase of is primarily due to a increase in sales of rex synfelt synthetic roof underlayment and a increase in sales of rex wrap house wrap 
the sales mix of the engineered products sales for the year ended december  synthetic roof underlayment and house wrap 
this compared to synthetic roof underlayment and house wrap in our engineered products distribution channel strategy is continuing to gain momentum 
our rex synthetic roof underlayment is being positively received as a superior product in the industry and we believe is a cost effective and better alternative to felt paper 
our icc es approval for our rex wrap house wrap significantly expands our market opportunities as many construction supply companies  builders and architects require this certification to sell the product 
as well  our high quality  multi color printed house wrap gives us a distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace 
we continue to be optimistic that our distribution channel strategy will broaden our ability to take advantage of market opportunities for synthetic roof underlayment and house wrap throughout next year and into the future 
although our sales are growing and are expected to continue to grow  the downturn in the economy and in particular the housing market will affect our sales 
we are currently working on opportunities with existing and new distributors and we are optimistic about the future of this segment 
infection control segment sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by  or to  compared to  for the same period of shield sales were up and mask sales were down when compared to last year 
shield sales improved in due to the fact that we received a million shield order in the fourth quarter of  from the same customer from which we received the non recurring order from in the first quarter of this order is being shipped out over a period of three quarters and commenced shipping in the fourth quarter of as of december  we have shipped  of the order  the balance of  will ship in mask sales decreased by in primarily due a decrease in n respirator mask sales partially offset by an increase in dental and industrial mask sales 
shield sales should improve in due to the above mentioned order but  unless concerns about avian flu increase  we expect mask sales in to be similar to sales from our extended care segment decreased by  or to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in sales is primarily the result of lower pet bed sales 
this line of products is not expected to be a growth segment for the company

additionally  cost of goods for the disposable protective apparel segment increased in china and the united states due to increased labor and material costs in china  the strengthening chinese currency and higher crude oil prices  which has also impacted our gross profit margin

although sales only increased by or million in  sales for this segment were up or million through the first nine months of year over year growth was significantly impacted by weak shipments in the fourth quarter of to our largest distributor as well as a record quarter in the fourth quarter of although our shipments to this distributor were weak in the fourth quarter  their shipments to their end users were in line with their quarterly average sales 
in september  we announced the signing of a new distribution contract with our largest distributor in which they retained the exclusive right to sell our private label critical cover products  but have also allowed us the right to sell alpha pro tech branded products to other distributors

new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement addresses how to calculate fair value measurements required or permitted under other accounting pronouncements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
sfas was effective beginning january  for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
our adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb deferred for one year the effective date of sfas only with respect to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis  and removed certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas sfas is effective for us as of january  for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non recurring basis 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas was effective for us as of january   however we did not elect to apply the fair value option to any financial instruments or other items upon adoption or during the twelve months ended december  as a result  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas which changes the accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary in consolidated financial statements 
sfas recharacterizes minority interests as noncontrolling interests and requires noncontrolling interests to be classified as a component of shareholders equity 
sfas is effective january  and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
we do not consolidate our partially owned affiliated and therefore we do not expect the application of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  sfas r  which changes how business combinations are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas r is effective january   and will be applied prospectively 
the impact of adopting sfas r will depend on the nature and terms of future acquisitions 

table of contents we periodically review new accounting standards that are issued 
although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to us  we have not identified any other new standards that we believe merit further discussion  and we expect that none would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we subcontract the manufacture of products in china and to a lesser extent in mexico and have a joint venture in india 
in addition  our executive office  which employs people  is located in canada 
our results of operations could be negatively affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to stronger economic conditions in those countries 
we believe we do not have a material foreign currency exposure due to the fact that our purchase agreements with companies in china  india and mexico are in us dollars 
in canada our foreign currency exposure is not material due to the fact that we do not manufacture in canada 
we do not expect any significant effect on our results of operations from inflation or interest and currency rate fluctuations 
we do not hedge our interest rate or foreign exchange risks
