our people our people are critical to the success of our business 
our chief executive officer and other members of our senior leadership team have been involved in our business since its commencement under ge 
as of december   we had more than  employees worldwide 
as of that date  approximately  of our employees held post graduate degrees and approximately  were university graduates 
in addition  as of that date we had more than  employees with six sigma green belt training and employees with six sigma black belt training  as well as more than  lean trained employees 
recruiting we continue to face increasing competition for skilled employees 
we have developed a number of innovative methods to recruit sufficiently skilled employees while still controlling our entry level salaries 
in particular  we seek to widen the available talent pool by recruiting aggressively in places where there is less competition 
we also hire people who do not have prior experience or training and use our extensive training capability to equip them with the skills they need to be effective 
some measures we use include the following in  we formed a joint venture with niit to create a training organization designed to address the increasing demand for skilled workers in the business process technology services industry 
as of february  approximately  of our employees received training from the joint venture 
we have opened delivery centers in cities that are considered less developed 
there is often less competition for available talent in less developed cities although we have found the pool of well trained applicants to be comparable to other metropolitan cities 
we work with universities in our indian geographic locations in order to build an appropriate curriculum with the aim that graduates in those cities will have the skills they need to be effective employees and will be familiar with us 
we have storefront premises that we use for recruiting 
in  approximately of our new hires were recruited through our storefront locations 
we also actively encourage our existing employees to refer new candidates to us  and we provide existing employees with monetary bonuses when such referrals result in new hires 
in  approximately of our new hires were referrals 
training we believe in extensive and continuous training of our employees 
we have the infrastructure to train approximately  people at any one time with over trainers and we have approximately  people enrolled in part time professional degree programs provided by universities and other third parties 
our training programs are designed to transfer the industry specific knowledge and experience of our industry leaders to ensure we maintain our deep process expertise and domain expertise across all industries in which we work 
our training programs cover a vast number of topics  including specific service offerings  key technical and it skills  our different clients workplace cultures 
table of contents and six sigma and lean methodologies 
we also have programs modeled on ge management training programs to develop the next generation of leaders and managers of our business  all of whom are needed to support the rapid growth we are experiencing 
a large part of our continuous training is designed to up skill our employees 
that is  we run training programs for employees on an ongoing basis so that they can acquire new skills and move on to higher responsibility or higher value jobs 
retention in order to meet our growth and service commitments  we are constantly striving to attract and retain employees 
there is significant turnover of employees in the business process outsourcing and information technology sectors generally  particularly in india where the majority of our employees are currently based 
competition for skilled employees in india is very high due to strong economic growth and an increased number of players in this space 
our attrition rate for all employees who have been employed by us for one day or more was in a number of our competitors calculate employee attrition rates for their indian employees who have been employed for six months or more 
on this basis our indian employee attrition rate for would be approximately  which we believe is relatively low for our industry based on statistics published by third parties such as nasscom 
we attribute this low attrition rate to a number of factors including our effective recruiting measures  extensive training and a strong culture of providing opportunities for growth and learning 
approximately of our employees were promoted in we also take aggressive action to monitor and minimize potential attrition 
using six sigma principles we have developed an early warning system that tracks employees and gives us an insight into which employees are most likely to resign 
these employees are automatically highlighted to management who can take action such as relocating the employee or enrolling the employee in continuing education programs to reduce the possibility and impact of such a resignation 
as another measure designed to minimize attrition  we follow the practice of right skilling our employees to the tasks assigned to them 
this means that we match the level of services required to the experience and qualification of the employee concerned and we avoid having over qualified people in any particular job 
this allows us to give our highly qualified and experienced people higher value jobs and  coupled with the practice of up skilling  ensures better career paths for all our employees 
sales and marketing we market our services to both existing and potential clients through our business development team 
this team consists of approximately people as of december  based in the united states  europe  australia and asia 
we spend time trying to expand the services we provide to our existing strategic clients as well as develop new clients 
we have dedicated global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships 
the relationship manager is supported by process improvement  quality  transition  finance  human resources and information technology teams to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our clients 
we constantly measure our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels for each client  using measures such as net promoter scores 
our marketing efforts typically involve a lengthy selling cycle to secure a new client 
our efforts may begin in response to a perceived opportunity  a reference by an existing client  a request for proposal  an introduction by one of our directors or otherwise 
in addition to our business development personnel  the sales effort involves people from the relevant service areas  people familiar with that prospective client s industry  business leaders and six sigma resources 
we may expend substantial time 
table of contents and capital in securing new business 
see item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview revenues 
as our relationship with a client grows  the time required to win an engagement for additional services often gradually declines 
in addition  as we become more knowledgeable about a client s business and processes  our ability to identify opportunities to create value for the client typically increases 
in particular  productivity benefits and greater business impact can often be achieved by focusing on processes that are upstream or downstream from the processes we initially handle  or by applying our analytical and it capabilities to re engineer processes 
in addition  clients often become more willing over time to turn over more complex and critical processes to us as we demonstrate our capabilities 
we also try to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients senior management 
these c level relationships ensure that both parties are focused on driving client value from the top down 
high level executive relationships have been particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients 
it also provides us with a forum for addressing client concerns 
our new business review process we follow a rigorous review process to evaluate all new business 
this is to ensure that all new business fits with our pricing and service objectives 
this process starts with the presentation of new business to our deal review committee which comprises members of our senior leadership team along with operations people and members of our finance department 
this committee applies a set of well developed criteria to review the key terms of that new business 
if  as a result of the review  the committee concludes that the new business is potentially attractive and a good use of our resources  then our business development team is authorized to pursue the opportunity 
prior to executing any contract in respect of new business  our deal review committee meets again to review the client relationship and to confirm that the terms of the new business continue to meet our criteria 
delivery centers we commenced business in in gurgaon  india 
since then we have established global delivery capabilities consisting of more than delivery centers in twelve countries not including our employees who are onsite at our clients premises 
we choose the location of our delivery centers based on a number of factors which include the available talent pool  infrastructure  government support and operating costs  as well as client demand 
we were one of the first companies in our industry to move into some of our locations including dalian  china  budapest  hungary  bucharest  romania  and gurgaon  jaipur and kolkata in india 
we aim to be continuously connected with our clients requirements so that we are ready to serve their needs 
we constantly evaluate new locations  including new countries and new cities within countries in which we currently operate  for new delivery centers and offices 
the large number of different countries from which we service our clients differentiates us from a number of our competitors and enables us to take advantage of different languages and time zones which  in turn  enhances our ability to service global clients 
as of december   we provided services in approximately different languages 
some of our clients also contract with us for additional redundancy and back up protections 

table of contents the map below shows the location of our existing global delivery centers and our regional corporate offices 
we have multiple locations in some cities 
graphic we set forth below a table showing our net revenues in attributable to the main regions in which we have delivery centers 
a portion of the net revenues we attribute to india consists of net revenues for services performed by delivery centers or at client premises outside of india by business units or personnel normally based in india

niit joint venture in june  we formed a joint venture called niit uniqua  or niitjv  with niit  one of the largest training institutes in asia 
niitjv is a training organization designed to address the increasing demand for skilled workers in the business process and technology services industry 
genpact owns of niitjv 
intellectual property we develop intellectual property in the course of our business and our msas with our clients regulate the ownership of such intellectual property 
we have applied for patents  trademarks and domain names 
some of our intellectual property rights relate to proprietary business process enhancements 

table of contents we generally use third party software platforms and the software systems of our clients to provide our services 
we normally enter into licensing agreements with our clients in relation to their software systems 
it is our practice to enter into an employee information proprietary information agreement with all of our new employees that ensures that all new intellectual property developed in the course of our employees employment is assigned to us  provides for that employee s co operation in intellectual property protection matters even if they no longer work for us  and includes a confidentiality undertaking by that employee 
competition we compete in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving global market 
we have a number of competitors offering the same or similar services to us 
our competitors include large multinational service providers  such as accenture ltd and international business machines corporation  companies that are primarily bpo service providers operating from low cost countries  most commonly india  such as wns holdings limited and exlservice holdings  inc  companies that are primarily it service providers with some bpo service capabilities  such as infosys technologies limited  tata consultancy services limited and wipro limited  and smaller  niche service providers that provide services in a specific geographic market  industry or service area 
in addition  a client or potential client may choose not to outsource its business  including by setting up captive outsourcing operations or by performing formerly outsourced services for themselves 
our revenues are derived primarily from fortune global and fortune companies 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include skills and capabilities of people  ability to add value  including through continuous process improvement  reputation and client references  price  technical and industry expertise  scope of services  quality of services and solutions  ability to sustain long term client relationships  and global reach and scale

the indian sez legislation introduced a new tax holiday in certain situations for operations established in designated special economic zones 
the new tax benefits are available only for new business operations that are conducted at qualifying sez locations 
during  we established new delivery centers in two cities in india that would be eligible for these benefits 
we do not presently know what percentage of our operations or income in india in future years will be eligible for a tax holiday under the new law

risk factors risks related to our business our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients businesses and levels of business activity 
the united states and global economies are currently experiencing a period of substantial adverse economic uncertainty with wide ranging effects  including contraction of overall economic activity in various parts of the world 
global economic and political conditions affect our clients businesses and the markets they serve 
if we are unable successfully to anticipate changing economic and political conditions  we may be unable to plan effectively for and respond to those changes  and our business could be negatively affected 
worsening economic conditions or a prolonged recession could adversely affect our clients financial condition and the levels of business activity of our clients and the industries we serve 
this may reduce demand for our services or depress pricing of those services and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
ge accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and any loss of business from  or change in our relationship with  ge could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have derived and are likely to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from ge 
for  and  ge accounted for  and of our revenues  
table of contents respectively 
in addition  our more mature client relationships  such as ge  typically generate higher margins than those from newer clients 
the loss of business from ge could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our master services agreement  or msa  with ge commits ge to purchase  on an annual basis through  a stipulated minimum dollar amount of services or pay us certain costs in lieu thereof 
the costs which ge would be required to pay if it does not meet a minimum annual commitment are not necessarily equal to the amount by which ge s purchases fall short of that minimum annual commitment 
while our revenues from ge in were million  exceeding by million the stipulated minimum annual amount for that year  there is no assurance that actual revenues from ge in future years will meet the minimum annual commitment or exceed it by as much as in or that ge will continue to be a client at all 
revenues in excess of the minimum annual commitment can be credited  subject to certain limitations  against shortfalls in subsequent years 
in addition  the msa provides that the minimum annual committed amount of million will be reduced during the last three years of the term  to million in  million in and million in the msa provides that the minimum annual committed amount is subject to reduction in certain circumstances  including as a result of the termination of any statements of work  or sows  by ge for cause  non performance of services by us due to specified force majeure events or certain other reasons 
the msa also does not require ge to engage us exclusively in respect of business process services 
in addition  pricing terms and pricing levels under future sows may be lower than in the past 
in particular  because of the size of ge and its importance to our business it is able to exert considerable leverage on us when negotiating the terms of sows 
our business from ge comes from a variety of ge s businesses and decisions to use our services are currently  as a general matter  made by a number of people within ge 
therefore  although some decisions may be made centrally at ge  the total level of business we receive generally depends on the decisions of the various operating managers of such businesses 
in addition  if ge sells or divests any of the businesses to which we provide services  the new management or new owners of such businesses may choose to discontinue our services 
furthermore  following december   ge will no longer be subject to a contractual restriction with us on its ability to set up a separate business unit to provide english language business process services from low wage countries 
there can be no assurance that ge will not establish such a separate business unit or otherwise compete with us at such time 
while we were a captive operation of ge  ge followed a practice of granting to the business units that purchased our services a credit for financial measurement purposes designed to approximate the profit realized by our business on such services 
we have been advised that this practice remains in effect for sows entered into prior to january  and is not in effect for sows entered into after such time 
we have entered into new sows with most of the divisions of ge since the practice was discontinued 
the discontinuation of this practice could affect whether and on what terms a ge business unit may enter into new sows in the future 
ge  through its affiliates  is a significant shareholder of our company and as of december  it  through its affiliates  beneficially owns of our common shares 
if ge s percentage of ownership of our common shares decreases in the future  there can be no assurance that ge will continue to contract for our services to the same extent or on the same terms 
we may be unable to manage our growth effectively and maintain effective internal controls  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
since we became an independent company  we have experienced rapid growth and significant expansion and diversification of our operations  which has placed significant demands on our leadership team s time and our operational resources 
since december   we have incurred  and we continue to incur  substantial expenses to create the management infrastructure and other capabilities necessary to operate as a stand alone business 
from january  to december  our net 
table of contents revenues have grown approximately and our number of employees has grown approximately 
there can be no assurance that our revenues will continue to grow as rapidly in the future or  if our revenues do grow  that our margins will also grow 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve operational systems  procedures and internal controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement these systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis  we may not be able to retain clients or obtain new business  hire and retain new employees  complete future acquisitions or operate our business effectively 
we may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations 
our industry relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees 
historically  high employee attrition has been common in our industry 
see item business our people 
in  our attrition rate for all employees who were employed for a day or more was approximately 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to reduce our level of attrition or even maintain our attrition rate at the level 
if our attrition rate increases  our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease 
despite current economic conditions  competition for qualified employees  particularly in india and china  remains high and we expect such competition to continue 
we compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries  such as software services  engineering services and financial services companies 
in many locations in which we operate  there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work 
if our business continues to grow  the number of people we will need to hire will increase 
we will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through innovative recruiting and retention policies 
significant competition for employees could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our clients  as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs 
over the next few years we will lose certain tax benefits provided in india to companies in our industry and it is not clear whether new tax policies will provide equivalent benefits and incentives 
under the indian income tax act   our delivery centers in india  from which we derived the majority of our revenues in fiscal  benefit from a ten year holiday from indian corporate income taxes in respect of their export income as defined in the legislation under the software technology parks of india stpi scheme 
as a result of this tax holiday  prior to we incurred minimal income tax expense with respect to our indian operations 
in the absence of this tax holiday  income derived from our indian operations would be taxed up to the maximum tax rate generally applicable to indian enterprises  which  as of december   was 
the tax holiday enjoyed by our delivery centers in india under the stpi scheme expires in stages 
our tax holiday partially expired on march  in respect of approximately of our indian operations and on march  in respect of approximately of our indian operations and will further expire on march  in respect of approximately of our indian operations  depending in each case on when each delivery center commenced operations 
the tax holiday in respect of the balance of our indian operations will expire on march  as the stpi tax holiday expires  our indian tax expense will materially increase and our after tax profitability will be materially reduced  unless we can obtain comparable benefits under new legislation or otherwise reduce our tax liability 
the special economic zones act   or the sez legislation  introduced a new year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated special economic zones or sezs 
under the sez legislation  qualifying operations are eligible for a deduction from taxable income equal to i of their export profits as defined in the legislation derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations  ii of such export profits for the next five years  and iii of the export profits for a further five years  subject to satisfying certain capital investment requirements 

table of contents the sez legislation provides  among other restrictions  that this holiday is not available to operations formed by splitting up or reconstructing existing operations or transferring existing plant and equipment to new sez locations 
during  we established new centers that we expect to be eligible for the sez benefits 
it is not clear  however  what percentage of our operations or income in india is eligible for sez benefits  as this will depend on how much of our business can be conducted at the qualifying locations and how much of that business can be considered to meet the restrictive conditions described above 
in  we signed agreements with certain developers and local governments to purchase and or lease qualifying sez property 
our first sez unit also became operational during in a leased facility 
however  because this is new legislation  there is continuing uncertainty as to the interpretation of the required governmental and regulatory approvals 
this uncertainty may delay development of our proposed sez locations 
the sez legislation is currently a politically sensitive issue in india 
the ministry of finance in india has expressed concern about potential tax revenues being lost as a result of the exemptions under the sez legislation 
the sez legislation has been criticized on economic grounds by the international monetary fund and it has been suggested that the sez legislation may be challenged by the world trade organization 
it is possible that  as a result of such political pressures  the procedure for obtaining the benefits of the sez legislation may become more onerous  that the types of real property eligible for sez status will be further restricted or that the sez legislation will be amended or repealed 
accordingly  we currently do not expect that the benefits  if any  that we may derive under the sez legislation will be equivalent to the benefits we will be gradually losing under the existing tax holiday 
consequently  we expect that our tax rate in india and our overall tax rate will increase over the next few years and that such increase is likely to be material and is likely to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if the transfer pricing arrangements we have among our subsidiaries are determined to be inappropriate  our tax liability may increase 
we have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business  including operations  marketing  sales and delivery functions 
us and indian transfer pricing regulations  as well as regulations applicable in other countries in which we operate  require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be on arm s length terms 
we consider the transactions among our subsidiaries to be substantially on arm s length terms 
if  however  a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and determines that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate  or that other income of our affiliates should be taxed in that jurisdiction  we may incur increased tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties  which would cause our tax expense to increase  possibly materially  thereby reducing our profitability and cash flows 
new tax legislation and the results of actions by taxing authorities may have an adverse effect on our operations and our overall tax rate 
in  the government of india enacted a fringe benefit tax on the exercise of share options granted to employees based in india 
this tax is payable by the issuer of the share options and recoverable at the option of the issuer from its employees 
depending on the number of options exercised by our employees  this tax may materially and adversely impact our results of operations  although it would not affect cash flow if fully recovered from employees 
the government of india may assert that certain of our clients have a permanent establishment in india by reason of the activities we perform on their behalf  particularly those clients that exercise 
table of contents control over or have substantial dependency on our services 
such an assertion could affect the size and scope of the services requested by such clients in the future 
the government of india has served notice on the company about its potential liability  as a representative assessee of ge  for indian tax upon ge s sale of shares of a predecessor of the company 
ge has challenged the positions of the government of india in the delhi high court  naming genpact india one of the company s subsidiaries as necessary party but without seeking relief against genpact india 
we believe that if indian tax were due upon that sale  it could not be successfully asserted against us as a representative assessee 
moreover  ge is obligated to indemnify us for any tax on its sale of shares 
although there can be no assurance that the government of india would agree  we also believe that no indian tax is due upon the sale of our shares in the ipo by our existing significant shareholders  that even if such a tax were due it could not be successfully asserted against us as a representative assessee of such a shareholder  and that we would have a statutory right under indian law to recover any such tax from such a shareholder 
we also believe that sales by non indian shareholders of our shares in the market generally will not be subject to indian tax  provided that the selling shareholder is not otherwise subject to tax in india 
the government of china recently enacted amendments to the tax laws applicable to our operations that have increased  effective  the applicable tax rate from to  the impact of this increase in tax rate could be material depending on the growth of our business in china 
our ability to repatriate surplus earnings from our delivery centers in a tax efficient manner is dependent upon interpretations of local laws  possible changes in such laws and the renegotiation of existing double tax avoidance treaties 
changes to any of these may adversely affect our overall tax rate  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from clients in the united states 
if events or conditions occur which adversely affect our ability to do business in the united states  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
we currently derive  and are likely to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from clients located in the united states 
a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to do business in the united states  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the united states economy is currently in a recession and undergoing a period of substantial economic uncertainty  resulting in credit market dislocations  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment 
a continuing deterioration in economic activity in the united states could adversely affect demand for our services  particularly by our clients in the financial services industry  thus reducing our revenue 
we could also be affected by declines in the value of the us dollar against the indian rupee  in which we incur the majority of our costs  or other currencies in which we incur costs 
we may also be adversely affected by the enactment of laws in the united states that impose restrictions on  or taxation or other financial penalties with respect to  offshore outsourcing 
future legislation in the united states and other jurisdictions could significantly affect the ability of our clients to utilize our services 
the issue of companies outsourcing services to organizations operating in other countries is a topic of political discussion in many countries 
for example  many organizations and public figures in the united states have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore service providers and the loss of jobs in the united states 
in addition  there has been publicity about negative experiences associated with offshore outsourcing  such as theft and misappropriation of sensitive client data  particularly involving service providers in india 
current or prospective clients may elect to 
table of contents perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring these services from onshore to offshore providers to avoid negative perceptions that may be associated with using an offshore provider 
any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward offshore outsourcing would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide services from the united states 
in the united states measures aimed at limiting or restricting offshore outsourcing have been proposed  including in connection with the recent troubled assets relief program 
such measures have been enacted in a few states and there is currently legislation pending in several states 
the measures that have been enacted to date generally have restricted the ability of government entities to outsource work to offshore business process service providers and have not materially adversely affected our business  primarily because we do not currently work for such governmental entities and they are not currently a focus of our sales strategy 
however  there can be no assurance that pending or future legislation in the united states that would significantly adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition will not be enacted 
legislation enacted in certain european jurisdictions and any future legislation in europe  japan or any other country in which we have clients restricting the performance of business process services from an offshore location could also have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  legislation enacted in the united kingdom  based on the ec acquired rights directive  which has been adopted in some form by many european union  or eu  countries  provides that if a company outsources all or part of its business to a service provider or changes its current service provider  the affected employees of the company or of the previous service provider are entitled to become employees of the new service provider  generally on the same terms and conditions as their original employment 
in addition  dismissals of employees who were employed by the company or the previous service provider immediately prior to that transfer are automatically considered unfair dismissals that entitle such employees to compensation 
as a result  in order to avoid unfair dismissal claims we may have to offer  and become liable for  voluntary redundancy payments to the employees of our clients in the united kingdom and other eu countries who have adopted similar laws who outsource business to us 
we believe that this legislation could materially affect our ability to obtain new business from companies in the eu and  after including the cost of the potential compensation paid for unfair dismissal claims or redundancies  to provide outsourced services to our current and future clients in the eu in a cost effective manner 
wage increases in the countries in which we have operations may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
salaries and related benefits of our employees are our most significant costs 
most of our employees are based in india and other countries in which wage levels have historically been significantly lower than wage levels in the united states and western europe for comparably skilled professionals  which has been one of our competitive advantages 
however  wage levels for comparably skilled employees in most of the countries in which we operate have increased and further increases are expected at a faster rate than in the united states and western europe because of  among other reasons  faster economic growth  increased competition for skilled employees and increased demand for business process services 
we will lose this competitive advantage to the extent that we are not able to control or share wage increases with our clients 
sharing wage increases may cause our clients to be less willing to utilize our services 
in addition  wage increases may reduce our margins 
we will attempt to control such costs by our efforts to add capacity in locations where we consider wage levels of skilled personnel to be satisfactory  but we may not be successful in doing so 
we may need to increase our wage levels significantly and rapidly in order to attract the quantity and quality of employees that are necessary for us to remain competitive  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents currency exchange rate fluctuations in various currencies in which we do business  especially the indian rupee and the us dollar  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
most of our revenues are denominated in us dollars  with the remaining amounts largely in euros  pounds sterling and japanese yen 
most of our expenses are incurred and paid in indian rupees  with the remaining amounts largely in us dollars  chinese renminbi  pounds sterling  euros  guatemalan quetzal  hungarian forints  moroccan dirham  philippine pesos  australian dollars  polish zloty  and romania leu 
as we expand our operations to new countries  we will incur expenses in other currencies 
we report our financial results in us dollars 
the exchange rates between the indian rupee and other currencies in which we incur costs or receive revenues  on the one hand  and the us dollar  on the other hand  have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by certain movements in exchange rates  particularly if the indian rupee or other currencies in which we incur expenses or receive revenues  appreciate against the us dollar 
although we take steps to hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar  mexican rupee us dollar  philippines peso us dollar  peso us dollar  euro romanian leu  euro hungarian forint  pound sterling us dollar  australian dollar us dollar and our chinese renminbi japanese yen foreign currency exposures  there is no assurance that our hedging strategy will be successful or that the hedging markets will have sufficient liquidity or depth for us to implement our strategy in a cost effective manner 
in addition  in some countries such as india and china  we are subject to legal restrictions on hedging activities  as well as convertibility of currencies  which could limit our ability to use cash generated in one country in another country and could limit our ability to hedge our exposures 
finally  our hedging policies only provide near term protection from exchange rate fluctuations 
if the indian rupee or other currencies in which we incur expenses remain at current levels for a significant period of time or appreciate against the us dollar  we may have to consider additional means of maintaining profitability  including by increasing pricing  which may or may not be achievable

restrictions on entry visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our business depends on the ability of our employees to obtain the necessary visas and entry permits to do business in the countries where our clients and  in some cases  our delivery centers  are located 
in response to recent terrorist attacks and global unrest  immigration authorities generally  and those in the united states in particular  have increased the level of scrutiny in granting visas 
if further terrorist attacks occur  then obtaining visas for our personnel may become even more difficult 
local immigration laws may also require us to meet certain other legal requirements as a condition to obtaining or maintaining entry visas 
adverse economic conditions in countries where our clients may be located may create an environment where countries  including the united states  may restrict the number of visas or entry permits available 
in addition  immigration laws are subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement due to political forces  economic conditions or other events  including terrorist attacks 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary visas for our personnel who need to travel internationally  if the issuance of such visas is delayed or if the length of such visas is shortened  we may not be able to provide services to our clients or to continue to provide services on a timely and cost effective basis  receive revenues as early as expected or manage our delivery centers as efficiently as we otherwise could  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could harm our business 
our future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team 
these personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace 
in particular  our chief executive officer and other members of our senior leadership team have been involved in our business since its commencement under ge 
our employment agreement with our chief executive officer does not obligate him to work for us for any specified period  but does contain a limited non compete clause and a non solicitation clause should his employment terminate 
if we lose key members of our senior leadership team  we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges  and this may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract as well as long implementation periods that require significant resource commitments  which result in a long lead time before we receive revenues from new relationships 
we typically face a long selling cycle to secure a new contract 
if we are successful in obtaining an engagement  that is generally followed by a long implementation period in which the services are planned in detail and we demonstrate to a client that we can successfully integrate our processes and resources with their operations 
during this time a contract is also negotiated and agreed 
there is then a long ramping up period in order to commence providing the services 
we typically incur significant business development expenses during the selling cycle 
we may not succeed in winning a new client s business  in which case we receive no revenues and may receive no reimbursement for such expenses 
even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential new client and begin to plan the services in detail  a potential client may choose a competitor or decide to retain the work in house prior to the time a final contract is signed 
if we enter into a contract with a client  we will typically receive no revenues until implementation actually begins 
our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations  thereby further lengthening the implementation cycle 
we generally hire new employees to provide services to a new client once a contract is signed 
we may face significant difficulties in hiring such employees and incur significant costs associated with these hires before we receive corresponding revenues 
if we are not successful in obtaining contractual commitments after the selling cycle  in maintaining contractual commitments after the implementation cycle or in maintaining or reducing the duration of unprofitable initial periods in our contracts  it may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to price appropriately and maintain asset utilization levels and control our costs 
our profitability is largely a function of the efficiency with which we utilize our assets  and in particular our people and delivery centers  and the pricing that we are able to obtain for our services 
our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments  hire and assimilate new employees  forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our geographies and workforces and manage attrition  and our need to devote time and resources to training  professional development and other typically non chargeable activities 
the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors  including our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  competition  introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors  our ability to accurately estimate  attain and sustain revenues from client engagements  margins and cash flows over increasingly longer contract periods and general economic and political conditions 
therefore  if we are unable to price appropriately or manage our asset utilization levels  there could be a material 
table of contents adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our profitability is also a function of our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency 
as we increase the number of our employees and grow our business  we may not be able to manage the significantly larger and more geographically diverse workforce that may result and our profitability may not improve 
new taxes may also be imposed on our services such as sales taxes or service taxes which could affect our competitiveness as well as our profitability 
our long selling cycle and implementation period make it difficult for us to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts and respond in a timely manner to offset such fluctuations 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the long selling cycle for our services as well as the time required to complete the implementation phases of new contracts makes it difficult to accurately predict the timing of revenues from new clients or new sows as well as our costs 
our period to period results may also fluctuate due to changes in our costs or other unforeseen events 
in addition  our results may vary due to currency fluctuations and changes in other global or regional economic and political conditions 
due to these factors  we may be unable to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenues that we do not receive as a result of delays arising from these factors  and our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of the public market  securities analysts or investors 
we enter into long term contracts and fixed price contracts with our clients and we have only limited experience as an independent company in pricing such contracts 
our failure to correctly price these contracts may negatively affect our profitability 
the pricing of our services is usually included in sows entered into with our clients  many of which are for terms of three to five years 
in certain cases  we have committed to pricing over this period with only limited sharing of risk regarding inflation and currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are obligated under some of our contracts to deliver productivity benefits to our clients 
if we fail to estimate accurately future wage inflation rates  currency exchange rates or our costs  or if we fail to accurately estimate the productivity benefits we can achieve under a contract  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a small portion of our sows are currently billed on a fixed price basis rather than on a time and materials basis 
we may increase the number of fixed price contracts we perform in the future 
any failure to accurately estimate the resources or time required to complete a fixed price engagement or to maintain the required quality levels or any unexpected increase in the cost to us of employees  office space or technology could expose us to risks associated with cost overruns and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
we could be liable to our clients for damages and subject to criminal liability and our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or client data is compromised 
we may be liable to our clients for damages caused by disclosure of confidential information or system failures 
we are often required to collect and store sensitive or confidential client data to perform the services we provide under our contracts 
many of our contracts do not limit our potential liability for breaches of confidentiality 
if any person  including any of our current or former employees  penetrates our network security or misappropriates sensitive data or if we do not adapt to changes in data protection legislation  we could be subject to significant liabilities to our clients or to our clients customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client data  whether through breach of our computer systems  systems failure or otherwise  could also damage our reputation and cause us to lose existing and potential clients 
we may also be subject to civil actions and criminal prosecution by government or government agencies for breaches relating to such data 
our insurance coverage for breaches or mismanagement of such data 
table of contents may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claims 
we may be subject to claims for substantial damages by our clients arising out of disruptions to their businesses or inadequate service  and our insurance coverage may be inadequate 
most of our service contracts with clients contain service level and performance requirements  including requirements relating to the quality of our services 
failure to consistently meet service requirements of a client or errors made by our employees in the course of delivering services to our clients could disrupt the client s business and result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for damages against us 
additionally  we could incur liability if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal control failures or impair our client s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 
under our msas with our clients  our liability for breach of our obligations is generally limited to actual damages suffered by the client and is typically capped at the greater of an agreed amount or the fees paid or payable to us under the relevant agreement 
these limitations and caps on liability may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect us from liability for damages 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients or liability for breaches of confidentiality  are generally not limited under those agreements 
our msas are governed by laws of multiple jurisdictions  therefore the interpretation of such provisions  and the availability of defenses to us  may vary  which may contribute to the uncertainty as to the scope of our potential liability 
although we have commercial general liability insurance coverage  the coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claims 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage  or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any failures to adhere to the regulations that govern our business could result in our being unable to effectively perform our services 
failure to adhere to regulations that govern our clients businesses could result in breaches of contract under our msas 
our clients business operations are often subject to regulation  and our clients may require that we perform our services in a manner that will enable them to comply with applicable regulations 
our clients are located around the world  and the laws and regulations that apply include  among others  united states federal laws such as the gramm leach bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act  state laws on debt collection in the united states and the financial services act in the united kingdom as well as similar consumer protection laws in other countries in which our clients customers are based 
failure to perform our services in a manner that complies with any such requirement could result in breaches of contracts with our clients 
in addition  we are required under various laws to obtain and maintain permits and licenses for the conduct of our business in all jurisdictions in which we have operations  including india  and  in some cases  where our clients receive our services  including the united states and europe 
if we do not maintain our licenses or other qualifications to provide our services or if we do not adapt to changes in legislation or regulation  we may have to cease operations in the relevant jurisdictions and may not be able to provide services to existing clients or be able to attract new clients 
in addition  we may be required to expend significant resources in order to comply with laws and regulations in the jurisdictions mentioned above 
any failure to abide by regulations relating either to our business or our clients businesses may also  in some limited circumstances  result in civil fines and criminal penalties for us 
any such ceasing of operations or civil or criminal actions may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents some of our contracts contain provisions which  if triggered  could result in lower future revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
many of our contracts allow a client  in certain limited circumstances  to request a benchmark study comparing our pricing and performance with that of an agreed list of other service providers for comparable services 
based on the results of the study and depending on the reasons for any unfavorable variance  we may be required to make improvements in the services we provide or to reduce the pricing for services to be performed under the remaining term of the contract  which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of our contracts  including our contract with ge  contain provisions that would require us to pay penalties to our clients and or provide our clients with the right to terminate the contract if we do not meet pre agreed service level requirements 
failure to meet these requirements could result in the payment of significant penalties by us to our clients which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a few of our msas provide that during the term of the msa and under specified circumstances  we may not provide similar services to their competitors 
some of our contracts also provide that  during the term of the contract and for a certain period thereafter ranging from six to months  we may not provide similar services to certain or any of their competitors using the same personnel 
these restrictions may hamper our ability to compete for and provide services to other clients in the same industry  which may inhibit growth and result in lower future revenues and profitability 
many of our contracts with clients specify that if a change of control of our company occurs during the term of the contract  the client has the right to terminate the contract 
these provisions may result in our contracts being terminated if there is such a change in control  resulting in a potential loss of revenues 
in addition  these provisions may act as a deterrent to any attempt by a third party to acquire our company 
many of our contracts with clients require that we bear the cost of any sales or withholding taxes or unreimbursed value added taxes imposed on payments made under those contracts 
while we have arranged our contracts to minimize the imposition of these taxes  changes in law or the interpretation thereof and changes in our internal structure may result in the imposition of these taxes and a reduction in our net revenues 
our industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
our industry is highly competitive  highly fragmented and subject to rapid change 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are breadth and depth of process and technology expertise  service quality  the ability to attract  train and retain qualified people  compliance rigor  global delivery capabilities  price  knowledge of industries served and marketing and sales capabilities 
we compete for business with a variety of companies  including large multinational firms that provide consulting  technology and or business process services  off shore business process service providers in low cost locations like india  in house captives of potential clients  software services companies that also provide business process services and accounting firms that also provide consulting or outsourcing services 
some of our competitors have greater financial  marketing  technological or other resources and larger client bases than we do  and may expand their service offerings and compete more effectively for clients and employees than we do 
some of our competitors have more established reputations and client relationships in our markets than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors who do not have global delivery capabilities may expand their delivery centers to the countries in which we are located which could result in increased competition for employees and could reduce our competitive advantage 
the trend toward outsourcing and technological changes may result in new and different competitors entering our markets 
there could also be newer competitors that are more powerful as a result of 
table of contents strategic consolidation of smaller competitors or of companies that each provide different services or service different industries 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as more companies enter our markets 
increased competition may result in lower prices and volumes  higher costs for resources  especially people  and lower profitability 
we may not be able to supply clients with services that they deem superior and at competitive prices and we may lose business to our competitors 
any inability to compete effectively would adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we do not protect our intellectual property or if our services are found to infringe on the intellectual property of others 
our success depends in part on certain methodologies  practices  tools and technical expertise we utilize in designing  developing  implementing and maintaining applications and other proprietary intellectual property rights 
in order to protect our rights in these various intellectual properties  we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements as well as trade secret  copyright and trademark laws 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  clients and potential clients and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we also have submitted united states federal and foreign trademark applications for the names of additional service offerings 
we may not be successful in maintaining or obtaining trademarks for these trade names 
india is a member of the berne convention  an international intellectual property treaty  and has agreed to recognize protections on intellectual property rights conferred under the laws of other foreign countries  including the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the laws  rules  regulations and treaties in effect in the united states  india and the other jurisdictions in which we operate and the contractual and other protective measures we take  are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property  or that such laws will not change 
we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights  and any such steps may not be successful 
infringement by others of our intellectual property  including the costs of enforcing our intellectual property rights  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we believe that we are not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others  claims may nonetheless be successfully asserted against us in the future 
the costs of defending any such claims could be significant  and any successful claim may require us to modify  discontinue or rename any of our services 
any such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india and we are subject to regulatory  economic  social and political uncertainties in india 
we are subject to several risks associated with having a substantial portion of our assets and operations located in india 
in recent years  we have benefited from many policies of the government of india and the indian state governments in the states in which we operate  which are designed to promote foreign investment generally and the business process services industry in particular  including significant tax incentives  relaxation of regulatory restrictions  liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation 
there is no assurance that such policies will continue 
various factors  such as changes in the current federal government  could trigger significant changes in india s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular 

table of contents in addition  our financial performance and the market price of our common shares may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in india  including changes in exchange rates and controls  interest rates and taxation policies  as well as social stability and political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future 
in particular  india has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years  but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead 
these challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education 
our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified employees  develop and operate our delivery centers  and attract and retain clients could be adversely affected if india does not successfully meet these challenges 
our delivery centers are at risk of damage from natural disasters and other disruptions 
our delivery centers or our data and voice communications may be damaged or disrupted as a result of natural disasters such as earthquakes  floods  heavy rains  epidemics  tsunamis and cyclones  technical disruptions such as electricity or infrastructure breakdowns  including damage to telecommunications cables  computer glitches and electronic viruses or man made events such as protests  riots and labor unrest 
such events may lead to the disruption of information systems and telecommunication services for sustained periods 
they also may make it difficult or impossible for employees to reach our business locations 
damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could adversely affect our reputation  our relationships with our clients  our leadership team s ability to administer and supervise our business or it may cause us to incur substantial additional expenditure to repair or replace damaged equipment or delivery centers 
we may also be liable to our clients for disruption in service resulting from such damage or destruction 
while we currently have commercial liability insurance  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient 
furthermore  we may be unable to secure such insurance coverage at premiums acceptable to us in the future or at all 
prolonged disruption of our services would also entitle our clients to terminate their contracts with us 
any of the above factors may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries in which we have no prior operating experience 
we intend to continue to expand our global footprint in order to maintain an appropriate cost structure and meet our clients delivery needs 
this may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate 
it may involve expanding into less developed countries  which may have less political  social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems 
as we expand our business into new countries we may encounter regulatory  personnel  technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses or delay our ability to start up our operations or become profitable in such countries 
this may affect our relationships with our clients and could have an adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to document and assess our internal control over financial reporting and requires our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of these controls 
any failure to maintain effective internal controls or difficulty in satisfying these requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and our stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us  on an ongoing basis  to document and assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with an established internal control framework and to report on our conclusion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
it also requires an independent registered public accounting firm to test our internal control over financial reporting and report on the effectiveness of such controls 
in addition  we are required under the securities exchange act of to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and 
table of contents internal control over financial reporting 
compliance with section requires substantial accounting expense and significant management efforts 
we may in the future fail to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls  or we may discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement  particularly with respect to businesses that we may acquire 
we cannot be certain that any remedial measures we take will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate internal controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in future periods as required by section  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the value of our common shares 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence involving any of the countries in which we or our clients have operations could adversely affect our operations and client confidence 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  such as the attacks in recent years in the united states  india  spain and england  as well as outbreaks of violence in mexico  may adversely affect worldwide financial markets and could potentially lead to economic recession  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
these events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles 
these events also pose significant risks to our people and to our delivery centers and operations around the world 
southern asia has  from time to time  experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries  including india and pakistan 
in recent years  military confrontations between india and pakistan have occurred in the region of kashmir and along the india pakistan border 
there have also been incidents in and near india such as terrorist attacks on the indian parliament and in the city of mumbai  troop mobilizations along the india pakistan border and an aggravated geopolitical situation in the region 
such military activity or terrorist attacks in the future could influence the indian economy by disrupting communications and making travel more difficult 
resulting political tensions could create a greater perception that investments in companies with indian operations involve a high degree of risk  and that there is a risk of disruption of services provided by companies with indian operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our share price and or the market for our services 
furthermore  if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities  particularly hostilities that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear weapons  we might not be able to continue our operations 
we generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks  military conflicts and wars 
if more stringent labor laws become applicable to us or if our employees unionize  our profitability may be adversely affected 
india has stringent labor legislation that protects employee interests  including legislation that sets forth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment 
though we are exempt from some of these labor laws at present under exceptions in some states for providers of it enabled services  there can be no assurance that such laws will not become applicable to us in the future 
if these labor laws become applicable to our employees  it may become difficult for us to maintain flexible human resource policies and attract and employ the numbers of sufficiently qualified candidates that we need or discharge employees  and our compensation expenses may increase significantly 

table of contents in addition  our employees may in the future form unions 
if employees at any of our delivery centers become eligible for union membership  we may be required to raise wage levels or grant other benefits that could result in an increase in our compensation expenses  in which case our profitability may be adversely affected 
we may engage in strategic transactions that could create risks 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly review potential strategic transactions  including potential acquisitions  dispositions  consolidations  joint ventures or similar transactions  some of which may be material 
through the acquisitions we pursue  we may seek opportunities to add to or enhance the services we provide  to enter new industries or expand our global client base  or to strengthen our global presence and scale of operations 
we have made acquisitions in the past  including e transparent bv and certain related entities in  which are controlling partners in a partnership collectively known as ice  axis risk consulting private limited in  moneyline lending services inc in now called genpact mortgage services and creditek corporation in there can be no assurance that we will find suitable candidates in the future for strategic transactions at acceptable prices  have sufficient capital resources to accomplish our strategy  or be successful in entering into agreements for desired transactions 
acquisitions  including completed acquisitions  also pose the risk that any business we acquire may lose customers or employees or could under perform relative to expectations 
we could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems  including problems related to execution or integration 
following the completion of an acquisition  we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support  including financial reporting and internal controls  to the acquired business for a period of time 
there can be no assurance that the seller will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 
our principal shareholders will continue to exercise significant influence over us  and their interests in our business may be different from yours 
a majority of our issued and outstanding common shares are currently beneficially owned by general atlantic  oak hill  ge and wells fargo company  or wells fargo 
as of december  general atlantic and oak hill beneficially own through gico  a jointly owned investment vehicle of our outstanding common shares  ge beneficially owns through its affiliates of our outstanding common shares  and wells fargo beneficially owns through its affiliates of our outstanding common shares 
the shareholders agreement among affiliates of ge  gico  wells fargo and us provides that gico has the right to nominate four directors to our board  so long as they maintain certain minimum shareholding thresholds  and the shareholders party to the agreement have agreed to vote their shares for the election of such persons 
these shareholders can exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs and all matters requiring a shareholders vote  including the composition of our board of directors  the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bye laws  the approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets  our dividend policy and our capital structure and financing 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these shareholders  even if such transactions are beneficial to other shareholders 
the interests of these shareholders may conflict with your interests 
in particular  ge and wells fargo are our clients 
general atlantic and oak hill are significant shareholders and currently hold interests in companies that do compete with us and they may  from to time  make significant investments in companies that could compete with us 
in addition  pursuant to our bye laws and our 
table of contents shareholders agreement and to the extent permitted by applicable law  our directors who are affiliated with our major shareholders are not required to present to us corporate opportunities eg  acquisitions or new potential clients that they become aware of unless such opportunities are presented to them expressly in their capacity as one of our directors 
we may become subject to taxation as a result of our incorporation in bermuda  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have received a written assurance from the bermuda minister of finance under the exempted undertaking tax protection act of bermuda to the effect that if there is enacted in bermuda any legislation imposing tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax shall not be applicable to us or to any of our operations or common shares  debentures or other obligations until march   except in so far as such tax applies to persons ordinarily resident in bermuda or is payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in bermuda 
we cannot assure you that a future minister would honor that assurance  which is not legally binding  or that after such date we would not be subject to any such tax 
if we were to become subject to taxation in bermuda or any other jurisdiction as a result of our incorporation in bermuda  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our shares future sales of our common shares could cause our share price to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of common shares by our employees and other shareholders  or the possibility of such sales  may adversely affect the price of our common shares and impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities 
as of december   general atlantic  oak hill  ge and wells fargo beneficially owned in the aggregate  common shares  representing approximately of our outstanding common shares 
such shareholders will be able to sell their common shares in the public market from time to time without registering them  subject to certain limitations on the timing  amount and method of those sales imposed by rule under the securities act of  as amended 
pursuant to the shareholders agreement  an affiliate of ge  gico and wells fargo will have the right  subject to certain conditions  to require us to file registration statements covering all of the common shares including restricted shares and common shares issuable upon the exercise of currently outstanding options which they own or to include those common shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other shareholders 
following their registration and sale under the applicable registration statement  those shares will become freely tradable 
by exercising their registration rights and selling a large number of common shares  these holders could cause the price of our common shares to decline 
in addition  the perception in the public markets that sales by them might occur could also adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares  other than dividends paid by the predecessor to ge in the reorganization 
for the foreseeable future  we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common shares 
our ability to pay dividends is also subject to restrictive covenants contained in our credit facility agreement governing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries have incurred or may incur in the future 

table of contents any dividends paid to us shareholders could be subject to tax at ordinary income rates 
the maximum us tax rate on certain dividends paid to individuals is percent through legislation was introduced in march that  if enacted in its present form  would deny to individuals the percent tax rate on dividends received from a corporation located in a jurisdiction  like bermuda  that lacks a comprehensive tax system 
if this bill becomes law  dividends paid to us shareholders  if any  could be subject to tax at ordinary income rates 
we are organized under the laws of bermuda  and bermuda law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to shareholders 
our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a state of the united states 
as a bermuda company  we are governed by the companies act bermuda  as amended  or the companies act 
the companies act differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders  including the provisions relating to interested directors  mergers  amalgamations and acquisitions  takeovers  shareholder lawsuits and indemnification of directors 
generally  the duties of directors and officers of a bermuda company are owed to the company only 
shareholders of bermuda companies generally do not have rights to take action against directors or officers of the company and may only do so in limited circumstances 
officers of a bermuda company must  in exercising their powers and performing their duties  act honestly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the company and must exercise the care and skill that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in comparable circumstances 
directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries 
if a director or officer of a bermuda company is found to have breached his or her duties to that company  he may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty 
a director may be liable jointly and severally with other directors if it is shown that the director knowingly engaged in fraud or dishonesty 
in cases not involving fraud or dishonesty  the liability of the director will be determined by the bermuda courts on the basis of their estimation of the percentage of responsibility of the director for the matter in question  in light of the nature of the conduct of the director and the extent of the causal relationship between his or her conduct and the loss suffered 
in addition  our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers or directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties  except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director or to recover any gain  personal profit or advantage to which such officer or director is not legally entitled 
this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 
in addition  the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under bermuda law are not as clearly established as under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states  particularly the state of delaware 
therefore  our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a state within the united states 

table of contents the market price for our common shares has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market price for our common shares has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts  changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies engaged in providing business process services  loss of one or more significant clients  addition or loss of executive officers or key employees  regulatory developments in our target markets affecting us  our clients or our competitors  announcements of technological developments  limited liquidity in our trading market  sales or expected sales of additional common shares  and terrorist attacks or natural disasters or other such events impacting countries where we or our clients have operations 
in addition  securities markets generally and from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
you may be unable to effect service of process or enforce judgments obtained in the united states or bermuda against us or our assets in the jurisdictions in which we or our executive officers operate 
we are organized under the laws of bermuda  and a significant portion of our assets are located outside the united states 
it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the united states against us in bermuda or in countries  other than the united states  where we have assets based on the civil liability or penal provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states 
in addition  there is some doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda and other countries would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liability or penal provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states or would hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws 
we have been advised by appleby  our bermuda counsel  that the united states and bermuda do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not based solely on united states federal or state securities laws  would not automatically be enforceable in bermuda 
similarly  those judgments may not be enforceable in countries  other than the united states  where we have assets

overview we are a leader in the globalization of services and technology and a pioneer in managing business processes for companies around the world 
we began in as the india based captive business process services operation for ge capital  ge s financial services business 
as the value of offshore outsourcing was demonstrated to the management of ge  it became a widespread practice at ge and our business grew in size and scope 
we took on a wide range of complex and critical processes and we became a significant provider to many of ge s businesses  including consumer finance ge money  commercial finance  insurance  healthcare  industrial  nbc universal and ge s corporate offices 
prior to december   the business of the company was conducted through various entities and divisions of ge 
on december   in a series of transactions we refer to as the reorganization  ge reorganized these operations by placing them all under genpact global holdings  a newly formed luxembourg entity  and subsequently an affiliate of ge sold an indirect interest in that entity to general atlantic and oak hill 
see item business the company the reorganization 
since the reorganization  affiliates of ge have sold a portion of its equity in us pursuant to several separate transactions 
as of december   ge through its affiliates owned approximately of our outstanding equity 

table of contents following the reorganization  we began operating as an independent company 
we separated ourselves operationally from ge and began building the capabilities necessary to be successful as an independent company 
among other things  we expanded our management infrastructure and business development capabilities so that we could secure business from clients other than ge 
we substantially expanded administrative functions for which we had previously relied primarily on ge  such as finance  legal  accounting and human resources 
we created separate employee benefit and retirement plans  developed our own leadership training capability and enhanced our management information systems 
we began actively pursuing business from global clients as of january  since that time  we have succeeded in increasing our business and diversifying our revenue sources 
as a result  our net revenues from global clients have increased from million in to million in and million in  representing a compound annual growth rate  or cagr  of approximately 
see classification of certain net revenues for an explanation of the classification of revenues related to businesses once owned by ge and subsequently sold 
during the same period  we increased our net revenues from ge 
our net revenues from ge were million in  million in and million in  respectively  representing a cagr of approximately 
we have increased our business from both ge and global clients such that total net revenues have increased from million in to million in and billion in  representing a cagr of 
see classification of certain net revenues 
our net revenues from global clients as a percentage of total net revenues have increased from in to in and in on july   prior to the commencement of our initial public offering  we completed a series of transactions we refer to as the reorganization 
see the reorganization below 
on august   we commenced an initial public offering of our common shares  pursuant to which the company and our selling shareholders sold million common shares at a price of per share 
the offering resulted in gross proceeds of million and net proceeds to the company and the selling shareholders of approximately million each after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
additionally  the company incurred offering related expenses of approximately million 
on august   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase million additional common shares from the company at the initial offering price of per share to cover over allotments resulting in additional gross proceeds of million and net proceeds of approximately million to the company  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
current economic crisis 
the united states and global economies are experiencing a period of substantial economic uncertainty with wide ranging effects  including contraction of overall economic activity in various parts of the world 
although governments worldwide  including the us government  have initiated sweeping economic plans  we are unable to predict the impact  severity and duration of these economic events 
while we have been relatively unaffected to date by the current macroeconomic conditions  our outlook is subject to significant risks and uncertainties in this environment  including possible declines in demand for our services  pricing pressure  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and risks relating to the financial condition of our clients 
revenues 
we earn revenues pursuant to contracts which generally take the form of a master service agreement  or msa  which is a framework agreement that is then supplemented by statements of work  or sows 
our msas specify the general terms applicable to the services we will provide 
they are typically for terms of five to seven years  although they may also have an indefinite term 
in most cases they do not specify pricing terms or obligate the client to purchase a particular amount of services 
we then enter into sows under an msa  which specify particular services to be provided and the pricing terms 
most of our sows have terms of two to five years 
we typically have multiple sows under any given msa  and the terms of the sows vary depending on the nature of the services provided 

table of contents in connection with the reorganization  we entered into an msa with ge  which governs sows for the services we were then providing to ge as well as new sows entered into thereafter 
since january   we have entered into msas with more than new global clients 
some of these relationships are at an early stage and we are just beginning to perform services for such clients 
therefore  while we believe we have significant opportunities under these contracts  we have only limited experience with which to judge the success of the terms we have established in such contracts 
we seek to develop long term relationships with our clients 
we believe that these relationships offer the greatest potential for benefits to our clients and to us as they create opportunities for us to provide a variety of services using the full range of our capabilities and to deliver continuous process improvement 
we typically face a long selling cycle in securing a new client 
it is not unusual for us to spend twelve months or more from the time we begin actively soliciting a new client until we begin to recognize revenues 
our sales efforts usually involve four phases 
we may make an initial sales effort in response to an invitation by a client  a specific request for a proposal or at our own initiative 
this may be followed by a second phase  during which we work with the client to determine the exact scope and nature of the required services  the proposed solutions and initial transition planning 
it is typically only upon the completion of this second phase that a client would decide to retain us 
a third phase follows which would involve negotiating the msa  as well as the initial sows 
this third phase would also involve detailed planning of the transition of the services as well as the transfer of the knowledge needed to implement the services under such sows 
the final phase involves commencement of the work and ramping up to meet the agreed upon service levels 
we expend significant time and capital throughout all of these phases 
we generally do not recognize any revenues or reimbursement of costs until an msa and one or more sows are signed  which  as noted above  usually occurs sometime in the third phase of the client development effort 
we typically begin hiring employees specifically for the services to be provided to a client once the sow for the services is signed 
because there is no certainty that a new client will retain us  and because the time involved in these initial phases is significant and unpredictable  we may incur expenses for a significant period of time without receiving any revenues 
all costs related to contract acquisition are expensed as incurred and classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
once a contract is signed  we defer revenues from the transition of services to our delivery centers  as well as the related cost of revenue 
we recognize such deferred revenues and related cost of revenue over the period during which we expect to benefit from these costs  which is estimated to be three years 
we price our services under a variety of arrangements  including time and materials contracts and  to a lesser extent  fixed price contracts 
when services are priced on a time and materials basis  we charge the client based on full time equivalent  or fte rates for the personnel who will directly perform the services 
the fte rates are determined on an annual basis  vary by category of service delivery personnel and are set at levels to reflect all our costs  including the cost of supervisory personnel and the allocable portion of other costs  and a margin 
in some cases  time and materials contracts are based on hourly rates of the personnel providing the services 
time and materials pricing does not require us to estimate the volume of transactions or other processes that the client expects us to operate 
a small portion of our revenues are derived from fixed price contracts 
our profitability under a fixed price contract  as compared to a time and materials contract  is more dependent on our ability to estimate the number of ftes required to perform the services  the time required to complete the contract and the amount of travel and other expenses that will be incurred in performing that contract 
accordingly  while we may have an opportunity to realize a higher profit  our profitability under each of our fixed price contracts could also be lower than we expect 

table of contents there are a variety of other aspects to our pricing of contracts  many of which represent options from which a client may choose  such as whether the client wants to provide for higher levels of business continuity planning or whether the client wants shared or dedicated support personnel and or infrastructure 
under most of our msas  we are able to share a limited amount of inflation and currency exchange risk when services are priced on a time and materials basis 
many of our msas also provide that  under time and materials based sows  we are entitled to retain a portion of certain productivity benefits we achieve  such as those resulting from being able to provide the same volume of services with fewer ftes 
however  some of our sows require certain minimum productivity benefits to be passed on entirely to our clients 
once an msa and related sow are signed and production of services commences  our revenues and expenses increase as services are ramped up to the agreed upon level 
in many cases  we may have opportunities to increase our margins over the life of an msa and over the life of a particular sow 
this is due to a number of factors 
margins under an msa can improve to the extent that the time and expense involved in negotiating additional sows  transitioning the processes to our delivery centers and starting up production are generally less with respect to additional services provided under an msa than they are with respect to the initial services provided under that msa 
margins under an msa or an sow can improve as a result of the realization of economies of scale as the volume of services increases or the achievement of productivity benefits 
thus  our more mature client relationships typically generate higher margins 
a critical part of our strategy is therefore to expand relationships with our clients as a means to increase our overall revenues and improve our margins 
we follow a rigorous review process to evaluate all new business 
each new business proposal typically is reviewed twice by a committee that includes not only our business development and operational employees  but also members of our finance team 
in this way  we try to ensure that contract terms meet our pricing and service objectives 
see item business our new business review process 
our msa with ge is for a term ending december  under this agreement  subject to certain specified adjustments  ge has agreed to provide a minimum annual volume commitment of million for each of the seven years beginning january   subject to certain potential adjustments or credits 
such minimum annual commitment is then reduced in a phased manner for the final three years of the agreement  to million for  million for and million for however  the actual level of services purchased in the last three years has exceeded the respective minimum annual commitment 
ge has the ability to carry forward surpluses of up to of the excess purchases in any year against the minimum commitment requirements in the subsequent two years 
purchases made by ge affiliates count towards the ge minimum annual volume commitment 
the actual amount of purchases in any given year depends on decisions by a variety of business units  and represents the sum of services ordered under approximately  sows 
our pricing arrangements with ge vary by sow and include some time and materials contracts and some fixed price contracts 
because of our long term relationship with ge  the negotiation and implementation of new sows often occurs in less time than that required for a new client 
our business from ge comes from a variety of ge s businesses and decisions to use our services are currently  as a general matter  made by a number of people within ge 
therefore  although some decisions may be made centrally at ge  the total level of business we receive generally depends on the decisions of the various operating managers of such businesses 
in addition  because our business from ge is derived from a variety of businesses within ge  our exposure to ge is diversified in terms of industry risk 
see item a risk factors ge accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and any loss of business from  or change in our relationship with  ge could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our msa with genworth financial provides a minimum volume commitment of million per year through and declining amounts per year thereafter through most of our other msas 
table of contents do not obligate the client to purchase a specified amount of services 
the volume of services provided to global clients thus depends on the commitments under individual sows 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenses received from clients  consisting principally of travel expenses  have been included as part of net revenues from services 
net revenues represent revenues less certain business taxes we pay in hungary and china 
classification of certain net revenues 
our net revenues are classified as net revenues from a significant shareholder which is ge  net revenues from global clients and other net revenues 
net revenues from global clients consist of revenues from services provided to all clients other than ge and the companies in which ge owns or more of the stock 
revenues from global clients in  and include revenues from certain former ge owned businesses 
these businesses were wholly owned by ge in the beginning of  but ge gradually divested its interest in these businesses in and after ge ceased to own at least of such businesses  we began to treat the revenues from those businesses as global client net revenues  in each case from the date that ge ceased to be a shareholder 
we have continued to perform services for such businesses following their divestiture by ge even though they were not obligated by the ge msa to continue to use our services 
we entered into either new msas with respect to such businesses following its divestment by ge or agreed with the businesses to continue to work pursuant to the terms agreed to by ge 
in addition to our revenues from ge and our revenues from global clients  our genpact mortgage services subsidiary had million in revenues in each of and and nil in from interest income on mortgage loans that it funded directly and held for sale  typically on a short term basis 
the primary activity of this subsidiary  which we acquired in  consists of mortgage loan application processing for mid size financial institutions 
funding and secondary remarketing of loans is not part of our business plan for this unit  and on june  we ceased funding new mortgage loans 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit risk 
expenses 
personnel expenses are the major component of both our cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses 
personnel expenses include salaries and benefits as well as costs related to recruiting  training and retention 
our industry is labor intensive 
wage levels in the countries in which our delivery centers are located have increased in recent years 
we attempt to address the impact of wage increases  and pressures to increase wages  in a number of ways  which include seeking to control entry level wages  managing our attrition rate  and delivering productivity 
we try to control increases in entry level wages by implementing innovative recruiting policies  emphasizing training and promotion opportunities and maintaining an attractive work atmosphere and company culture 
we have succeeded at keeping our entry level wages in india  where most of our employees are located  at a relatively constant level for the past five years  but there is no assurance we can continue to do so 
effective training allows us to expand the pool of potential applicants and to upgrade our employees skill levels so that employees may take on higher value added tasks over time 
by emphasizing training and promotion  we seek to create opportunities for employees to increase their salaries without increasing wage scales 
in planning our expansion of capacity  we look for locations that help us ensure global delivery capability while helping us control average salary levels 
in india and elsewhere where we may open multiple locations  we try to expand into cities where competition for personnel and wage levels may be lower than in more developed cities 
in addition  under some of our contracts we have the ability to share with our clients a portion of any increase in costs due to inflation 
nevertheless  despite these steps  we expect general increases in wage levels in the future which could adversely affect our margins 
a significant increase in attrition rates would also increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins 
increased attrition rates or increased pricing may also cause some clients to be less willing to use our 
table of contents services 
see item a risk factors wage increases in the countries in which we have operations may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
personnel expenses includes compensation  benefits and share options  and are allocated between cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses based on the classification of the employee 
personnel expenses for employees who are directly responsible for performance of services  their supervisors and certain support personnel who may be dedicated to a particular client are included in cost of revenue 
personnel expenses for senior management employees who are not dedicated to a particular client  business development personnel and other personnel involved in support functions are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our operational expenses include facilities maintenance expenses  travel and living costs  communications expenses and other costs 
travel and living costs  which represent the costs of travel  accommodation and meals of employees while traveling for business  are allocated between cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses based on the allocation of the personnel expenses of the employee incurring such costs 
facilities maintenance  certain communication costs and certain other operational costs are allocated between cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses in the same proportions as the allocation of our employees by headcount 
our depreciation and amortization expense is similarly allocated by headcount 
cost of revenue 
the principal component of cost of revenue is personnel expenses 
we include in cost of revenue all personnel expenses for employees who are directly responsible for the performance of services  their supervisors and certain support personnel who may be dedicated to a particular client 
stock based compensation is allocated between cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses based on the function to which the employee belongs 
the operational expenses included in cost of revenue include a portion of our facilities maintenance expenses  travel and living expenses  communication expenses and certain other expenses 
as noted above  facilities maintenance expenses  certain communication expenses and certain other expenses are allocated between cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses based on headcount 
travel and living expenses are included in cost of revenue if the personnel expense for the employee incurring such expense is included in cost of revenue 
the operational expenses component of cost of revenue also includes consulting charges  which represent the cost of third party software and other consultants that we may retain for particular services 
cost of revenue also includes a portion of our depreciation and amortization expense  which is allocated between cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses based on headcount 
the ratio of cost of revenue to revenues for any particular sow or for all sows under an msa is typically higher in the early periods of the contract or client relationship than in later periods 
this is because the number of supervisory and support personnel relative to the number of employees who are performing services declines 
it is also because we may retain a portion of the benefit of productivity increases realized over time 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses are primarily comprised of personnel expenses for senior management  business development personnel and other personnel who are not dedicated to particular clients 
stock based compensation is allocated between cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses based on the function to which the employee belongs 
the operational costs component of sg a expenses includes travel and living costs for such personnel  as well as a portion of our total facilities maintenance expenses  certain communication expenses and certain other expenses 
such portion of such costs is equal to the percentage of our total employees  by headcount  whose compensation cost is classified as sg a expenses 
the operational costs component of sg a expenses also includes professional fees  which represent the costs of third party legal  tax  accounting and other advisors  and a bad debt valuation allowance 
sg a expenses also include a portion of our depreciation and amortization expense  which is allocated between cost of revenue and sg a expenses based on headcount 

table of contents the percentage of net revenue represented by our sg a expenses increased significantly in and in connection with the separation of our company from ge and the expansion and diversification of our client base 
in addition  during  sg a as a percentage of net revenue increased  largely due to various professional fees  including fees relating to acquisition activities and being a public company 
during  sg a as a percentage of net revenue decreased  largely due to limiting the growth in support costs and discretionary spending 
as discussed above  since january   we expanded various administrative and support functions we needed to operate as an independent company 
we also enhanced our business development capabilities 
in certain areas  we scaled up our operations in advance of securing new business  so that we would have the infrastructure and support capable of managing the new business 
as a public company  we also incur expenses in relation to compliance with the provisions of the united states securities laws  including in particular the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as stock exchange requirements  which are included as sg a expenses 
foreign exchange gains losses  net 
foreign exchange gains losses  net  primarily consist of gains or losses on re measurement of non functional currency assets 
in addition  this includes  gains or losses on account of derivative contracts taken to offset the impact of this re measurement of non functional currency assets 
it does not include the gains or losses on derivative contracts acquired to mitigate foreign currency exposure related to our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenditures and which qualify for hedge accounting or cash flow hedges 
these gains or losses are deferred and included as other accumulated comprehensive income loss until such time as the derivative contracts mature where then the gains or losses on the cash flow hedges are classified as cost of revenue and selling general and administrative expenses based on the underlying risk being hedged 
see note to our consolidated financial statements and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
approximately of our revenues were earned in us dollars in fiscal we also received payments in euros  uk pounds sterling  australian dollars  chinese renminbi and japanese yen 
our costs are primarily in indian rupees  as well as in us dollars  chinese renminbi  romanian leu  euro and the currencies of the other countries in which we have operations 
while many of our contracts provide for limited sharing of the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we bear a substantial part of this risk  and therefore our operating results could be negatively affected by adverse changes in wage inflation rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
see discussion of wage inflation under expenses above 
we enter into forward currency contracts to hedge most of our indian rupee us dollar  mexican rupee us dollar  philippines rupee us dollar  euro us dollar  euro romanian leu  euro hungarian forint  pound sterling us dollar  australian sterling us dollar and our chinese renminbi japanese yen currency exposure  which are generally designed to qualify for hedge accounting 
however  our ability to hedge such risks is limited by local law  the liquidity of the market for such hedges and other practical considerations 
thus  our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are not able to enter into the desired hedging arrangements or if our hedging strategies are not successful 
the realized gain or loss on derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting is classified as cost of revenue and sg a based on the underlying risk being hedged 
the effective portion of the mark to market gains and losses on qualifying hedges is deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the transactions occur and is then recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
our foreign exchange gains losses  net  includes the mark to market gain or loss on other derivatives excluding interest rate swaps 
other income expense 
other income expense  net consists primarily of interest expense on indebtedness 
it also includes realized and unrealized gain or loss on interest rate swaps 
we have entered into interest rate swaps with respect to the floating rate interest exposure on our long term debt 
other income expense also includes interest income on intercorporate and other deposits 

table of contents income taxes 
we are incorporated in bermuda and have operations in many countries 
our effective tax rate has varied and will  in the future  vary from year to year based on the tax rate in our jurisdiction of organization  the geographical source of our revenues and the tax rates in those countries  the tax relief and incentives available to us  the financing and tax planning strategies employed by us  changes in tax law or interpretation thereof and movements in our tax reserves  if any 
bermuda and luxembourg taxes 
since the reorganization  our parent company has been organized in bermuda 
see the reorganization below 
bermuda does not impose any income tax on us 
from december  until the consummation of the reorganization  the predecessor to our parent company  genpact global holdings  or ggh  was organized in luxembourg  as an investment company in risk capital  in the form of a private limited liability company or sicar s rl under the law dated june  of the grand duchy of luxembourg  or the sicar law 
under the sicar law  ggh was not subject to income tax on any income attributable to its investments in its subsidiaries and other income attributable to investments in risk capital and was not required to withhold any taxes on distributions paid to its shareholders 
indian taxes 
under the indian income tax act   our delivery centers in india  from which we derived approximately of our revenues in fiscal  benefit from a ten year holiday from indian corporate income taxes in respect of their export income as defined in the legislation under the software technology parks of india stpi scheme 
as a result of this tax holiday  prior to we incurred minimal income tax expense with respect to our indian operations 
in the absence of this tax holiday  income derived from our indian operations would be taxed up to the maximum tax rate generally applicable to indian enterprises  which  as of december   was the tax holiday enjoyed by our delivery centers in india under the stpi scheme expires in stages 
our tax holiday partially expired on march  in respect of approximately of our indian operations and on march  in respect of approximately of our indian operations and will further expire on march  in respect of approximately of our indian operations  depending in each case on when each delivery center commenced operations 
the tax holiday in respect of the balance of our indian operations will expire on march  as the stpi tax holiday expires  our indian tax expense will materially increase and our after tax profitability will be materially reduced  unless we can obtain comparable benefits under new legislation or otherwise reduce our tax liability 
the sez legislation introduced a separate new year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated special economic zones  or sezs 
under the sez legislation  qualifying operations are eligible for a deduction from taxable income equal to i of their profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from the commencement of operations  ii of such profits or gains for the next five years  and iii of such profits or gains for a further five years  subject to the creation of a special economic zone re investment reserve account  to be utilized only for acquiring new plant or machinery  or for other business purposes not including the distribution of dividends 
this holiday is available only for new business operations that are conducted at qualifying sez locations and is not available to operations formed by splitting up or reconstructing existing operations or transferring existing technology infrastructure to new locations 
see item a risk factors over the next few years we will lose certain tax benefits provided by india to companies in our industry and it is not clear whether new tax policies will provide equivalent benefits and incentives 
during  we established new delivery centers that we expect to be eligible for the sez benefits 
it is not clear  however  what percentage of our operations or income in india is eligible for sez benefits  as this will depend on how much of our business can be conducted at the qualifying locations and how much of that business can be considered to meet the restrictive conditions described above 
in  we signed agreements with certain developers and local governments to purchase and or lease qualifying sez property 
our first sez unit also became operational during in a 
table of contents leased facility 
however  because this is new legislation  there is continuing uncertainty as to the interpretation of the required governmental and regulatory approvals 
this uncertainty may delay development of our proposed sez locations 
the government of india may assert that certain of our clients have a permanent establishment in india by reason of the activities we perform on their behalf  particularly those clients that exercise control over or have substantial dependency on our services 
such an assertion could affect the size and scope of the services requested by such clients in the future 
during  the government of india enacted a fringe benefit tax on the exercise of share options granted to employees based in india 
this tax is payable by the issuer of the share options and recoverable at the option of the issuer from its employees 
depending on the number of options exercised by our employees  this tax may materially and adversely impact our results of operations  although it would not affect cash flow if fully recovered from employees as has been our general practice to date 
transfer pricing 
we have transfer pricing arrangements among our subsidiaries involved in various aspects of our business  including operations  marketing  sales and delivery functions 
us and indian transfer pricing regulations  as well as the regulations applicable in the other countries in which we operate  require that any international transaction involving affiliated enterprises be made on arm s length terms 
we consider the transactions among our subsidiaries to be substantially on arm s length pricing terms 
if  however  a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and determines that the transfer prices we have applied are not appropriate  or that other income of our affiliates should be taxed in that jurisdiction  we may incur increased tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties  which would cause our tax expense to increase  possibly materially  thereby reducing our profitability and cash flows 
other taxes 
we have operating subsidiaries in other countries  including china  hungary  mexico  the netherlands  the philippines  romania  spain  the united kingdom and the united states  as well as sales and marketing subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions including the united states and the united kingdom  which are subject to tax in such jurisdictions 
we have moved certain of our marketing operations from luxembourg to the united states effective january   which may result in an increase in taxes on income attributable to such operations 
the government of china recently enacted amendments to the tax laws applicable to our operations that may increase the applicable tax rate from to 
depending upon the growth of our business in china  the effect on our overall tax rate could be material 
effective january   the government of mexico enacted the ietu tax  or flat tax 
a presidential decree was issued in  which mitigates the impact of the flat tax on the maquiladora industry in which we operate in mexico 
the flat tax does not currently have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
our ability to repatriate surplus earnings from our delivery centers in a tax efficient manner is dependent upon interpretations of local law  possible changes in such laws and the renegotiation of existing double tax avoidance treaties 
changes to any of these may adversely affect our overall tax rate 
tax audits 
our tax liabilities may also increase  including due to accrued interest and penalties  if the applicable income tax authorities in any jurisdiction  during the course of any audits  were to disagree with any of our tax return positions 
through the period ended december   we have an indemnity from ge for any additional taxes attributable to periods prior to the reorganization 
the reorganization as noted above  the reorganization was consummated on december   pursuant to which we became an independent company 
the reorganization has been accounted for under 
table of contents the purchase method under sfas  business combinations which resulted in a new basis of accounting 
the total purchase consideration was million 
the allocation of the total consideration to the fair values of the net assets acquired resulted in goodwill of million and intangible assets of million 
the intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from years 
as a result  for periods after december   we have had  and will continue to have  significant non cash charges related to the amortization of such intangible assets 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the reorganization  we incurred indebtedness of million  of which million was paid to various ge entities to acquire the operations in india  mexico  china  the united states and elsewhere that then constituted our business 
prior to the reorganization  the financial statements of the various entities were presented on a combined basis as all the entities were under the common control of ge 
because the application of purchase accounting in connection with the reorganization created a new basis of accounting  the financial statements and financial data in this annual report for periods prior to the reorganization are not directly comparable to those for periods after december  see also note to our consolidated financial statements 
the reorganization genpact limited was incorporated in bermuda on march  as a subsidiary of ggh with the intent of making it the new holding company of our business 
on july   genpact limited effectuated a transaction that resulted in the shareholders of ggh exchanging their common shares in ggh for common shares of genpact limited  and the shareholders of genpact global lux s rl  or ggl  exchanging their preferred and common shares in ggl for common shares of genpact limited 
as a result  genpact limited became the owner of all the capital stock of ggl and ggh 
pursuant to the above transaction  the ownership interests of the shareholders of ggh  including the minority shareholders  were exchanged for shares of genpact limited irrespective of whether such shareholders owned equity directly in ggh or indirectly through ggl 
such shareholders acquired the same proportionate economic interest in genpact limited as they had in ggh immediately prior to the reorganization 
accordingly  the interest of the existing shareholders in ggh continued to be same in the company before and after the reorganization 
the above legal reorganization of ggh and ggl into the company has been accounted for as a transfer of net assets or exchange of equity interests between entities under common control 
accordingly  the assets and liabilities transferred are recorded at their carrying value in a manner similar to the as if pooling of interest accounting 
since the accounts of these entities were stated at their historical amounts for all periods presented  no adjustments were required for purposes of restating the financial statements on a consolidated basis for the current and the prior periods 
as part of the reorganization  ggh became a bermuda company and its name changed to genpact global holdings bermuda limited 
in addition  ggl also became a bermuda company  in accordance with the laws of bermuda and luxembourg and its name changed to genpact global bermuda limited 
the effect of the exchange of common shares of the company in the reorganization with the common shares of ggh has been retrospectively applied to stockholders equity and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
this retrospective application had no material effect on other amounts 
the effect of the exchange of preferred shares in the reorganization has been applied to stockholders equity and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the reorganization 
the accompanying financial statements reflect the reorganization as a change in reporting entity genpact limited at historical cost for purposes of the rules and regulations of the sec 

table of contents acquisitions from time to time we may make acquisitions or engage in other strategic transactions if suitable opportunities arise  and we may use cash  securities or other assets as consideration 
in december  we acquired axis risk consulting services private limited  a risk consulting firm providing a variety of risk assurance services  for cash consideration of indian rupees  approximately million and  common shares of the company 
genpact has the right to repurchase up to  of the common shares issued as part of the purchase consideration at per share if any of the axis sellers now employed by genpact cease to be genpact employees at any time prior to march  the fair value of the remaining  common shares issued to the axis sellers was million as of december the total purchase consideration amounted to million including acquisition related expenses and cash acquired 
in march  we acquired e transparent bv and certain related entities  which are controlling partners in a partnership known as ice  a sap enterprise solution provider  for cash consideration of euro million approximately million and  common shares of the company with an estimated fair value as of march of million 
the total purchase consideration amounted to million including acquisition related expenses and cash acquired 
certain partners  which we refer to as the continuing partners  retained an equity interest in ice 
as a result there is a minority interest in our income statement commencing with the first quarter of  the size of which varies from period to period depending on the contribution of ice to our results as well as the portion of the ice business that relates to the continuing partners activities 
in connection with the ice transaction we were obligated to pay the sellers of e transparent bv and related entities an additional cash amount in not to exceed euro million if certain profitability targets were met 
in may  as a result of the profitability targets being achieved  we agreed with the sellers of ice that additional consideration of euro million approximately million would be paid to the sellers of ice on february   and such amount was paid 
in august  we acquired moneyline lending services  inc now called genpact mortgage services  a provider of mortgage origination and fulfillment services  for cash consideration of approximately million 
the sale agreement with the sellers of genpact mortgage services provides that an additional cash amount  not to exceed million  is payable in if certain revenue and profitability targets are met

all four acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of these acquisitions are reflected in our financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the notes to the financial statements contain a summary of our significant accounting policies 
set forth below are our critical accounting policies under us gaap 
revenue recognition 
as discussed previously  we derive revenues from our services which are provided on a time and materials and a fixed price basis 
revenues derived from time and materials contracts are recognized as the related services are performed 
in the case of fixed price contracts  including those for application maintenance and support services  revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
revenues with respect to fixed price contracts for development of software are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
guidance has been drawn from paragraph of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  
table of contents software revenue recognition  to account for revenue from fixed price arrangements for software development and related services in conformity with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
this method of revenue recognition has been used because management considers this to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts as there is a direct relation between input and productivity 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the current contract estimates 
for our time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue from services when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
if we receive a cash payment in respect of services prior to the time a contract is signed  we recognize this as an advance from a client until such time as the contract is signed  it becomes revenue to the extent the services are rendered 
some customer contracts can also include incentive payments for benefits delivered to clients 
revenues relating to such incentive payments are recorded when the contingency is satisfied and we conclude that the amounts are earned 
we defer the revenues that are for the transition of services to our delivery centers which revenues may include reimbursement of transition costs and the related costs over the period during which we expect to benefit from these costs  which is currently estimated to be three years 
further  the deferred costs are limited to the amount of the deferred revenues 
revenues are reported net of value added tax  business tax and applicable discounts and allowances 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenses received from clients have been included as part of revenues in accordance with eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
our accounts receivable include amounts for services that we have performed and for which an invoice has not yet been issued to the client 
we follow a day billing cycle and  as such  there may be at any point in time up to days of revenues which we have accrued but not yet billed 
these are disclosed as part of accounts receivable 
business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas no 
specifies criteria as to intangible assets acquired in a business combination that must be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  all assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses including goodwill are assigned to reporting units 
goodwill represents the cost of the acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets purchased 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis on september  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
recoverability of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

table of contents intangible assets acquired individually  or with a group of other assets in a business combination  are carried at a cost less accumulated amortization based on their estimated useful lives as follows customer related intangible assets years marketing related intangible assets years contract related intangible assets year other intangible assets years intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on inter company transactions and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies and interest rate risk 
certain of these transactions meet the criteria for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we designate derivative contracts as cash flow hedges if they satisfy the criteria for hedge accounting under sfas no 
changes in the fair values of these hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income losses  net of tax until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the statement of income 
changes in the fair value for other derivative contracts and the ineffective portion of hedging instruments are recognized in the statement of income of each period and are included in foreign exchange gains losses  net and other income expense  net  respectively 
we value our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies 
derivative assets and liabilities included in level primarily represent foreign currency forward contracts 
the quotes are taken from multiple independent sources including financial institutions 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions with respect to derivatives designated as hedges 
in addition  we formally assess both at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item 
if it is determined that a derivative or a portion thereof is not highly effective as a hedge  or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  we will prospectively discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative is retained  we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet and recognize any subsequent change in its fair value in the consolidated statement of income 
when it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  we discontinue the hedge accounting and recognize immediately in the consolidated statement of income the gains and losses attributable to such derivative that were accumulated in other comprehensive income 
income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses carried forward  if any 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using legislatively enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the legislative enactment date 
deferred tax assets are recognized in full  subject to a valuation allowance that reduces the amount recognized to that which is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider estimates of future taxable income 
in the case of an entity which benefits from a corporate tax holiday  deferred tax assets or liabilities for 
table of contents existing temporary differences are recorded only to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse after the expiration of the tax holiday 
we also evaluate potential exposures related to tax contingencies or claims made by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions and determine if a reserve is required 
a reserve is recorded if we believe that a loss is more likely than not and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these reserves are based on estimates and subject to changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing audits  case law and new legislation 
we believe that the reserves established are adequate in relation to any possible additional tax assessments 
we plan to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries or have the ability to repatriate in a tax free manner and  accordingly  do not accrue any income  distribution or withholding taxes that would arise if such earnings were repatriated 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on january  fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
upon adoption of fin  our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income tax expense did not change 
retirement benefits 
contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to consolidated statements of income in the period in which services are rendered by the covered employees 
current service costs for defined benefit plans are accrued in the period to which they relate 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the liability in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated annually by the company using the projected amount credit method 
prior service cost  if any  resulting from an amendment to a plan is recognized and amortized over the remaining period of service of the covered employees 
we recognize the liabilities for compensated absences in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for compensated absences

effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  following the prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards based on the grant date fair value determined under the black scholes model of those awards 
upon adopting sfas no 
r  we began to recognize compensation expense for stock options net of estimated forfeitures 
stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the years ended december   and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
as a result the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r required forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
under the prospective transition method  the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 

table of contents prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  we followed the minimum value method of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to account for its stock based awards 
under this method  compensation expense was recorded on the date of grant if the fair value of the underlying stock on date of grant exceeded the present value of the stock options on the date of grant 
we amortize the cost using the accelerated method of cost recognition 
as required under the prospective transition method  for the portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application of sfas no 
r  the company continues to apply the minimum value method 
for awards granted after the adoption of sfas r  we elected to amortize the compensation cost on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
effective april   an amendment was made in the proviso of section wb of the indian income tax act to subject specified securities allotted or transferred by an employer to its employees resident in india to fringe benefit tax  or fbt 
the employer liability for fbt arises at the time securities are issued to the employee upon exercise of a stock option 
the employer may collect the fbt payable in connection with a stock option exercise from the relevant employees 
the amount collected from the employee is deemed to increase the exercise price payable by the employee 
reclassification in order to more clearly reflect our costs  including the impact of our long term foreign exchange hedging strategy  we have reclassified our foreign exchange gains or losses from a separate line item above income from operations to the underlying hedged items  namely  selling  general and administrative expenses  cost of revenue or net revenues  as applicable

goodwill impairment testing we test goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis on september goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
determining whether an impairment has occurred requires valuation of the respective reporting units  which we estimate using the discounted cash flow method 
valuation of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions which we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain and accordingly actual results may differ from these estimates 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions 
the results of our evaluation as of september   showed that the fair values of all our reporting units exceeded their book values 
as a result of the changes in the global economy that occurred during  we have performed an evaluation of potential impairment as at december  for events and conditions identified in accordance with the guidance in paragraph of sfas no

observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
these two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable

 equity method investment accounting considerations 
eitf continues to follow the accounting for the initial carrying value of equity method investments in apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  which is based on a cost accumulation model and generally excludes contingent consideration 
eitf also specifies that other than temporary impairment testing by the investor should be performed at the investment level and that a separate impairment assessment of the underlying assets is not required 
an impairment charge by the investee should result in an adjustment of the investor s basis of the impaired asset for the investor s pro rata share of such impairment 
in addition  eitf reached a consensus on how to account for an issuance of shares by an investee that reduces the investor s ownership share of the investee 
an investor should account for such transactions as if it had sold a proportionate share of its investment with any gains or losses recorded through earnings 
eitf also addresses the accounting for a change in an investment from the equity method to the cost method after adoption of statement eitf affirms the existing guidance in apb  which requires cessation of the equity method of accounting and application of fasb statement no
