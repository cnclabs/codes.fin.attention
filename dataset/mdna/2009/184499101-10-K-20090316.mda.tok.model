we provide natural gas solutions for vehicle fleets primarily in the united states and canada 
in april  we opened our first cng station in lima  peru  through our joint venture  clean energy del peru 
our primary business activity is selling cng and lng vehicle fuels and providing operations and maintenance services to our customers 
we also build fueling stations and help our customers acquire and finance natural gas vehicles and obtain local  state and federal clean air financial and tax incentives 
our customers include fleet operators in a variety of markets  such as public transit  refuse hauling  airports  taxis and regional trucking 
in august  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of dallas clean energy  llc dce 
dce owns a facility that collects  processes and sells renewable biomethane at the mccommas bluff landfill located in dallas  texas 
overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
sources of revenue 
we generate the vast majority of our revenue from selling cng and lng and providing operations and maintenance services to our customers 
the balance of our revenue is provided by designing and constructing natural gas fueling stations  financing our customers natural gas vehicle purchases and sales of pipeline quality biomethane produced by our dce joint venture 
key operating data 
in evaluating our operating performance  our management focuses primarily on the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents delivered which we define as i the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents we sell to our customers  plus ii the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents dispensed to our customers at stations where we provide o m services but do not directly sell the cng or lng  plus iii our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents sold as cng by our joint venture in peru  plus iv our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents of biomethane produced and sold as pipeline quality natural gas by dce  our revenue  our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and net income loss 
the following table  which you should read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this form k  presents our key operating data for the years ended december   and year ended december  gasoline gallon equivalents delivered in millions cng biomethane lng total operating data revenue ebitda net loss key trends in  and according to the us energy information administration  demand for natural gas fuels in the united states increased by approximately during the period january  through december  we believe this growth in demand was attributable primarily to the rising prices of gasoline and diesel relative to cng and lng during these periods and increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets 
the number of fueling stations we served grew from at december  to at december  a increase 
included in this number are all of the cng and lng fueling stations we own  maintain or have a fueling supply contract with 
the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents we delivered from to increased by 
the increase in gasoline gallon equivalents delivered  together with higher prices we charged our customers due to higher natural gas prices  contributed to increased revenues during these periods 
our cost of sales also increased during these periods  which was attributable primarily to increased costs related to delivering more cng and lng to our customers and the increased price of natural gas 
during  prices for oil  gasoline  diesel fuel and natural gas experienced significant volatility and substantial price declines by the end of oil declined from a high of per barrel on july  to a price of per barrel on december  in california  average retail prices for gasoline have declined from a high of per gallon in june of to per gallon at december  and average retail prices for diesel fuel have declined from a high of per diesel gallon in may and june of to per diesel gallon at december  to the extent that we continue to try to price lng and cng at a discount to these lower diesel and gasoline prices in an effort to attract new and retain existing customers  our revenue and profit margin on fuel sales may be lower 
in addition  the volatility in natural gas prices has a direct impact on our revenue 
the nymex price for natural gas declined from over per mmbtu in july to around per mmbtu at the end of december our sales revenue from biomethane produced by dce  which from august  through december  was sold based on an index price for natural gas  has had a corresponding drop due to the lower natural gas prices 
the average retail sales price of our cng fuel sold in the los angeles metropolitan area declined from for the month of july to for the month of december continuing declines in natural gas prices would lead to further revenue reduction and potentially lower profit margins on our fuel sales 
in addition  reduction in our accounts receivable balances at certain of our subsidiaries due to decreased natural gas prices may result in violation of one of our debt covenants under our credit agreement with plainscapital bank  as is further described in liquidity and capital resources below 
anticipated future trends 
despite the recent volatility and decline in energy prices  we anticipate that  over the long term  the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel  and more stringent emissions requirements will continue to make natural gas vehicles an attractive alternative to traditional gasoline and diesel powered vehicles 
our belief that natural gas will continue  over the long term  to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in part on the growth in us natural gas production 
a navigant consulting  inc study indicates that as a result of new unconventional gas shale discoveries from basins in the us  maximum estimates of total recoverable domestic reserves from producers have increased to equal years of us production at producing rates 
the study indicated a mean level of reserves equal to years of supply at production levels 
indications were that shale gas production growth from only the major six shale plays  plus marcellus could become billion cubic feet per day and as high as billion cubic feet per day by navigant has also indicated that development of the shale resources base has resulted in a substantial current surplus of gas supply compared to demand of as much as billion cubic feet per day 
these current surplus levels are of annual average historical us consumption levels of approximately tcf per year making available gas supply to meet all existing markets and to meet new market requirements 
analysts believe that there is a significant worldwide supply of natural gas relative to crude oil as well 
according to the bp statistical review of world energy  on a global basis  the ratio of proven natural gas reserves to natural gas production was greater than the ratio of proven crude oil reserves to crude oil production 
this analysis suggests significantly greater longer term availability of natural gas than crude oil based on current consumption 
we believe there will be significant growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among vehicle fleets  and our goal is to capitalize on this trend and enhance our leadership position as this market expands 
we have built a natural gas fueling station  and plan to build additional natural gas fueling stations  that will provide lng to fleet vehicles at the ports of los angeles and long beach 
we also anticipate expanding our sales of cng and lng in the other markets in which we operate  including public transit  refuse hauling and airports 
consistent with the anticipated growth of our business  we also expect that our operating costs and capital expenditures will increase  primarily from the anticipated expansion of our station network as well as the logistics of delivering more cng and lng to our customers 
additionally  we have and will continue to increase our sales and marketing team and other necessary personnel as we seek to expand our existing markets and enter new markets  which will also result in increased costs 
in addition  the economic recession that began during has resulted in decreased demand for vehicle fuel generally  which has reduced our sales of lng and cng fuel 
the disruption in the capital markets that began during and has continued into has made it more difficult for new customers to finance or invest in natural gas vehicle acquisitions 
continuing economic contraction and reduced economic activity may reduce our opportunities to attract new fleet customers 
many governmental entities  which during through represented approximately two thirds or our revenues  are experiencing significant budget deficits as a result of the economic recession and may be unable to invest in new natural gas vehicles for their transit or refuse fleets or may be compelled to reduce public transportation and services  which would negatively affect our business 
sources of liquidity and anticipated capital expenditures 
in may  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
historically  our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  capital contributions from our stockholders  our cash and cash equivalents and  during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  a revolving line of credit with boone pickens  a director and our largest stockholder 
the line of credit was used to fund margin requirements on certain derivative contracts and was terminated in december in connection with our acquisition of of the membership interests in dce  we entered into a credit agreement on august  with plainscapital bank 
we borrowed million to finance the acquisition and entered into a million line of credit from plainscapital bank to provide capital to dce  primarily for capital expenditures  and to pay certain costs and expenses of the acquisition and the loans 
as of march  approximately million is available under the line of credit from plainscapital bank to provide further capital to dce 
on september   we sold  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share to boone pickens interests  ltd 
for proceeds of approximately million 
on november  we sold  shares of common stock and warrants exercisable for common stock to third party investors and received net proceeds of approximately million 
see note to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the november  transaction and description of the outstanding warrants 
our current business plan calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations 
in addition  we anticipate that during we will provide approximately million for financing natural gas vehicle purchases by our customers and up to million in funding that we may be required to provide to the vehicle production group  llc  a company that is developing cng paratransit vehicles and taxis 
we anticipate that we will fund any capital expenditures of dce during through our line of credit from plainscapital bank 
we may also elect to invest additional amounts in expansion of our california lng plant  station construction for new or existing customers that are not currently under contract  or for other acquisitions or investments in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund expansion of our california lng plant  additional station construction  acquisitions or other capital expenditures or investments which are not budgeted for in our business plan 
if we do need to raise additional capital  the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend primarily on our rate of new station construction and any decision to expand our california lng plant 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources below 
due to the continuing disruption in the capital markets  we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and reduce our ability to grow our business and generate increased revenues 
volatility in operating results related to futures contracts 
historically  we have purchased futures contracts from time to time to help mitigate our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations in current periods and in future periods 
gains and losses related to our futures activities  which appear in the line item derivative gains losses in our consolidated financial statements  have materially impacted our results of operations in recent periods 
for the years ended december   and  derivative gains losses were  and  respectively 
for this reason and others  we caution investors that our past operating results may not be indicative of future results 
for more information  please read volatility of earnings and cash flows and risk management activities below 
business risks and uncertainties 
our business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties 
for more information  see risk factors in part i  item a 
operations we generate revenues principally by selling cng and lng and providing operations and maintenance services to our vehicle fleet customers 
for the year ended december   cng and biomethane together represented and lng represented of our natural gas sales on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis 
to a lesser extent  we generate revenues by designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing those stations to our customers 
substantially all of our operating and maintenance revenues are generated from cng stations  as owners of lng stations tend to operate and maintain their own stations 
substantially all of our station sale and leasing revenues have been generated from cng stations 
in  we began providing vehicle finance services to our customers 
cng sales we sell cng through fueling stations located on our customers properties and through our network of public access fueling stations 
at these cng fueling stations  we procure natural gas from local utilities or brokers under standard  floating rate arrangements and then compress and dispense it into our customers vehicles 
our cng sales are made primarily through contracts with our fleet customers 
under these contracts  pricing is determined primarily on an index plus basis  which is calculated by adding a margin to the local index or utility price for natural gas 
we sell a small amount of cng under fixed price contracts and also provide price caps to certain customers on their index plus pricing arrangement 
effective january   we ceased offering price cap contracts to our customers  but we will continue to perform our obligations under price cap contracts we entered into before january  we will continue to offer fixed price contracts as appropriate and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy that was revised in may our fleet customers typically are billed monthly based on the volume of cng sold at a station 
the remainder of our cng sales are on a per fill up basis at prices we set at the pump based on prevailing market conditions 
these customers typically pay using a credit card at the station 
in april  we opened our first cng station in lima  peru through our joint venture clean energy del peru 
lng sales we sell substantially all of our lng to fleet customers  who typically own and operate their fueling stations 
we also sell a small volume of lng to customers for non vehicle use 
we procure lng from third party producers and also produce lng at our liquefaction plants in texas and california 
for lng that we purchase from third parties  we typically enter into take or pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of lng at index based rates 
we deliver lng via our fleet of tanker trailers to fueling stations  where it is stored and dispensed in liquid form into vehicles 
we sell lng principally through supply contracts that are priced on either a fixed price or index plus basis 
we also provided price caps to certain customers on the index component of their index plus pricing arrangement for certain contracts we entered into on or prior to december  effective january   we ceased offering price cap contracts to our customers  but we will continue to perform our obligations under price cap contracts we entered into before january   including two one year renewal periods beginning april  that one of our customers is entitled to should they choose to exercise such renewals 
the renewal periods  if exercised  would obligate us to sell the customer approximately million lng gallons on an annual basis subject to a price cap of per mmbtu on the socal border index for each renewal year 
we will continue to offer fixed price contracts as appropriate and consistent with our revised natural gas hedging policy adopted in may our lng contracts provide that we charge our customers periodically based on the volume of lng supplied 
government incentives from october  through december   we may receive a volumetric excise tax credit vetc of per gasoline gallon equivalent of cng and per liquid gallon of lng that we sell as vehicle fuel 
based on the service relationship we have with our customers  either we or our customers are able to claim the credit 
we record these tax credits as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations as the credits are fully refundable and do not need to offset tax liabilities to be received 
as such  the credits are not deemed income tax credits under sfas no 
in addition  we believe the credits are properly recorded as revenue because we often incorporate the tax credits into our pricing with our customers  thereby lowering the actual price per gallon we charge them 
we expect the tax credit will continue to factor into the price we charge our customers for cng and lng in the future 
the legislation that created this tax credit also increased the federal excise taxes on sales of cng from to per gasoline gallon equivalent and on sales of lng from to per lng gallon 
these new excise tax rates are approximately the same as those for gasoline and diesel fuel 
operation and maintenance we generate a portion of our revenue from operation and maintenance agreements for cng fueling stations where we do not supply the fuel 
we refer to this portion of our business as o m 
at these fueling stations  the customer contracts directly with a local broker or utility to purchase natural gas 
for o m services  we do not sell the fuel itself  but generally charge a per gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station 
we include the volume of fuel dispensed at stations at which we provide o m services in our calculation of aggregate gallon equivalents sold 
station construction we generate a small portion of our revenue from designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing the stations to our customers 
for these projects  we act as general contractor or supervise qualified third party contractors 
we charge construction fees or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project 
vehicle acquisition and finance in  we commenced offering vehicle finance services for some of our customers purchases of natural gas vehicles or the conversion of their existing gasoline or diesel powered vehicles to operate on natural gas 
we loan to certain qualifying customers on average and on occasion up to of the purchase price of their natural gas vehicles 
we may also lease vehicles in the future 
where appropriate  we apply for and receive state and federal incentives associated with natural gas vehicle purchases and pass these benefits through to our customers 
we may also secure vehicles to place with customers or pay deposits with respect to such vehicles prior to receiving a firm order from our customers  which we may be required to purchase if our customer fails to purchase the vehicle as anticipated 
as of december   we have not generated significant revenue from vehicle finance activities 
landfill gas in august  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of dce for a purchase price of million including transaction costs 
dce owns a facility that collects  processes and sells biomethane from the mccommas bluff landfill located in dallas  texas 
from the acquisition date through december   dce generated approximately million in revenue from sales of biomethane  all of which is included in our consolidated revenue total 
volatility of earnings and cash flows our earnings and cash flows historically have fluctuated significantly from period to period based on our futures activities  as all but a few of our futures contracts have not historically qualified for hedge accounting under sfas see critical accounting policies derivative activities below 
we have therefore recorded any changes in the fair market value of these contracts directly in our statements of operations in the line item derivative gains losses along with any realized gains or losses generated during the period 
for example  we experienced derivative gains of million and million for the three months ended september  and june   and derivative losses of million  million  million  million  million and million for the three months ended december   march   september   december   september  and december   respectively 
we had no derivative gains or losses for the three months ended june   march   june   september   december  and march  commencing with the adoption of our natural gas hedging policy in may  we plan to structure all subsequent futures contracts as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 but we can not be certain that they will qualify 
see risk management activities below 
if the futures contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  we could incur significant increases or decreases in our earnings based on fluctuations in the market value of the contracts from period to period 
additionally  we are required to maintain a margin account to cover losses related to our natural gas futures contacts 
futures contracts are valued daily  and if our contracts are in loss positions at the end of a trading day  our broker will transfer the amount of the losses from our margin account to a clearinghouse 
if at any time the funds in our margin account drop below a specified maintenance level  our broker will issue a margin call that requires us to restore the balance 
consequently  these payments could significantly impact our cash balances 
at december   we had million on deposit in margin accounts 
the decrease in the value of our futures positions and any required margin deposits on our futures contracts that are in a loss position could significantly impact our financial condition in the future 
debt compliance our credit agreement with plainscapital bank credit agreement requires us to comply with certain covenants 
we may not incur indebtedness or liens except as permitted by the credit agreement  or declare or pay dividends 
we must maintain minimum liquidity of not less than million at each quarter end beginning december   maintain an accounts receivable balance  as defined  at each month end of not less than million beginning august   maintain consolidated net worth  as defined  of not less than million and a debt to equity ratio  as defined  of not more than to at each quarter end beginning september   and a debt service ratio  as defined  of not less than to for each quarterly period beginning june  effective in the fourth quarter of  we established a lock box arrangement with pcb subject to the credit agreement 
funds received from our customers are remitted to the lock box and then deposited to a pcb bank account 
the remitted funds are not used to pay down the balance of the credit agreement 
however  if we default on the credit agreement  all of the obligations under the credit agreement will become due and payable and all funds received in our lock box held by pcb will be applied to the balance due on the credit agreement 
one of the events of default is the occurrence of a material adverse change  which is a subjective acceleration clause 
based on the guidance in emerging issues tax force issue no 
balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement eitf no 
 we have classified our debt pursuant to the credit agreement as short term or long term  as appropriate  and we believe an event of default is more than remote but not more likely than not 
if we default on the credit agreement  all of the obligations under the credit agreement will become immediately due and payable and all funds received in our lockbox held by pcb and million we have deposited with pcb in a payment reserve account will be applied to the balance due on the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with the covenants as of december  one of our bank covenants is a requirement to maintain accounts receivable balances from certain subsidiaries above million at each month end during the term 
to the extent natural gas prices continue to fall  which a significant portion of our revenues are derived from  or our volumes decline  we could violate this covenant in the future 
in this event  we would seek a waiver from the bank 
we were in compliance with this covenant as of january  risk management activities historically  a significant portion of our natural gas fuel sales are covered by contracts to sell lng or cng to our customers at a fixed price or a variable index based price subject to a cap 
these contracts expose us to the risk that the price of natural gas may increase above the natural gas cost component included in the price at which we are committed to sell gas to our customers 
we account for sales of natural gas under these contracts as described below in critical accounting policies fixed price and price cap sales contracts 
risk management practices before february historically  when we entered into a contract to sell natural gas fuel to a customer at a fixed price or a variable price subject to a cap  we generally sought to manage our exposure to natural gas price increases for some or all of the expected contract volumes in the natural gas futures market 
we did this by purchasing futures contracts that were designed to cover the difference between the commodity portion of the price at which we were committed to sell natural gas and the price we had to pay for gas at delivery  thereby fixing the cost of natural gas we were paying 
we generally purchased futures covering all or a portion of our anticipated volumes in future periods 
from time to time  if we believed natural gas prices would decline in the future  we often elected to terminate futures contracts associated with fixed price or price cap customer contracts by selling the futures contracts and recognizing a gain upon such sales 
when we did so  we lost future economic protections provided by the futures contracts 
from through  we sold futures contracts covering estimated sales volumes over future periods and realized a net gain of approximately million upon the sale of these contracts 
in  we disposed of certain futures contracts covering estimated sales volumes over future periods and realized a net loss of million 
these futures contracts were transferred to and assumed by boone pickens in december see note to our consolidated financial statements and the discussion below 
our derivative activities that do not qualify for hedge accounting are reflected in the line item derivative gains losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
two components make up this line item realized gains losses  and unrealized gains losses 
realized gains losses represent the actual gains losses we realize when we sell or settle a futures contract during a period 
unrealized gains losses represent the gain or loss we record at the end of each period when we mark to market our open futures contracts at the end of each period 
for realized gains losses on contracts sold or settled during a period  there is typically a corresponding unrealized loss gain on the contracts since the contracts are no longer outstanding at the end of the period and are therefore marked to zero 
we have a derivative committee of our board of directors and have historically conducted our futures contract activity under the advice of bp capital lp bp capital  an entity of which boone pickens  our largest stockholder and a director  is the principal 
through march   we paid bp capital a monthly fee of  and a commission equal to of our realized gains  net of realized losses  during a calendar year relating to the purchase and sale of natural gas futures contracts 
bp capital remits realized net gains to us  less its applicable commissions  on a monthly basis 
we paid fees to bp capital of million in  and  in and in in march  we amended our agreement with bp capital to remove the commission on our realized gains and losses during a calendar year 
we historically have purchased our natural gas futures contracts from sempra energy trading corp 
the futures are based on the henry hub natural gas price set on the new york mercantile exchange 
one futures contract for cng covers approximately  gasoline gallon equivalents of cng  and one futures contract for lng covers approximately  gallons of lng 
august purchase of futures contracts and december assumption by boone pickens on august   we purchased the following futures contracts and made related deposits of million futures settlement year volume covered by futures gasoline gallon equivalents in december  mr 
pickens assumed all of these futures contracts  together with any and all associated liabilities and obligations  in exchange for the issuance to mr 
pickens of a five year warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share which warrant was valued at million  and the assignment to mr 
pickens of any refunds of margin deposits related to the assumed futures contracts that were made using money borrowed under the line of credit 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at the time of assumption  these futures contracts had lost million in value 
the difference between the value of the warrant and the value of the losses on the futures contracts million was recorded in our statement of operations as a loss on extinguishment of derivative liability 
this warrant will be dilutive to net income per share if the fair market value of our common stock exceeds per share in the future 
adoption of revised natural gas hedging policy in february in an effort to mitigate the volatility of our earnings related to our futures contracts and to reduce our risk related to fixed price sales contracts  our board of directors revisited our risk management policies and procedures and adopted a revised natural gas hedging policy in february  which was amended effective may  and restricts our ability to purchase natural gas futures contracts and offer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
unless otherwise agreed in advance by the board of directors and the derivative committee  we will conduct our futures activities and offer fixed price sales contracts only in accordance with the natural gas hedging policy  a complete copy of which was filed as exhibit to our form k filed with the sec on june  and is incorporated by reference herein 
pursuant to the policy  we only purchase futures contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular fixed price contract or bid 
subject to the conditions set forth in the policy  we purchase futures contracts in quantities reasonably expected to hedge effectively our exposure to cash flow variability related to such fixed price sales contracts entered into after the date of the policy 
summary of the policy described above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the policy previously filed 
due to the restrictions of our revised hedging policy  we expect to offer significantly fewer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
if we do offer a fixed price sales contract  we anticipate including a price component that would cover our increased costs as well as a return on our estimated cash requirements over the duration of the underlying futures contract 
the amount of this price component will vary based on the anticipated volume to be covered under the fixed price sales contract 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  notes receivable reserves  derivative values  income taxes  and the market value of equity instruments granted as stock based compensation 
we use historical experience  market quotes  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
note receivable reserve at december   we have reserved million against a million loan to a natural gas vehicle conversion company 
when assessing the collectability of the note  we assess the company s projected future cash flows  their backlog of business  and the value of our collateral  among other factors 
we recorded million of the reserve in  and million of the reserve in if the company s future cash projections do not materialize as planned  or they require and we agree to loan them additional money  we could incur additional losses on this loan in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on our gas sales and for our o m services in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
applying these factors  we typically recognize revenue from the sale of natural gas at the time fuel is dispensed or  in the case of lng sales agreements  delivered to the customer s storage facility 
we recognize revenue from operation and maintenance agreements as we provide the o m services 
in certain transactions with our customers  we agree to provide multiple products or services  including construction of and either leasing or sale of a station  providing operations and maintenance to the station  and sale of fuel to the customer 
we evaluate the separability of revenues for deliverables based on the guidance set forth in eitf no 
 which provides a framework for establishing whether or not a particular arrangement with a customer has one or more deliverables 
to the extent we have adequate objective evidence of the values of separate deliverable items under a contract  we allocate the revenue from the contract on a relative fair value basis at the inception of the arrangement 
during  and  we did not have objective evidence for our multi deliverable contracts 
if the arrangement contains a lease  we use the existing evidence of fair value to separate the lease from the other deliverables 
we account for our leasing activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
our existing station leases are sales type leases  giving rise to profit at the delivery of the leased station 
unearned revenue is amortized into income over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 
for those arrangements  we recognize gas sales and operations and maintenance service revenues as earned from the customer on a volume delivered basis 
we recognize revenue on fueling station construction projects where we sell the station to the customer using the completed contract method in aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
derivative activities we account for our derivative instruments  specifically our futures contracts  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
our derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
for the years ended december  and  and we did not have any derivative activities in as such  changes in the fair value of the derivatives were recorded directly to our consolidated statements of operations in and we determine the fair value of our derivatives at the end of each reporting period based on quoted market prices from the nymex discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts related to future periods 
during  we had two contracts that did qualify for hedge accounting and certain other contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
we record gains or losses realized on our derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
during the period in the line item derivative gains losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we also mark to market our open positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
at the end of each reporting period with the resulting gain or loss recorded to derivative gains losses in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   all of our futures contracts qualified for hedge accounting 
fixed price and price cap sales contracts without an underlying futures contract our contracts to sell cng and lng at a fixed price or a variable price subject to a cap are  for accounting purposes  firm commitments 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  we record the actual results of delivering the fuel under the contract as the sale of the natural gas occurs 
when we enter into these fixed price or price cap contracts with our customers  the price is set based on the prevailing index price of natural gas at that time 
however  the index price of natural gas constantly changes  and a difference between the fixed price of the natural gas included in the customer s contract price and the corresponding index price of natural gas typically develops after we enter into the sales contract 
if we do not have a derivative contract to hedge the natural gas  and if at the time we sell natural gas under the contract the prevailing index price for natural gas exceeds the commodity portion of our contracted sale price  we incur a loss 
prior to december   we entered into several contracts to sell lng or cng to customers at a fixed price or an index based price that is subject to a fixed price cap and subsequently sold the underlying futures contract prior to the expiration of the customer s sales contract 
during these contracts  the price of natural gas generally increased from the price of natural gas when we set the cng and lng price 
the following table summarizes important information regarding our fixed price and price cap supply contracts where we do not have an underlying futures contract and we are required to sell fuel to our customers as of december  estimated volumes a average price b contracts duration cng fixed price contracts  through lng fixed price contracts  through cng price cap contracts  through lng price cap contracts  through this table does not include two million lng gallon per year renewal options beginning april  that one of our customers possesses related to an lng price cap contract 
the contract contains a price cap of per mmbtu on the socal border index 
a estimated volumes are in gasoline gallon equivalents for cng contracts and are in lng gallons for lng contracts and represent the volumes we anticipate delivering over the remaining duration of the contracts 
b average prices are in gasoline gallon equivalents for cng contracts and are in lng gallons for lng contracts 
the average prices represent the natural gas commodity component in the customer s contract 
the price of natural gas has generally increased since we entered into these contracts and fixed or capped the price of cng or lng that we sell to the customers 
if these contracts had a notional amount as defined under gaap  then the contracts would be considered derivatives and we would record a loss based on estimated future volumes and the estimated excess of current market prices for natural gas above the cost of the natural gas commodity component of our customer s fixed price or price cap 
however  because the contracts have no minimum purchase requirements  they are not considered derivatives and any estimated future losses under these contracts cannot be accrued in our financial statements under gaap and we recognize the actual results of performing under the contract as the fuel is delivered 
if we applied a derivative valuation methodology to these contracts using estimated volumes along with other assumptions  including forward pricing curves and discount rates  we estimate our pre tax net income would have been higher by the following ranges for the periods indicated year ended december   to  december   to  december   to  these amounts are based on estimates involving a high degree of judgment and actual results may vary materially from these estimates 
these amounts have not been recorded in our statements of operations as they are non gaap 
at december   we estimate we will incur between  and  to cover the increased price of natural gas above the inherent price of natural gas embedded in our customer s fixed price and price cap contracts over the duration of the contracts 
these estimates were based on natural gas futures prices on december   and these estimates may change based on future natural gas prices and may be significantly higher or lower 
our volumes under these contracts  in gasoline gallon equivalents  expire as follows income taxes we compute income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  are applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment 
we record a valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets when management determines it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
when evaluating the need for a valuation analysis  we use estimates involving a high degree of judgment including projected future income and the amounts and estimated timing of the reversal of any deferred tax liabilities 
stock based compensation effective january   we account for stock options granted using statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  which has replaced sfas no 
and apb under sfas no 
r  companies are no longer able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb  but are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the statements of operations 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value our options  which requires that we make assumptions concerning the market price of our stock  our stock price volatility  our projected dividends  and the risk free inherent rate applicable to the relevant period 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
under the prospective transition method  only new awards  or awards that have been modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  are accounted for using the fair value method 
as of december   there were no unvested stock options 
therefore  the impact of sfas no 
r has been reflected in the consolidated statements of operations for share based awards granted in  and impairment of goodwill and long lived assets we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is an indicator of impairment based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
an initial assessment of impairment is made by comparing the fair value of the operations with goodwill  which in our case is the us operations  as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 to the book value 
when assessing fair value  we look at our projected future cash flows and our market capitalization for the respective operations 
to the extent our projected future cash flows do not materialized as planned or our market capitalization goes down  which could occur during the current economic contraction  we may be forced to take an impairment charge in future periods 
our goodwill balance at december  was million 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an impairment is indicated and we must perform a second test to measure the amount of the impairment 
in the second test  we calculate the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the operations with goodwill from the fair value determined in step one of the assessment 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds this calculated implied fair value of the goodwill  we will record an impairment charge 
we performed our annual tests of goodwill as of december   and  and there was no impairment indicated 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note d to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in our average price per gallon between periods

interest income  net  decreased by million from million in the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in interest income in due to lower average cash balances on hand during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   which included higher cash balances associated with the proceeds received from our initial public offering in may other expense  net 
other expense  net  was essentially the same between years 
equity in losses of equity method investee

minority interest in net income 
during the year ended december   we recorded million for the minority interest in the net income of dce 
the minority interest represents the interest of our joint venture partner 
the results of dce s operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since august   the date of acquisition 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased by million to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  a portion of this increase was the result of an increase in the number of cng and lng gallons delivered from million gasoline gallon equivalents to million gasoline gallon equivalents  together with an increase in our average price per gallon between periods 
our effective price per gallon was in the year ended december   which represents a per gallon increase from in the year ended december  one of our new transit customers long island bus  ny and one of our new airport customers los angeles international airport shuttle busses together accounted for million gasoline gallons equivalents of the increase 
the remaining increase in gasoline gallon equivalents delivered was due to the addition of other smaller new customers and growth from our existing customers

other expense  net  was  in the year ended december   as compared to  in the year ended december  in  costs related to station closures were higher due to the closing of six cng stations in canada 
seasonality and inflation to some extent  we experience seasonality in our results of operations 
natural gas vehicle fuel consumed by some of our customers tends to be higher in summer months when buses and other fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems 
natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods 
since our inception  inflation has not significantly affected our operating results 
however  costs for construction  repairs  maintenance and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures and could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately  build new stations  build new lng plants and expand our existing facilities 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities  cash and cash equivalents  the issuance of common stock  sometimes in association with the exercise of certain warrants that were callable at our option  and in a revolving line of credit with boone pickens  our majority stockholder 
in may  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the initial public offering were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
on august   in connection with our acquisition of of the membership interests of dce  we entered into a credit agreement with plainscapital bank pursuant to which we borrowed million under a term loan and an additional million as of december  under a line of credit see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on september   we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share to boone pickens interests  ltd 
for proceeds of approximately million 
on november  we sold  units of common stock and warrants for per unit see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the transaction and we raised net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering costs 
in addition to funding operations  our principal uses of cash have been  and are expected to be  the construction of new fueling stations  the construction of our new lng liquefaction plant in california  the purchase of new lng tanker trailers  the financing of natural gas vehicles for our customers  and general corporate purposes  including making deposits to support our derivative activities  geographic expansion domestically and internationally  expanding our sales and marketing activities  our support for proposition and for working capital for our expansion 
we may also seek to acquire companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries 
we financed our operations in primarily through cash on hand 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  we did not have any short term investments at december  as we sold them all in we had million of short term investments at december  cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  this decrease in operating cash flow was primarily related to an increase in our net loss between periods  which included million of expenditures to support proposition in we also made million of deposits on our futures contracts in offsetting these decreases was a million increase between periods related to returns of lng truck deposits 
the remaining changes primarily resulted from changes in working capital balances  which were mostly due to timing differences related to the various cash flows between periods 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  our purchases of property and equipment were million during included in purchases of property and equipment in was million of construction costs related to our lng liquefaction plant in california 
in  we purchased million of short term investments with our initial public offering proceeds from may in  all of our short term investments were sold or matured resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
in august  we purchased a interest in dce and our total cash outlay for the acquisition including transaction costs was approximately million  net of cash acquired 
we also made an investment during of million in the vehicle production group  llc  a company developing a cng taxi and a paratransit vehicle  and transferred million of our cash balance to a restricted account in accordance with our august credit agreement with plainscapital bank 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  in may  we completed our initial public offering  which raised million during in august  we borrowed million to fund the acquisition of our interest in dce  and to pay other amounts related to the transaction 
in september  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million to boone pickens 
in addition  in november  we issued and sold to third party investors  units of common stock and warrants consisting of an aggregate of  shares of common stock  series i warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock  and series ii warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of common stock and we raised net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering costs 
in december  we executed capital leases for equipment at two fueling station locations and raised million 
we had paid for the equipment throughout before executing the capital leases 
our financial position and liquidity are  and will be  influenced by a variety of factors  including our ability to generate cash flows from operations  deposits and margin calls on our futures positions  the level of any outstanding indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness  and our capital expenditure requirements  which consist primarily of station construction  lng plant construction and maintenance costs  and the purchase of lng tanker trailers and equipment 
capital expenditures our current business plan calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations 
in addition  we anticipate that during we will provide approximately million for financing natural gas vehicle purchases by our customers and up to million in financing that we may be required to provide to the vehicle production group llc  a company that is developing cng paratransit vehicles and taxis 
through march   we have provided our joint venture subsidiary dce with approximately million in financing under our loan agreement with dce and we anticipate that we will provide up to approximately million in additional loan financing to dce during the remainder of for additional capital expenditures and expenses 
financing provided to dce is not included in our capital expenditure business plan and we anticipate that we will fund all additional financing we provide to dce through our million facility b loan with plainscapital bank  which has approximately million in remaining available credit as of march  we intend to fund our principal liquidity requirements  other than our loan to dce  through cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operations  however  we may pursue station construction opportunities that are not currently under contract or in our capital expenditure plan or seek to acquire or invest in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries 
we may also decide to invest in expanding our california lng plant or other lng production assets 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund any such acquisitions  strategic transactions  increases in station construction activity  expansion of our california lng plant or other unanticipated capital expenditures 
if we do need to raise additional capital  the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend primarily on our rate of new station construction and the decision on when we need to expand our california lng plant 
due to the continuing disruption in the capital markets  we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and reduce our ability to invest in our business and generate increased revenues 
our credit agreement with plainscapital bank requires that we comply with certain covenants  as detailed in footnote of our financial statements 
one of the covenants requires that we maintain accounts receivable balances from certain subsidiaries above million at each month end during the term 
to the extent natural gas prices continue to fall  which would result in decreased revenues  or our volumes sold decline  we could violate this covenant in the future 
in this event  we would seek a waiver from the bank  which the bank is not obligated to grant 
if the bank does not grant the waiver  all of the obligations under the credit agreement will become immediately due and payable and million of our funds held by plainscapital bank would be applied to the balance due on the plainscapital bank loans 
we also would be unable to use the plainscapital line of credit to fund our loan to dce if this were to occur 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of january  contractual obligations the following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt and capital lease obligations a operating lease commitments b take or pay lng purchase contracts c construction contracts d other long term contract liabilities e total a consists of long term debt and capital lease obligations to finance equipment purchases  including interest 
b consists of various space and ground leases for our california lng plant  offices and fueling stations as well as leases for equipment 
c the amounts in the table represent our estimates for our fixed lng purchase commitments under two take or pay contracts 
in october  we entered into a year contingent take or pay commitment for  lng gallons per day from an lng plant to be constructed in arizona  which commitment is not reflected in the table above because the obligation is contingent on the completion of construction of the lng plant  which is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of d consists of our obligations to fund various fueling station construction projects  net of amounts funded through december   and excluding contractual commitments related to station sales contracts 
e consists of our obligations to fund certain vehicles under binding purchase agreements and our commitments under binding purchase agreements and contracts we have entered into to acquire certain equipment and services related to the construction of our lng plant in california 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements that had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material affect on our financial condition 
outstanding surety bonds for construction contracts and general corporate purposes totaling million  two take or pay contracts for the purchase of lng  operating leases where we are the lessee  capital leases where we are the lessor and owner of the equipment  and firm commitments to sell cng and lng at fixed prices or index plus prices subject to a price cap 
we provide surety bonds primarily for construction contracts in the ordinary course of business  as a form of guarantee 
no liability has been recorded in connection with our surety bonds as we do not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements for which we will not be reimbursed 
we have entered into contracts with two vendors to purchase lng that require us to purchase minimum volumes from the vendors 
one of the contracts expires in march and the other contract expires in june the minimum commitments under these two contracts are included in the table set forth under take or pay lng purchase contracts above 
in october  we entered into a contingent take or pay contract from an lng plant that is not included in the table above as it is contingent on the lng plant being constructed 
we anticipate construction of the plant will be completed in the second quarter of we have entered into operating lease arrangements for certain equipment and for our office and field operating locations in the ordinary course of business 
the terms of our leases expire at various dates through additionally  in november  we entered into a ground lease for acres in california on which we are building an lng liquefaction plant 
the lease is for an initial term of years  beginning on the date that the plant commences operations  and requires annual base rent payments of  per year  plus up to  per year for each million gallons of production capacity utilized  subject to future adjustment based on consumer price index changes 
we must also pay a royalty to the landlord for each gallon of lng produced at the facility  as well as for certain other services that the landlord will provide 
commercial operations began december   and the payments for this lease are included in operating lease commitments in the contractual obligations table set forth above 
we are also the lessor in various leases with our customers  whereby our customers lease from us certain stations and equipment that we own 
the leases generally qualify as sales type leases for accounting purposes  which result in our customers  the lessees  reflecting the property and equipment on their balance sheets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
we are subject to market risk with respect to our sales of natural gas  which has historically been subject to volatile market conditions 
our exposure to market risk is heightened when we have a fixed price or price cap sales contract with a customer that is not covered by a futures contract  or when we are otherwise unable to pass through natural gas price increases to customers 
natural gas prices and availability are affected by many factors  including weather conditions  overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations 
natural gas costs represented of our cost of sales for and of our cost of sales for prices for natural gas over the eight year period from december  through december   based on the nymex daily futures data  has ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
at december   the nymex index price of natural gas was per mcf 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in natural gas  we may enter into exchange traded natural gas futures contracts 
these arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the other party to the contract defaults on its contract or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the contract and the actual price of natural gas we pay at the delivery point 
we account for these futures contracts in accordance with sfas under this standard  the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends upon whether it has been designated in a hedging relationship and  further  on the type of hedging relationship 
to qualify for designation in a hedging relationship  specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained 
our futures contracts did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas for the years ended december  and  and we did not have any derivative activity in consequently  any changes in the fair value of the derivatives during and were recorded directly to our consolidated statements of operations 
in  we had certain contracts that did not qualify for hedge accounting and we had two derivative contracts to hedge two supply contracts that did qualify for hedge accounting 
the fair value of the futures contracts we use is based on quoted prices in active exchange traded or over the counter markets which are then discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts applicable to future periods 
the fair value of these futures contracts is continually subject to change due to changing market conditions 
the net effect of the realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these derivative instruments for the year ended december  was a million decrease to pre tax income 
we did not have any futures contracts outstanding during the year ended december  in an effort to mitigate the volatility in our earnings related to futures activities  in february  our board of directors adopted a revised natural gas hedging policy which restricts our ability to purchase natural gas futures contracts and offer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
this policy was further revised by our board of directors in may we plan to structure prospective futures contracts so that they will be accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas  but we cannot be certain they will qualify 
for more information  please read risk management activities above 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to futures contracts we hold as of december  to hedge the fixed price component of two lng supply contracts 
if the price of natural gas were to fluctuate increase or decrease by from the price quoted on nymex on december  per mcf  we could expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the contracts of approximately million 
we have also prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to our fixed price and price cap sales contracts as of december  where we do not have an underlying futures contract 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the fair market value of natural gas prices 
the results of this analysis  which assumes natural gas prices are in excess of our customer s price cap arrangements  and may differ from actual results  are as follows hypothetical adverse change in price change in annual pre tax income in millions fixed price contracts price cap contracts this table does not include two million lng gallon per year renewal options beginning april   that one of our customers possesses related to an lng price cap contract 
had the contract been included  assuming both renewal options were exercised  the resulting amount for the price cap contracts would be million
