item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding these statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
see item a risk factors for factors that could cause future results to differ materially 
overview we design  develop and market telecommunications equipment for use in enhancing voice quality and canceling echo in voice calls over wireline  wireless and internet protocol ip telecommunications networks 
our products monitor and enhance voice quality and provide transcoding in the delivery of voice services 
since entering the voice processing market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
our tdm based product introductions have leveraged the processing capacity of our newer hardware platforms to offer not only echo cancellation but also enhanced voice quality assurance vqa features including noise reduction  acoustic echo cancellation  voice level control and noise compensation through enhanced voice intelligibility 
we have also introduced products to support carriers that are deploying voice over internet protocol  or voip  technologies which offer all the voice capabilities of our tdm based products along with codec transcoding to meet the new challenges faced by carriers deploying voip technologies 
most recently we announced our development efforts on our new toktok and mstage products  which further leverage off our expertise in voice technology enabling on demand  voice driven  mid call accessible applications and services to be delivered to customers on wireless and wireline voice networks 
this offering is being designed to enable phone subscribers to use their voice as well as their thumbs to interact with web applications services like social networking and instant messaging im on demand  even on the fly during a telephone call 
since becoming a public company in june  our financial success has been primarily predicated on the macroeconomic environment of us wireline and  more recently  wireless carriers as well as our success in selling to the larger carriers 
over the years since becoming public  we have experienced ebbs and flows in the level of demand from these carriers due to their level of network expansion  adoption of new technologies in their networks and the impacts of merger and other consolidation in the industry 
of late  the downturn in business volume we have experienced seems to have been driven by three main factors technology transitions  budgetary constraints  and the global economic crisis 
the technology transition has impacted us on two fronts 
first and foremost  carriers have been extremely cautious to invest in legacy second generation g technology  historically our primary source of revenue  for fear of stranding some or all of their investments by moving to the newer voip based third generation technology g 
the hesitancy to invest in g equipment has resulted in protracted purchase cycles and smaller deployments to mitigate their perceived risks  while still addressing needed improvements in voice quality in their g networks 
the second impact has been felt on the g investment  which has been far slower to develop than was first predicted by industry experts 
instead of wholesale deployment of voip technologies we have experienced a much more cautious entrance into this technology by many of the carriers with which we have historically done business  with the key by product being that they are buying much smaller systems than would have been expected from their historical buying pattern and in some cases even deciding to limit their 
table of contents investment in g technology in lieu of even newer fourth generation technologies that are currently in development 
on the budgetary side  even before the world wide financial crisis became clear  we began to see tighter budgetary spending on capital equipment in many regions of the world  but most importantly with our large domestic customers 
as such  spending on capital equipment appears to have been primarily targeted at equipment that could show a direct correlation with revenue generation as opposed to our historical product offerings  which although not a direct source of revenue for carriers is critical to the overall call experience and therefore to customer satisfaction  which in our opinion ultimately translates into call revenue 
it is with this capital spending model in mind that we undertook development of our toktok and mstage products which  although leveraging off of our core knowledge of voice technology  we believe will be our first product offering to truly be tied to an identifiable revenue stream for our carriers 
last  we believe that the current market conditions around the world have and could continue to create further delays in purchasing decisions both as carriers tighten their capital investment activity due to internal budget constraints and as tighter credit hampers their ability to borrow to facilitate network expansion and or upgrades 
despite the previously mentioned delays due to budget and uncertainty around network architecture  we continue to believe that in the united states our continued focus on voice quality in the competitive wireless services landscape and the continued expansion of wireless networks  using either g or g technologies  will be key factors in adding new customers and driving opportunities for revenue growth 
the development of our vqa feature set  which was originally targeted at the international global system for mobile communications gsm market  has seen growing importance in the domestic market as well 
we continue to focus sales and marketing efforts on international and domestic mobile carriers who might best apply our vqa solution 
we have continued to invest in customer trials domestically and internationally in an attempt to better avail ourselves of these opportunities as they arise 
despite these efforts  we have experienced mixed results as we remain dependant on the buying patterns of a small  yet more diverse  group of carriers 
we expect long term opportunities for growth will occur in voip based network deployments as there appears to be a growing  albeit slow  trend of service providers transitioning from traditional circuit switched network infrastructure to voip 
as such  between fiscal and early fiscal we have directed the majority of our research and development spending towards the development of our packet voice processor pvp  a platform targeting voip based network deployments 
the packet voice processor introduces cost effective voice format transcoding capabilities combined with our vqa technology to improve call quality and clarity by eliminating acoustic echo and voice level imbalances and reducing packet loss  delay and jitter 
although fiscal marked the first period in which revenue from the packet voice processor exceeded of total revenue  ordering patterns are still volatile leading to spikes in the timing and amount of revenue from this product 
beginning in fiscal  we began shifting our development efforts to other product offerings that leverage our expertise in voice technology 
the first effort was tied to the creation of licensed versions of our core technology for use in other elements within communications networks  such as bluetooth headsets 
more recently we have shifted the majority of our development efforts to our recently announced mstage and toktok products  which are currently in development 
while the bluetooth opportunities are focused on moving our expertise in voice quality to the communication interface devices at the fringe of the voice networks  mstage and toktok will enable mobile subscribers to use their voice as well as their thumbs to interact with web applications like social networking and im on demand  even during a phone call 
we are undertaking these new opportunities in an effort to not only diversify our product offerings but also our customer base 
we believe that these products could help generate a more predictable revenue base  which we believe is less susceptible to our customer s 
table of contents decisions on the timing and nature of the network expansions than our legacy product offerings have experienced on a stand alone basis 
acquisition history 
although we regularly evaluate whether there are acquisition candidates that have technologies that would compliment our products and core strengths  in the last five fiscal years  we have completed only one acquisition 
in june  we acquired jasomi  which developed and sold session border controllers that enable voip calls to traverse the network address translation  or nat  and protect networks from external attacks by admitting only authorized sessions  ensuring that reliable voip service can be provided to them 
consideration for the acquisition totaled approximately million 
we additionally issued shares of ditech restricted stock to new employees hired as part of the acquisition 
our customer base 
historically  the majority of our sales have been to customers in the united states 
although these customers have traditionally accounted for well over of our revenue in a given period  they are becoming a smaller percentage due to the growing interest in our vqa technology in several key international markets 
domestic customers accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal and and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
however  sales to some of our us customers may result in our products purchased by these customers eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  the vast majority of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
growth in international revenue  as a percentage of total review  has been largely driven by demand from customers in south east asia  the middle east and latin america 
we expect our international demand to continue to be heavily influenced these markets as they are experiencing the highest level of growth and commonly have the most need for cost effective solutions to address voice quality in their growing networks 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our largest customer accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal and and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal and and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
consequently  the loss of any one of our largest customers  without an offsetting increase in revenue from existing or new customers  would have a negative and substantial effect on our business 
this customer concentration risk was evidenced in fiscal and again over the last two fiscal years as sudden delays and or declines in purchases by our large customers resulted in significant declines in our overall revenues and ultimately resulted in net losses for those periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our revenues  allowance for bad debts  provisions for inventories  warranties and recovery of deferred income taxes receivable 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
if and when adjustments are required to reflect material differences arising between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in applying our revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies the level of judgment is generally relatively limited  as the vast majority of our revenue has been generated by a handful of relatively long standing customer relationships 
these customers are some of the largest wire line and wireless carriers in the world and our relationships with them are 
table of contents documented in contracts  which clearly highlight potential revenue recognition issues  such as passage of title and risk of loss 
as of april   we had deferred million of revenue 
however  only to the extent that we have received cash for a given deferred revenue transaction is the deferred revenue recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
of the million of total deferred revenue transactions at april   only million had been collected from customers and therefore reported as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
the balance of million related to uncollected deferred revenue transactions was reported net against the related accounts receivable balance 
of the million of revenue deferred as of april   approximately million was associated with installations and other product related deferrals and million was associated with maintenance contracts 
in dealing with the remaining smaller customers  we closely evaluate the credit risk of these customers 
in those cases where credit risk is deemed to be high  we either mitigate the risk by having the customer post a letter of credit  which we can draw against on a specified date  to effectively provide reasonable assurance of collection  or we defer the revenue until customer payment is received 
investments we consider investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but remaining maturities of less than one year  and auction rate securities  which we have historically settled on  or day auction cycles  as short term investments 
however  when auction rate securities fail to settle at auction  which occurred in fiscal and  and conditions leading to their failure to auction create uncertainty as to whether they will settle in the near term  we classify them as long term consistent with the contractual term of the underlying security 
long term investment securities include any investments with remaining maturities of one year or more and auction rate securities for which we are unable to estimate when they will settle 
short term and long term investments consist primarily of corporate notes and asset backed securities 
we have classified our investments as available for sale securities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we carry available for sale securities at fair value  and report unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities  if any  are included in other income  net based on specific identification 
we include interest on securities classified as available for sale in total other income 
see also the discussion in liquidity and capital resources and item a for additional information on auction rate securities 
inventory valuation allowances in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of inventory valuation  we constantly monitor projected demand on a product by product basis 
based on these projections we evaluate the levels of write downs required for inventory on hand and inventory on order from our contract manufacturers 
although we believe we have been reasonably successful in identifying write downs in a timely manner  sudden changes in buying patterns from our customers  either due to a shift in product interest and or a complete pull back from their expected order levels has resulted in the recognition of larger than anticipated write downs 
for example  we recorded inventory write downs for excess levels of inventory of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
there were no sales of previously written down inventory during fiscal or we did sell million of previously written down inventory in fiscal  which had a negligible impact on gross margin  as it was sold for approximately its net carrying value 
cost of warranty at the time that we recognize revenue  we accrue for the estimated costs of the warranty we offer on our products 
we currently offer warranties on the hardware elements of our products ranging from one to five years and warranties on the software elements of our products ranging from days to one year 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product and provide software bug fixes within the term of the warranty 
our accrual for the estimated warranty is based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those 
table of contents claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures 
this would result in a decrease in gross profits 
as of april   we had million accrued related to estimated future warranty costs 
see note of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances arise  we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carry amount of the assets in question  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our amortizable purchased intangible assets based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition 
the asset group represents the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during fiscal  we did record an impairment charge of approximately million associated with certain identifiable assets that were abandoned as a result of the cumulative affects of the reductions in force that had been implemented over the last two fiscal years 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period 
given our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options and  because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in our opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although we determine the fair value of employee stock options in accordance with sfas r and sab using the black scholes option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller in a market transaction 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected option life and volatility 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model or the estimated forfeiture rate changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
accounting for income taxes amounts recorded for income taxes  both current and deferred  are based on estimates of the tax consequences of our operations in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
our deferred taxes are the result of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
as part of our ongoing assessment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  on a quarterly basis we review the expiration dates of our net operating loss and research credit carry forwards 
in addition  we complete a study on the impact of section of the internal revenue code on at least a semi annual basis to determine whether a change in ownership may limit the value of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we determined that a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets beginning as of april  was required 
we have considered all evidence  positive and negative  pursuant to sfas  accounting for income taxes  and believe that based on our recent operating losses and uncertainty about the magnitude and timing of future operating profits  it is no longer more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
effective may   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

table of contents statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we have classified interest and penalties as a component of tax expense 
as a result of the implementation of fin effective may   we recognized a million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a decrease in the may  balance of accumulated deficit 
we do not expect a significant change to the liability for uncertain tax positions over the next months 
we have begun an audit by one of the state jurisdictions in which we do business for our fiscal filing 
other than this one state  we are currently not under audit for any other years or in any other jurisdictions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board released a fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
this fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the objective of this fsp is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r  and other principles of gaap 
this fsp applies to all intangible assets  whether acquired in a business combination or otherwise  and shall be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years and applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
early adoption is prohibited 
since this guidance will be applied prospectively  on adoption  there will be no impact on our current consolidated financial statements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable financial statement users to understand how and why a company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  because sfas only requires additional disclosure and we currently do not use derivative instrument  the adoption will not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
the provisions of sfas r are effective as of the beginning of  with the exception of adjustments made to acquired tax contingencies 
future adjustments made to acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the beginning of would apply the provisions of sfas r and will be evaluated based on the outcome of these matters 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
since this guidance will be 
table of contents applied prospectively and we currently do not have any non controlling interests  on adoption  there will be no impact our current consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods of those fiscal years 
in february  the fasb released a fasb staff position fsp fas effective date of fasb statement no 
which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  these non financial items include assets and liabilities such as reporting units measured at fair value in a goodwill impairment test and non financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
the adoption of sfas no 
as of may  for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued three related staff positions i fsp  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp  ii sfas and sfas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp and fsp  and iii sfas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  fsp and apb  which will be effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  fsp provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities under sfas in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
fsp and fsp modify the requirements for recognizing other than temporarily impaired debt securities and revise the existing impairment model for such securities  by modifying the current intent and ability indicator in determining whether a debt security is other than temporarily impaired 
fsp and apb enhance the disclosure of instruments under the scope of sfas for both interim and annual periods 
we are currently evaluating these staff positions 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated results of operations years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets impairment of goodwill and other purchased intangibles total operating expenses income loss from continuing operations total other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss discussion of fiscal years ended april    and revenue years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands revenue change the decrease in revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal  as well as fiscal compared to fiscal  was largely due to a decrease in revenue from our largest domestic customer  verizon  as well as declines in the overall purchases from the next four largest customers in fiscal and  without an increase in other domestic and international business to offset these declines 
in the aggregate  our top five customers in fiscal accounted for million of revenue in fiscal as opposed to the top five customers in fiscal and  which accounted for million and million  respectively 
our largest customer in fiscal  and  verizon accounted for approximately million  million and million of revenues  respectively 
this decline in revenue  both in real terms and as a percentage of revenue  appears to be largely due to verizon shifting focus away from their traditional wireless network deployments over the past to months  where our product has historically been installed  to newer g networks 
the mix of customers that represent our next four largest customers has changed year over year but is reflective of a growing trend of our international business becoming a larger percentage of our revenue base 
two customers  other than 
table of contents verizon  accounted for over of our revenue in fiscal and and only one customer  other than verizon  accounted for more than of revenue in fiscal although we have experienced a consistent number of customers representing greater than of our revenues during fiscal and  the overall dollar magnitude of the revenue from these customers continues to trend down as buying decisions continue to be slow to materialize and are generally for more conservative amounts than buying patterns experienced in fiscal and we believe that this protracted buying process and the smaller ordering levels are a function of tighter capital spending budgets and tighter credit markets  as well as uncertainty in the technical direction that companies are looking to take 
this indecision around future network design appears to have made carriers leery to invest heavily in legacy circuit switched technology due to the risk of stranding investments upon conversion to newer network technologies such as voip 
however  on the voip side we are experiencing carriers moving into the voip space in a more conservative manner than was expected by industry analysts  resulting in deployments at a fraction of the size that we are accustomed to seeing for circuit switched network deployments 
although our initial voip product was designed for large scale deployments and therefore was not easily adaptable to meet the smaller scale deployments that most carriers wanted to undertake  we have recently completed development of a smaller scale version of pvp product  which we began to ship in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we hope will more closely meet current market demands 
geographically  our domestic revenue for fiscal totaled of total worldwide revenue as compared to and realized in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the domestic portion of our revenue both in real terms and as a percentage of total revenue was primarily driven by the decline in verizon purchasing activity 
our international revenue has primarily been dependent on our success in selling vqa 
although we continue to believe that there are meaningful domestic and international revenue opportunities  we continue to experience slower than anticipated purchasing cycles from our existing and prospective customers  which has resulted in volatility in the level of revenue from quarter to quarter 
we plan to continue to invest in customer trials to attempt to capture the world wide revenue opportunities that exist for us 
we expect that sales of our tdm based bvp flex and qvp products will continue to represent the majority of our revenue in the foreseeable future  as carriers continue to be cautious in their deployment strategies of voip based communications networks 
revenue levels for fiscal will be dependent on our success in adding new customers domestically and internationally  the network technology and deployment plans of the north american telecommunication service providers  the market acceptance of our packet voice processor  and the timing and market acceptance of our toktok mstage products 
see item a risk factors for discussions of risks related to customer concentration and other factors  which could impact the timing and level of revenue 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding forward looking statements such as the statements made in the prior paragraphs about our expectations regarding our future revenue  as well as statements regarding our expectations in each of the categories below 
cost of goods sold and gross margin years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cost of goods sold change gross profit gross margin pts pts 
table of contents cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test  configuration and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  post sales installation costs  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal as compared to fiscal  well as fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily driven by the decrease in business volume 
our analysis of gross margin below discusses the other factors driving changes in cost of goods sold 
our gross margin percentage decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  largely due to the non product costs included in cost of goods sold  such as manufacturing and post sales installation costs  representing a larger percentage of our revenue 
certain of these costs are relatively fixed in nature and although we did experience a decline in these costs in real terms due to tighter cost control and the reductions in force over the last two years  as revenue levels declined in fiscal these costs become a larger percentage of revenue and therefore adversely impacted our gross margin by approximately eight percentage points 
partially offsetting the adverse movement in margin in fiscal was a decline in the provision of excess inventory  in both real terms and as a percentage of revenue  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  or a two percentage point improvement in gross margin 
in addition  the product and customer mix in fiscal improved slightly from that experienced in fiscal  which further offset the impacts of the non product costs 
gross margins in fiscal as compared to fiscal were adversely impacted by our fixed manufacturing costs representing a larger percentage of our lower revenue base 
in fiscal  these costs represented of revenue as compared to in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a write down of potentially excess inventory items totaling million of revenue 
these factors more than offset the positive impacts on gross margin realized from an improved customer and product mix in fiscal  including an increase in the percentage of revenue recognized from maintenance and extended warranty contracts due to the decline of product shipments in fiscal all other things being equal  we expect that if our revenue levels increase  gross margin percentages should improve from the current levels as the continued under absorption of manufacturing overheads will become a smaller percentage of a larger revenue base  resulting in improved margins 
however  we could experience further pricing pressures as we expand the distribution of our products internationally through value added resellers and distributors  which could cause our gross margins to decrease 
sales and marketing years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands sales and marketing expense of revenue pts pts sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
the decline in sales and marketing spending in fiscal  as compare to fiscal  was largely due to reductions in salaries and related expenses associated with the reductions in force that were affected in the latter half of fiscal and again in fiscal  which resulted in approximately million in reduced spending in fiscal in conjunction with the reduced headcount and tighter overall cost control over variable spending we experienced million in reduced spending for travel and related costs and costs associated with marketing programs and trade shows 
we also experienced a decline in sales and marketing variable compensation due to the reduction in sales levels in fiscal lastly  we 
table of contents experienced a decline in stock based compensation of million 
see the discussion regarding the changes in stock based compensation  below 
the decline in sales and marketing in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due in part to declines in salaries and related expense which decreased million 
this decline was largely due to a reduction in force at the end of the second quarter of fiscal and reduced variable compensation levels due to lower than planned sales levels 
we also saw a reduction in stock based compensation expense of million due to the older options becoming fully vested in fiscal and lower levels of stock compensation being incurred on newer option grants due to the decline in the price of our stock over much of the last two fiscal years 
the other factors that impacted the decline in sales and marketing expense included tighter spending control on travel and marketing programs which resulted in an aggregate reduction of million in fiscal and reduced agent fees of million due to reduced international sales in fiscal we expect that our sales and marketing expenses in fiscal will continue to decline from fiscal levels due to realizing a full year s worth of cost reductions from the reduction in force in mid fiscal and from continued cost controls 
these savings will likely be partially offset by increased variable compensation based on new sales targets for fiscal research and development years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands research and development expense of revenue pts pts research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  materials and supplies used in the development of voice processing products 
the decline in fiscal research and development spending was largely due to a million savings in payroll and related spending due to the reductions in force that have been implemented since the middle of fiscal as a result of the reduction in headcount over the last two fiscal years  we have also experienced a decline in allocated common costs due to lower space consumption and use of other support services of million and reduced travel and related costs of million 
lastly  we experienced a decline in stock compensation of million 
see the discussion regarding the changes in stock compensation  below 
the decline in spending in fiscal was largely driven by the million in savings realized in the latter half of the year after the reduction in force that we did at the end of the second quarter of fiscal the other factors impacting the decline in spending were million of reduced consulting  consumed materials and allocation of corporate overhead due to being more focused on fine tuning our recent product introductions rather than completely new product development  which did not require as extensive an expenditure level in fiscal in addition to these savings  there was a decline in stock based compensation expense of approximately million that was substantially offset by the cost incurred associated with the reduction in force in fiscal we expect to see a further decline in our research and development spending in fiscal as we realize a full year s cost savings from the reduction in force 

table of contents general and administrative years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands general and administrative expense of revenue pts pts general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
the decline in spending in fiscal is largely due to million of reduced costs associated with the change in ceo that occurred in fiscal we also experienced a reduction of million associated with payroll savings due to the reductions in force that were implemented over the last two fiscal years and a million reduction in professional services due to favorable developments in our outstanding legal matters and reduced accounting fees related to our adoption of fin lastly  we experienced a decline in stock based compensation of million 
see the discussion regarding the changes in stock based compensation  below 
the increase in spending in fiscal was largely due to the costs associated with retirement of our former ceo during fiscal and executive search costs associated with locating a new ceo  which aggregated million 
these increases in spending in fiscal were partially offset by a million decline in variable compensation due to poor company performance in fiscal we expect general and administrative expenses in fiscal to be flat to modestly down due to realizing a full year s savings from the reduction in force completed in mid fiscal as well as other cost saving measures we expect to put in place in fiscal however  one of our stockholders has recently announced his intention to conduct a proxy solicitation to elect himself and one other person proposed by him as directors of ditech networks  which could result in a hostile proxy contest that would result in additional general and administrative expenses 
acquisition related compensation expense in fiscal and  we recorded compensation expense related to the portion of convertible debentures issued to employee stockholders  in connection with the acquisition of jasomi 
we amortized the compensation expense to research and development expense and sales and marketing expense over the lives of the convertible debentures 
the convertible debentures matured in june  and were settled in cash  as such there was no compensation expense associated with the convertible debentures subsequent to fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
convertible debenture amortization included in operating expenses was as follows years ended april  s in thousands sales and marketing research and development total amortization of purchased intangible assets for the years ended april   and  we recorded amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the jasomi acquisition 
we are amortizing purchased intangible assets to operating expense over their estimated useful life which ranges from four to five years

table of contents in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due to the impairment of these assets at the end of fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
years ended april  s in thousands amortization of purchased intangible assets of revenue impairment of goodwill and other purchase intangibles beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced a decline in our stock price and therefore our market capitalization  due in large part to the decline in our operating results 
as a result of our stock price s continued depressed state and uncertainty as to when our stock price would return to levels sufficient to justify the recovery of our recorded goodwill  we undertook an interim impairment review in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the review  we determined that the entire goodwill balance of million  attributable to the jasomi acquisition  was impaired and therefore recorded an impairment loss in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge related to the purchase intangibles related to the jasomi acquisition 
there were no further impairment charges in fiscal the impairment charge was due in large part to declining sales levels in the small customer portion of the session border controller market 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r in fiscal  and was as follows years ended april  ss in thousands cost of goods sold sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total the decline in stock based compensation over the last two fiscal years is due to two key factors 
first and foremost is the reduction in options outstanding and therefore stock compensation linked to the reductions in force that occurred since the end of the second quarter of fiscal the second key element of the decline is linked to the timing of option grants that are subject to accounting under sfas r 
as compensation related to older options  which were granted at higher fair values per share due to the stock price at the time of grant  become fully amortized  they are being replaced by newer option grants which are being issued at lower fair values due to the decline in our stock price 
we expect to continue to experience a declining level of expense related to stock compensation 

table of contents reduction in force and other charge 
year ended april s in thousands cost of goods sold sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total in fiscal  we incurred a charge of million related to the reductions in force and related charges  undertaken in the second and third quarters of fiscal  in an effort to reduce spending levels to coincide with the more recent declines we had experienced in our revenue 
these reductions in force resulted in a reduction in headcount during fiscal as a result of the cumulative reductions in force since the second quarter of fiscal  the charges for fiscal included the estimated costs to vacate approximately of the space in our mountain view headquarters and the cost associated with abandoning certain idled fixed assets  resulting in charges of million and million  respectively 
the space vacated is currently being marketed for sublease 
all severance payments associated with the fiscal reductions in force have been paid 
the only costs remaining to be paid as of april  are estimated outplacement costs for the reductions in force totaling less than million and the balance of the loss on sublease of the vacated space in the mountain view headquarters of million 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we incurred a charge of million related to a reduction in force in an effort to reduce spending levels to coincide with the declines we had experienced in our revenue 
the reduction in force involved the closure of our canadian research and development facility and a reduction of approximately in our worldwide headcount 
during fiscal  approximately  related to accrued outplacement services associated with the fiscal reductions in force lapsed without being used and was therefore reversed to the same financial lines to which it was originally recorded in fiscal all other costs associated with the fiscal reduction in force have been incurred 
in addition to the charge related to the reduction in force  we also incurred other one time benefit costs associated with the retirement package for our ceo in august  which totaled approximately million and was included in general and administrative expense  consistent with the recurring costs associated with the ceo 
total other income expense  net years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands total other income expense  net of revenue pts pts total other income expense  net consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalents and investment balances  offset by other than temporary impairment losses on investment securities and a nominal amount of foreign exchange losses 
the decrease in total other income expense  net in fiscal was largely due to a decline in our invested cash balances and declining average interest rates during fiscal  as well as the further impairment loss on one of our investment securities recognized in fiscal of million 
the decrease in total other income in 
table of contents fiscal was largely due to the decline in our short term investments due to the repurchase of approximately million of our common stock in the latter part of our second quarter of fiscal and recent declines in interest rates along with the recognition of a million impairment loss on investment securities 
our fiscal interest income will be dependent on our cash balances and the movement of us interest rates 
income taxes years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands income taxes of revenue pts pts income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the tax benefit for fiscal resulted in an effective rate of less than 
this rate was largely impacted by the continued recording of full valuation allowances against the future tax benefits from the net operating losses generated during the year 
the other factors impacting the effective tax rate were modest levels of international and state taxes  which are not directly tied to our overall operating loss but rather to the level of profitability in these tax jurisdictions 
the tax provision for fiscal resulted in an effective rate of 
this rate was largely impacted by the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in fiscal of million and the non deductible impairment loss related to goodwill 
the other factors impacting the effective tax rate were modest levels of international and state taxes  which are not directly tied to our overall operating loss but rather to the level of profitability in these tax jurisdictions 
until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  we expect the effective tax rate to be at or close to in fiscal associated with minor levels of taxes for certain state and foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   and  we had cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling million  million and million  respectively 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  and million as of april  as of april   we had no short term investments as compared to million and million as of april  and  respectively 
at april  and  we also had million and million of auction rate securities which had been classified as long term investments  consistent with the maturities of the securities underlying the auction rate instruments  due to uncertainty as to when they may settle 
the decline in our cash and investment balances over the last two years is in large part due to the million used to repurchase our common stock in the second quarter of fiscal and million and million of cash used by operations due to our operating losses during fiscal and  respectively 
as of april   all of our short term and long term investments were held in corporate notes and asset backed auction rate securities 
the long term investments are tied to auction rate securities that failed to settle at auction beginning in fiscal  for which there appears to be no near term market 
although these securities would normally be classified as short term  as they typically settle every days  they have been reclassified to long term pending them settling at auction 
as of june  
table of contents  we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of million 
should we be unsuccessful in migrating to more stable short term investments or should the issuers not refinance the auction rate securities  we could be faced with longer term liquidity issues  which could impact our ability to fund operations beyond the next twelve to eighteen months and could impact our ability to execute on strategic acquisition opportunities 
we have a million line of credit facility with our bank  which expires in july there were no amounts outstanding under the line of credit and we were in compliance with all the financial covenants as of april  since our initial public offering in june  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings in fiscal net cash flows from operating activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities the trend in our cash flows from operations is generally reflective of the downturn in revenue that we have experienced over the last two fiscal years 
although we have attempted to reduce our operating expenses by means of reductions in our workforce and tighter control over discretionary spending during the last two years  the resulting savings in cash outflows have not been sufficient to offset the reduction in cash inflows from collection of declining product revenue 
through our efforts to reduce our spending on operating expenses  we believe that as we are exiting fiscal we have been able to create an environment in which our legacy business in the tdm and voip communications equipment are operating at near cash flow break even and that the level of cash used in operations is primarily linked to the investments we are making in our new toktok and mstage product offerings 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding at april  was approximately days compared to days at april  we expect to see continued modest levels of negative cash flows from operations in the coming year based on expected continued softness in revenue  while continuing to invest in the launch of our new toktok and mstage products 
however  we expect the level of negative cash flows from operations to decline from the levels realized in fiscal and as we realize the savings from our reductions in force over the last two years and as we continue to work down our inventory levels 
net cash flows from investing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands net cash provided by used in investing activities the change in cash flows from investing activities over the years is due to a few key events 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash primarily as a result of the retirement of million 
table of contents of short term investments 
this in flow of cash was partially offset by cash used to purchase million of equipment  primarily in support of our research and development efforts 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash primarily as a result of net maturities of million of short term investments  a large part of the proceeds of which was used to repurchase common stock 
this in flow of cash was partially offset by paying million to jasomi s former non employee investors for principal and interest under the second tranche of the convertible notes issued in the jasomi acquisition 
the payment of the notes held by employee shareholders is included in cash flow from operating activities 
additionally impacting cash flows from investing activities was the purchase of million of equipment  primarily to support our development of the packet voice processor 
we plan to continue to invest in modest levels of capital assets primarily in support of our new product development efforts 
cash flows from financing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands net cash provided by used in financing activities the limited cash flow from financing activities in fiscal and was due to the limited level of option activity during those years largely due to a large portion of the options being out of the money or only marginally in the money due to the decline in our stock price 
the cash flow used in financing activities in fiscal was largely due to the repurchase of over million shares of our common stock 
the cost of the repurchase totaled million 
this use of cash was partially offset by funds received from stock option exercises 
we repurchased no common stock in fiscal or we would expect that cash flows from financing activities will continue to reflect negligible levels of stock option exercises due to the current price of our stock 
we currently do not plan to do any further stock repurchases in an effort to conserve cash 
stock repurchase programs on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common stock under a stock repurchase program 
on august   we filed a tender offer to repurchase up to  shares  or approximately million worth  of our common stock 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the repurchase of  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of million 
the repurchased shares were immediately retired and the aggregate price of the retired shares was reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity 
the purchase price of the shares was allocated between the components of stockholders equity in accordance with the guidance in accounting principles board opinion no 
 status of accounting research bulletins 
commitments we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility lease  and normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet of space in the two buildings that form our mountain view  california headquarters 
in september  we renegotiated our mountain view  california lease  which extended the lease term 
table of contents through july  and reduced the rent cost 
we have engaged a leasing company to sublease approximately  square feet of our mountain view headquarters  which we vacated due to reduced space needs as a result of the cumulative effect of the reductions in force that we have completed since the second quarter of fiscal our contractual commitments as of april   by year in which they become due  are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year to years to years over years operating leases purchase commitments total we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve to eighteen months from our existing cash and short term investments and our million operating line of credit with our bank 
the ability to fund our operations beyond the next twelve to eighteen months will depend on the overall demand of telecommunications providers for new capital equipment and our ability to access funds invested in auction rate securities see risk factor in item a related to auction rate securities 
should we continue to experience significantly reduced levels of customer demand for our products compared to historical levels of purchases  we could need to find additional sources of cash during the latter part of fiscal or be forced to further reduce our spending levels to protect our cash reserves 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item of sec regulation s k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term and long term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments are primarily maintained at four major financial institutions in the united states 
as of april  and  we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk  and we attempted to achieve this by diversifying our portfolio in a variety of highly rated investment securities that have limited terms to maturity 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but current maturities of less than one year and auction rate securities which prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal management has been able to liquidate on  or day auction cycles  are considered short term investments 
those securities with maturities of greater than one year  including auction rate securities that failed to settle and which based on their nature do not appear likely to settle in the near term  are classified as long term investments 
short and long term investments consist primarily of auction rate securities in asset backed securities and corporate notes 
our investment securities are maintained at two major financial institutions  are classified as available for sale  and are recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
if we sell our investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale took place 
in fiscal  and  we realized no gains or losses on our investments  but we did recognize an impairment charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively on certain of our auction 
table of contents rate securities that failed to settle 
in addition  we have recorded a cumulative unrealized loss of million as of april  on the remaining auction rate security as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments with interest rates that  unless they fail to settle  are reset approximately every  or days 
the underlying securities have contractual maturities which are generally greater than ten years 
the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
typically  the carrying value of auction rate securities approximates fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates 
as of april  and  we held one auction rate security totaling million of par value  which had an original rating at the time we purchased them of aa but is currently rated b b rated ars and has failed to settle at auctions since the second quarter of fiscal as of april   we held one additional auction rate security with a par value of million eight additional auction rate securities with a par value of million as of april  which continues to be rated a a rated ars but failed to settle since the fourth quarter of fiscal while we continue to earn interest on these investments at the maximum contractual rate  the fair value of these auction rate securities no longer approximates par value 
accordingly  we have recorded these investments at a fair value of million as of april  million as of april  
due to the prolonged nature and the severity of the decline in the value of the b rated ars that has failed to settle since the second quarter of fiscal and no clear indication of when it might settle  we determined that the unrealized loss was no longer temporary 
therefore  we have recognized million and a million of impairment charges in fiscal and the fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively  on this auction rate security 
we believe that the million decline in value that we have experienced in the a rated ars as of april   is a temporary event and has been accounted for as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we have concluded that no other than temporary impairment losses occurred for the a rated ars that began to fail to settle in fourth quarter of fiscal because we believe that the decline in fair value is due to general market conditions  this investment is of high credit quality  and we have the intent and ability to hold this investment until the anticipated recovery in fair value occurs 
we will continue to analyze our auction rate securities each reporting period for impairment and may be required to recognize an impairment charge in the statement of operations if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the fair value of these securities has been estimated by management based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset in a current transaction  which could change significantly based on market conditions 
our investment securities are not leveraged 
due to the short term nature of our investments  including our ars the interest rates of which reset every to days  they are not subject to significant fluctuations in their fair value due to changes in interest rates 
as such  the recorded fair value of the investments at april  and approximates the fair value after assuming a hypothetical shift in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps over the remaining life of the investments  which shifts are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
bps equals
