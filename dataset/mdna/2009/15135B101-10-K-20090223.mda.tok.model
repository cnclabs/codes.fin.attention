item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  our new jersey health plan operations are presented as discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated financial statements beginning with this annual report on form k 
the following discussion and analysis is presented primarily in the context of continuing operations unless otherwise identified 
for the year ended december   our revenues  total cash flow from operations  and net earnings were billion  million and million  respectively 
our medicaid managed care segment membership totaled approximately million as of december   while our specialty services segment external membership totaled  we currently have health plan subsidiaries offering healthcare services in arizona  georgia  indiana  ohio  south carolina  texas and wisconsin  as well as new jersey 
additionally  effective in july  we acquired a minority interest in access health solutions  llc  or access  which provides managed care on a non risk basis for medicaid recipients in florida 
in february  we began operations in florida through our wholly owned subsidiary  sunshine state health plan  inc we provide member focused services through locally based staff by assisting in accessing care  coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions 
we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality  appropriate healthcare services 
we believe our local approach to managing our health plans  including provider and member services  enables us to provide accessible  quality  culturally sensitive healthcare coverage to our communities 
our health management  educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate  medically necessary services and effective management of routine  severe and chronic health problems  resulting in better health outcomes 
we combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance  information systems and claims processing 
our initial health plan commenced operations in wisconsin in we were organized in wisconsin in as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in delaware in our corporate office is located at carondelet avenue  st 
louis  missouri  and our telephone number is our stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol cnc 
industry we provide our services to organizations and individuals primarily through medicaid  schip  foster care and abd programs 
the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  estimated the total medicaid market was approximately billion in  and estimate the market will grow to billion by according to the most recent information provided by the kaiser commission on medicaid and the uninsured  medicaid spending increased by in fiscal and states appropriated an increase of for medicaid in fiscal budgets 
established in  medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the united states  and provides health insurance to low income families and individuals with disabilities 
authorized by title xix of the social security act  medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states 
the majority of funding is provided at the federal level 
each state establishes its own eligibility standards  benefit packages  payment rates and program administration within federal standards 
as a result  there are medicaid programs one for each us state  each us territory and the district of columbia 
many states have selected medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs  including states that automatically enroll medicaid recipients who don t select a health plan 
we refer to these states as mandated managed care states 
eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets  often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level 
historically  children have represented the largest eligibility group 
established in  and authorized by title xvi of the social security act  abd covers low income persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments 
abd beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all medicaid recipients 
in addition  abd recipients typically utilize more services because of their critical health issues 
the balanced budget act of created schip to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for medicaid  yet not enough to afford private health insurance 
some states include the parents of these children in their schip programs 
schip is the single largest expansion of health insurance coverage for children since the enactment of medicaid 
costs related to the largest eligibility group  children  are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care 
these costs tend to be more predictable than other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population 
a portion of medicaid beneficiaries are dual eligibles  low income seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both medicaid and medicare 
according to cms  there were approximately seven million dual eligible enrollees in these dual eligibles may receive assistance from medicaid for medicaid benefits  such as nursing home care and or assistance with medicare premiums and cost sharing 
dual eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues 
we serve dual eligibles through our abd and long term care programs  and beginning in  through special needs plans 
while medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage  they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the medicaid population tends to access healthcare 
medicaid recipients in non managed care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions  such as asthma and diabetes 
rather  they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency rooms  which tends to be more expensive 
as a result  many states have found that the costs of providing medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory 
since the early s  increasing healthcare costs  combined with significant growth in the number of medicaid recipients  have led many states to establish medicaid managed care initiatives 
additionally  a number of states are designing programs to cover the rising number of uninsured americans 
the us census bureau estimated there were million americans in that lacked health insurance 
continued pressure on states medicaid budgets should cause public policy to recognize the value of managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and effectively controlling costs 
a growing number of states have mandated that their medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans 
other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach 
as a result  a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socio economic  cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the medicaid  schip  foster care and abd populations 
we believe our approach and strategy enable us to be a growing participant in this market 
our competitive strengths our multi line managed care approach is based on the following key attributes strong historic operating performance 
we have increased revenues as we have grown in existing markets  expanded into new markets and broadened our product offerings 
we entered the wisconsin market in  the indiana market in  the texas market in  the ohio market in  the georgia market in  and the south carolina market in we have increased our membership through participation in new programs in existing states 
for example  in  we began operations in the texas foster care program and began serving acute care members in the yavapai county of arizona 
we have also increased membership by acquiring medicaid businesses  contracts and other related assets from competitors in existing markets  most recently in south carolina in our medicaid managed care membership totaled approximately million as of december  for the year ended december   we had revenues of billion  representing a compound annual growth rate  or cagr  since the year ended december  we generated total cash flow from operations of million and net earnings of million for the year ended december  medicaid expertise 
over the last years  we have strived to develop a specialized medicaid expertise that has helped us establish and maintain relationships with members  providers and state governments 
we have implemented programs developed to achieve savings for state governments and improve medical outcomes for members by reducing inappropriate emergency room use  inpatient days and high cost interventions  as well as by managing care of chronic illnesses 
our experience in working with state regulators helps us implement and deliver programs and services efficiently and affords us opportunities to provide input regarding medicaid industry practices and policies in the states in which we operate 
we work with state agencies on redefining benefits  eligibility requirements and provider fee schedules in order to maximize the number of uninsured individuals covered through medicaid  schip  foster care and abd and expand these types of benefits offered 
our approach is to accomplish this while maintaining adequate levels of provider compensation and protecting our profitability 

table of contents diversified business lines 
we continue to broaden our service offerings to address areas that we believe have been traditionally underserved by medicaid managed care organizations 
in addition to our medicaid and medicaid related managed care services  our service offerings include behavioral health  individual health insurance  life and health management  long term care programs  managed vision  nurse triage and pharmacy benefits management 
through the utilization of a multi business line approach  we are able to diversify our revenues and help control our medical costs 
localized approach with centralized support infrastructure 
we take a localized approach to managing our subsidiaries  including provider and member services 
this approach enables us to facilitate access by our members to high quality  culturally sensitive healthcare services 
our systems and procedures have been designed to address these community specific challenges through outreach  education  transportation and other member support activities 
for example  our community outreach programs work with our members and their communities to promote health and self improvement through employment and education on how best to access care 
we complement this localized approach with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance  information systems and claims processing  which allows us to minimize general and administrative expenses and to integrate and realize synergies from acquisitions 
we believe this combined approach allows us to efficiently integrate new business opportunities in both medicaid and specialty services while maintaining our local accountability and improved access 
specialized and scalable systems and technology 
through our specialized information systems  we work to strengthen relationships with providers and states which help us grow our membership base 
we continue to develop our specialized information systems which allow us to support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases  designed to be both replicable and scalable 
physicians can use claims  utilization and membership data to manage their practices more efficiently  and they also benefit from our timely payments 
state agencies can use data from our information systems to demonstrate that their medicaid populations receive quality healthcare in an efficient manner 
these systems also help identify needs for new healthcare and specialty programs 
we have the ability to leverage our platform for one state configuration into new states or for health plan acquisitions 
our ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multi state service area in a cost effective manner 
our business strategy our objective is to become the leading multi line healthcare enterprise focusing on the uninsured population and state funded healthcare initiatives 
we intend to achieve this objective by implementing the following key components of our strategy increase penetration of existing state markets 
we seek to continue to increase our medicaid membership in states in which we currently operate through alliances with key providers  outreach efforts  development and implementation of community specific products and acquisitions 
in  we were awarded two regions in connection with ohio s statewide restructuring of its medicaid managed care program  expanding the number of counties we serve from three to we also were awarded a medicaid abd contract in four regions in ohio 
in texas  we expanded our operations to the corpus christi market in  began managing care for abd recipients in february and began operations in the foster care program in april in arizona  we began serving members within a long term care plan in and within an acute care plan in in  we began serving medicare members within special needs plans in arizona  ohio  texas and wisconsin 
we may also increase membership by acquiring medicaid businesses  contracts and other related assets from our competitors in our existing markets or by enlisting additional providers 
for example  in and  we acquired certain medicaid related assets in ohio 
diversify business lines 
we seek to broaden our business lines into areas that complement our existing business to enable us to grow and diversify our revenue 
we are constantly evaluating new opportunities for expansion both domestically and abroad 
for instance  in july  we completed the acquisition of celtic insurance company  or celtic  a national individual health insurance provider  in october  we commenced operations under our managed care program contracts to provide long term care services in arizona  and in january  we completed the acquisition of us script  a pharmacy benefits manager 
we are also considering other premium based or fee for service lines of business that would provide additional diversity 
we employ a disciplined acquisition strategy that is based on defined criteria including internal rate of return  accretion to earnings per share  market leadership and compatibility with our information systems 
we engage our executives in the relevant operational units or functional areas to ensure consistency between the diligence and integration process 
address emerging state needs 
we work to assist the states in which we operate in addressing the operating challenges they face 
we seek to assist the states in balancing premium rates  benefit levels  member eligibility  policies and practices  and provider compensation 
for example  in  we began operating under a contract with the texas health and human services commission for comprehensive health care for children in foster care  a new statewide program providing managed care services to participants in the texas foster care program 
in  we began performing under our contracts with the state of arizona to facilitate the delivery of mental health and substance abuse services to behavioral health recipients in arizona 
effective january   we were awarded a behavioral health contract to serve schip members in kansas 
by helping states structure an appropriate level and range of medicaid  schip and specialty services  we seek to ensure that we are able to continue to provide those services on terms that achieve targeted gross margins  provide an acceptable return and grow our business 
develop and acquire additional state markets 
we continue to leverage our experience to identify and develop new markets by seeking both to acquire existing business and to build our own operations 
we expect to focus expansion in states where medicaid recipients are mandated to enroll in managed care organizations  because we believe member enrollment levels are more predictable in these states 
for example  effective june   we began managing care for medicaid and schip members in georgia 
in addition  we focus our attention on states converting to a full risk  managed care model 
for example  in  we entered the south carolina market and we participated in the state s conversion to at risk managed care 
in february  we began managed care operations in florida through conversion of members in certain counties from access health solutions to at risk managed care in sunshine state health plan  through our new state contract 
leverage established infrastructure to enhance operating efficiencies 
we intend to continue to invest in infrastructure to further drive efficiencies in operations and to add functionality to improve the service provided to members and other organizations at a low cost 
our centralized functions enable us to add members and markets quickly and economically 
maintain operational discipline 
we monitor our cost trends  operating performance  regulatory relationships and the medicaid political environment in our existing markets 
we seek to operate in markets that allow us to meet our internal metrics including membership growth  plan size  market leadership and operating efficiency 
we may divest contracts or health plans in markets where the state s medicaid environment  over a long term basis  does not allow us to meet our targeted performance levels 
we use multiple techniques to monitor and reduce our medical costs  including on site hospital review by staff nurses and involvement of medical management and finance personnel in significant cases 
our financial management teams evaluate the financial impact of proposed changes in provider relationships 
we also conduct monthly reviews of member demographics for each health plan 
medicaid managed care health plans we have regulated subsidiaries offering healthcare services in each state we serve 
the table below provides summary data for the state markets we currently serve state local health plan name first year of operations under the company counties served at december  market share membership at december  florida sunshine state health plan georgia peach state health plan indiana managed health services new jersey university health plans ohio buckeye community health plan south carolina absolute total care texas superior healthplan wisconsin managed health services represents medicaid and schip membership as of december  as a percentage of total eligible medicaid and schip members in each state 
abd programs are excluded 
we began membership operations in florida in february in november  we announced our intention to sell university health plans 
as a result  this plan is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements  however as of december   the plan was still operated by centene corporation 

table of contents all of our revenue is derived from operations within the united states and its territories 
we generally receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts 
our medical costs have a seasonality component due to cyclical illness  for example cold and flu season  resulting in higher medical expenses beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing throughout the first quarter of each year 
our managed care subsidiaries in georgia  ohio  and texas had revenues from their respective state governments that each exceeded of our consolidated total revenues in other financial information about our segments is found in note  segment information  of our notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
benefits to states our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs  and from our specialized programs in working with state governments 
among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are significant cost savings compared to state paid reimbursement for services 
we bring bottom line management experience to our health plans 
on the administrative and management side  we bring experience including quality of care improvement methods  utilization management procedures  an efficient claims payment system  and provider performance reporting  as well as managers and staff experienced in using these key elements to improve the quality of and access to care 
data driven approaches to balance cost and verify eligibility

our it department has created mapping translation programs for loading membership and linking membership eligibility status to all of centene s subsystems 
establishment of realistic and meaningful expectations for quality deliverables 
we have collaborated with state agencies in redefining benefits  eligibility requirements and provider fee schedules with the goal of maximizing the number of individuals covered through medicaid  schip  foster care and abd programs 
managed care expertise in government subsidized programs 
our expertise in medicaid has helped us establish and maintain strong relationships with our constituent communities of members  providers and state governments

we continuously endeavor to update our systems and processes to improve the timeliness of our provider payments 
cost saving outreach and specialty programs 
our health plans have adopted a physician driven approach where network providers are actively engaged in developing and implementing healthcare delivery policies and strategies 
this approach is designed to eliminate unnecessary costs  improve services to members and simplify the administrative burdens placed on providers 
responsible collection and dissemination of utilization data 
we gather utilization data from multiple sources  allowing for an integrated view of our members utilization of services 
these sources include medical  vision and behavioral health claims and encounter data  pharmacy data  dental vendor claims and authorization data from the authorization and case management system utilized by us to coordinate care 
timely and accurate reporting 
our information systems have reporting capabilities which have been instrumental in identifying the need for new and or improved healthcare and specialty programs 
for state agencies  our reporting capability is important in demonstrating an auditable program 
member programs and services we recognize the importance of member focused delivery of quality managed care services 
our locally based staff assist members in accessing care  coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions 
while covered healthcare benefits vary from state to state  our health plans generally provide the following services primary and specialty physician care transportation assistance inpatient and outpatient hospital care vision care emergency and urgent care dental care prenatal care immunizations laboratory and x ray services prescriptions and limited over the counter drugs home health and durable medical equipment therapies behavioral health and substance abuse services social work services hour nurse advice line we also provide the following education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality  appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner memberconnections is a community face to face outreach and education program designed to create a link between the member and the provider and help identify potential challenges or risk elements to a member s health  such as nutritional challenges and health education shortcomings

our abd program uses a proprietary assessment tool that effectively identifies barriers to care  unmet functional needs  available social supports and the existence of behavioral health conditions that impede a member s ability to maintain a proper health status 
care coordinators develop individual care plans with the member and healthcare providers ensuring the full integration of behavioral  social and acute care services 
these care plans  while specific to an abd member  incorporate condition specific practices in collaboration with physician partners and community resources 

table of contents providers for each of our service areas  we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians  hospitals and ancillary providers 
as of december   the health plans we operated contracted with the following number of physicians and hospitals primary care physicians specialty care physicians hospitals georgia indiana new jersey ohio south carolina texas wisconsin total in november  we announced our intention to sell university health plans 
as a result  this plan is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements  however as of december   the plan was still operated by centene corporation 
our network of primary care physicians is a critical component in care delivery  management of costs and the attraction and retention of new members 
primary care physicians include family and general practitioners  pediatricians  internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists 
specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by the primary care physicians 
specialty care physicians include  but are not limited to  orthopedic surgeons  cardiologists and otolaryngologists 
we also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality  appropriate healthcare services 
our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers 
our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to two year periods and renew automatically for successive one year terms  but generally are subject to termination by either party upon to days prior written notice 
in the absence of a contract  we typically pay providers at state medicaid reimbursement levels 
we pay physicians under a fee for service  capitation arrangement  or risk sharing arrangement 
under our fee for service contracts with physicians  particularly specialty care physicians  we pay a negotiated fee for covered services 
this model is characterized as having no financial risk for the physician 
in addition  this model requires management oversight because our total cost may increase as the units of services increase or as more expensive services replace less expensive services 
we have prior authorization procedures in place that are intended to make sure that certain high cost diagnostic and other services are medically appropriate 
under our capitated contracts  primary care physicians are paid a monthly fee for each of our members assigned to his or her practice and are at risk for all costs associated with primary and specialty physician and emergency room services 
in return for this payment  these physicians provide all primary care and preventive services  including primary care office visits and epsdt services 
if these physicians also provide non capitated services to their assigned members  they may receive payment under fee for service arrangements at standard medicaid rates 
under risk sharing arrangements  physicians are paid under a capitated or fee for service arrangement 
the arrangement  however  contains provisions for additional bonus to the physicians or reimbursement from the physicians based upon cost and quality factors 
we often refer to these arrangements as model contracts 
we work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing financial and utilization information  physician and patient educational programs and disease and medical management programs 
our programs are also designed to help the physicians coordinate care outside of their offices 
in addition  we are governed by state prompt payment policies 
we believe our collaborative approach with physicians gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets 
our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs  managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members  while also simplifying the administrative burdens on our providers 
this approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that  in turn  have helped to increase our membership base 
the following are among the services we provide to support physicians customized utilization reports provide certain of our contracted physicians with information that enables them to run their practices more efficiently and focuses them on specific patient needs 
for example  quarterly detail reports update physicians on their status within their risk pools 
equivalency reports provide physicians with financial comparisons of capitated versus fee for service arrangements 
case management support helps the physician coordinate specialty care and ancillary services for patients with complex conditions and direct members to appropriate community resources to address both their health and socio economic needs 
web based claims and eligibility resources have been implemented in selected markets to provide physicians with on line access to perform claims and eligibility inquiries 
our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members  including the memberconnections  epsdt case management and health management programs 
for example  the memberconnections staff facilitates doctor patient relationships by connecting members with physicians  the epsdt programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease 
where appropriate  our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as behavioral health  health management  managed vision  nurse triage  pharmacy benefit management  and treatment compliance 
when necessary  we also contract with third party providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy  home healthcare  diagnostic laboratory tests  x ray examinations  ambulance services and durable medical equipment 
additionally  we contract with dental vendors in markets where routine dental care is a covered benefit 
quality management our medical management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members 
we employ strategies  including health management and complex case management  that are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders 
this process promotes physician participation and support  both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program 
we have implemented specialized information systems to support our medical quality management activities 
information is drawn from our data warehouse  clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system  to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements 
some examples of these intervention programs include appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit nicu hospital admissions  other inpatient hospital admissions  and observation admissions  in accordance with interqual criteria  tightening of our pre authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment and injectibles 
emergency department ed program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non emergency care away from the costly ed setting through patient education  on site alternative urgent care settings  etc  increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient s specific healthcare needs  incorporation of disease management  which is a comprehensive  multidisciplinary  collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma and diabetes  smart start for your baby  a prenatal case management program aimed at helping women with high risk pregnancies deliver full term  healthy infants 
we provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse 
state and health employer data and information set  or hedis  reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts 
this reporting is monitored by plan quality improvement committees and our corporate medical management team 
in an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks  we undertake to verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by the national committee for quality assurance 

table of contents information technology the ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multi state service area in a cost effective manner 
our centralized information systems  which are located in st 
louis  missouri  support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions 
we continue to enhance our systems in order to leverage the platform we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions 
our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans 
our membership and claims processing system is capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner 
we have a disaster recovery and business resumption plan developed and implemented in conjunction with a third party 
this plan allows us complete access to the business resumption centers and hot site facilities provided by the plan

the audit committee and the board of directors review a compliance report on a quarterly basis 
competition we continue to face varying and increasing levels of competition as we expand in our existing service areas or enter new markets  as federal regulations require at least two competitors in each service area 
healthcare reform proposals may cause a number of commercial managed care organizations to decide to enter or exit the medicaid market 
in our business  our principal competitors for state contracts  members and providers consist of the following types of organizations medicaid managed care organizations focus on providing healthcare services to medicaid recipients 
these organizations consist of national and regional organizations  as well as smaller organizations that operate in one city or state and are owned by providers  primarily hospitals 
national and regional commercial managed care organizations have medicaid members in addition to members in private commercial plans 
some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management  behavioral health management  health management  and nurse triage call support centers 
primary care case management programs are programs established by the states through contracts with primary care providers 
under these programs  physicians provide primary care services to medicaid recipients  as well as limited medical management oversight 
we compete with other managed care organizations and specialty companies for state contracts 
in order to grant a contract  state governments consider many factors 
these factors include quality of care  financial requirements  an ability to deliver services and establish provider networks and infrastructure 
in addition  our specialty companies also compete with other providers  such as disease management companies  individual health insurance companies  and pharmacy benefits managers for non governmental contracts 

table of contents we also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members 
people who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered  ease of access to services  a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits 
in certain markets  where recipients select a physician instead of a health plan  we are able to grow our membership by adding new physicians to our provider base 
we also compete with other managed care organizations to enter into contracts with physicians  physician groups and other providers 
we believe the factors that providers consider in deciding whether to contract with us include existing and potential member volume  reimbursement rates  medical management programs  speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities 
see risk factors competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 
regulation our healthcare and specialty operations are regulated at both state and federal levels 
government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically 
our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as health maintenance organizations and or insurance companies in their respective states 
in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  we are regulated by the relevant health  insurance and or human services departments that oversee the activities of managed care organizations providing or arranging to provide services to medicaid enrollees 
the process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization is complex and requires demonstration to the regulators of the adequacy of the health plan s organizational structure  financial resources  utilization review  quality assurance programs  complaint procedures  provider network adequacy and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions 
under both state managed care organization statutes and state insurance laws  our health plan subsidiaries  as well as our specialty companies  must comply with minimum statutory capital requirements or other financial requirements  such as deposit and reserve requirements 
insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organizations businesses and the payment of dividends  as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds 
our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic reporting requirements 
in addition  each health plan and individual health insurance provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing operational changes  including the development of new product offerings and  in some states  the expansion of service areas 
states have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations 
these regulations in certain states include premium and maintenance taxes  stringent prompt pay laws  requirements of national provider identifier numbers on claim submittals  disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures  and programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups 
state contracts in order to be a medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate  we must operate under a contract with the state s medicaid agency 
states generally use either a formal proposal process  reviewing a number of bidders  or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program 
we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis 
these rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state 
our contracts with the states and regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the medicaid sector  including provisions relating to eligibility  enrollment and disenrollment processes  health education and wellness and prevention programs  covered services  timeliness of claims payment  eligible providers  financial standards  subcontractors  safeguarding of member information  record keeping and record retention  fraud and abuse detection and reporting  periodic financial and informational reporting  grievance procedures  and quality assurance  organization and administrative systems 
a health plan or individual health insurance providers compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by cms 
a health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third party reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan 
a health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies  including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports

hipaa in  congress enacted the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
the act is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage and simplify the administration of health insurance claims 
among the main requirements of hipaa are standards for the processing of health insurance claims and related transactions 
the regulation s requirements apply to transactions conducted using electronic media 
since electronic media is defined broadly to include transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using magnetic tape  disk or compact disk media  many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted 
under the hipaa regulations  health plans are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format 
penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements 

table of contents hipaa regulations also protect the privacy of medical records and other personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers  health plans and healthcare clearinghouses 
we have implemented processes  policies and procedures to comply with the hipaa privacy regulations  including education and training for employees 
in addition  the corporate privacy officer and health plan privacy officials serve as resources to employees to address any questions or concerns they may have 
among numerous other requirements  the privacy regulations limit certain uses and disclosures of private health information  and require patient authorizations for such uses and disclosures of private health information  guarantee patients rights to access their medical records and to know who else has accessed them  limit most disclosure of health information to the minimum needed for the intended purpose  establish procedures to ensure the protection of private health information  authorize access to records by researchers and others  and impose criminal and civil sanctions for improper uses or disclosures of health information 
the preemption provisions of hipaa provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements 
in addition  the secretary of hhs may grant exceptions allowing state laws to prevail if one or more of a number of conditions are met  including but not limited to the following the state law is necessary to prevent fraud and abuse associated with the provision of and payment for healthcare  the state law is necessary to ensure appropriate state regulation of insurance and health plans  the state law is necessary for state reporting on healthcare delivery or costs  or the state law addresses controlled substances 
in  hhs published final regulations relating to the security of electronic individually identifiable health information 
compliance with these regulations was required by april these regulations require healthcare providers  health plans and healthcare clearinghouses to implement administrative  physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of such information when it is electronically stored  maintained or transmitted through such devices as user authentication mechanisms and system activity audits 
in addition  numerous states have adopted personal data security laws that provide for  among other things  private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization 
patients rights legislation the united states senate and house of representatives passed different versions of patients rights legislation in both versions included provisions that specifically apply protections to participants in federal healthcare programs  including medicaid beneficiaries 
although no such federal legislation has been enacted  patients rights legislation is frequently proposed in congress 
if enacted  this type of legislation could expand our potential exposure to lawsuits and increase our regulatory compliance costs 
depending on the final form of any enacted patients rights legislation  such legislation could  among other things  expose us to liability for economic and punitive damages for making determinations that deny benefits or delay beneficiaries receipt of benefits as a result of our medical necessity or other coverage determinations 
we cannot predict when or whether patients rights legislation will be enacted into law or  if enacted  what final form such legislation might take 
other fraud and abuse laws investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud and abuse became a top priority for law enforcement entities in the last decade 
the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in public government healthcare programs such as medicaid 
the laws and regulations relating to medicaid fraud and abuse and the contractual requirements applicable to health plans participating in these programs are complex and changing and may require substantial resources 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
none of our employees are represented by a union 
we believe our relationships with our employees are good

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  in which case you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information in this filing  including our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect our company 
risks related to being a regulated entity reduction in medicaid  schip and abd funding could substantially reduce our profitability 
most of our revenues come from medicaid  schip and abd premiums 
the base premium rate paid by each state differs  depending on a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits  a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix and member eligibility categories 
future levels of medicaid  schip and abd funding and premium rates may be affected by continuing government efforts to contain healthcare costs and may further be affected by state and federal budgetary constraints 
additionally  state and federal entities may make changes to the design of their medicaid programs resulting in the cancellation or modification of these programs 
for example  in august  the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  published a final rule regarding the estimation and recovery of improper payments made under medicaid and schip 
this rule requires a cms contractor to sample selected states each year to estimate improper payments in medicaid and schip and create national and state specific error rates 
states must provide information to measure improper payments in medicaid and schip for managed care and fee for service 
each state will be selected for review once every three years for each program 
states are required to repay cms the federal share of any overpayments identified 
the american reinvestment and recovery act of  which was signed into law on february   provides billion in additional federal medicaid funding for states medicaid expenditures between october  and december  under this act  states meeting certain eligibility requirements will temporarily receive additional money in the form of an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage fmap 
thus  for a limited period of time  the share of medicaid costs that are paid for by the federal government will go up  and each state s share will go down 
we cannot predict whether states are  or will remain  eligible to receive the additional federal medicaid funding  or whether the states will have sufficient funds for their medicaid programs 
states also periodically consider reducing or reallocating the amount of money they spend for medicaid  schip  foster care and abd 
in recent years  the majority of states have implemented measures to restrict medicaid  schip  foster care and abd costs and eligibility 
changes to medicaid  schip  foster care and abd programs could reduce the number of persons enrolled in or eligible for these programs  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or healthcare costs under these programs  all of which could have a negative impact on our business 
we believe that reductions in medicaid  schip  foster care and abd payments could substantially reduce our profitability 
further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 
if schip is not reauthorized or states face shortfalls  our business could suffer 
federal support for schip has been authorized through we cannot be certain that schip will be reauthorized when current funding expires in  and if it is  what changes might be made to the program following reauthorization 
thus  we cannot predict the impact that reauthorization will have on our business 
states receive matching funds from the federal government to pay for their schip programs  which matching funds have a per state annual cap 
because of funding caps  there is a risk that these states could experience shortfalls in future years  which could have an impact on our ability to receive amounts owed to us from states in which we have schip contracts 
if any of our state contracts are terminated or are not renewed  our business will suffer 
we provide managed care programs and selected services to individuals receiving benefits under federal assistance programs  including medicaid  schip and abd 
we provide those healthcare services under contracts with regulatory entities in the areas in which we operate 
our contracts with various states are generally intended to run for one or two years and may be extended for one or two additional years if the state or its agent elects to do so 
our current contracts are set to expire or renew between march  and december  when our contracts expire  they may be opened for bidding by competing healthcare providers 
there is no guarantee that our contracts will be renewed or extended 
for example  on august   we received notification from the kansas health policy authority that firstguard health plan kansas  inc s contract with the state would not be renewed or extended  and as a result  our contract ended on december  further  our contracts with the states are subject to cancellation by the state after a short notice period in the event of unavailability of state funds 
for example  the indiana contract under which we operate can be terminated by the state without cause 
our contracts could also be terminated if we fail to perform in accordance with the standards set by state regulatory agencies 
if any of our contracts are terminated  not renewed  renewed on less favorable terms  or not renewed on a timely basis  our business will suffer  and our financial position  results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected 
if we are unable to participate in schip programs  our growth rate may be limited 
schip is a federal initiative designed to provide coverage for low income children not otherwise covered by medicaid or other insurance programs 
the programs vary significantly from state to state 
participation in schip programs is an important part of our growth strategy 
if states do not allow us to participate or if we fail to win bids to participate  our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents changes in government regulations designed to protect the financial interests of providers and members rather than our investors could force us to change how we operate and could harm our business 
our business is extensively regulated by the states in which we operate and by the federal government 
the applicable laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and generally are intended to benefit and protect the financial interests of health plan providers and members rather than investors 
the enactment of new laws and rules or changes to existing laws and rules or the interpretation of such laws and rules could  among other things force us to restructure our relationships with providers within our network  require us to implement additional or different programs and systems  mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues  restrict revenue and enrollment growth  require us to develop plans to guard against the financial insolvency of our providers  increase our healthcare and administrative costs  impose additional capital and reserve requirements  and increase or change our liability to members in the event of malpractice by our providers 
for example  congress has previously considered various forms of patient protection legislation commonly known as the patients bill of rights and such legislation may be proposed again 
we cannot predict the impact of any such legislation  if adopted  on our business 
regulations may decrease the profitability of our health plans 
certain states have enacted regulations which require us to maintain a minimum health benefits ratio  or establish limits on our profitability 
other states require us to meet certain performance and quality metrics in order to receive our full contractual revenue 
in certain circumstances  our plans may be required to pay a rebate to the state in the event profits exceed established levels 
these regulatory requirements  changes in these requirements or the adoption of similar requirements by other regulators may limit our ability to increase our overall profits as a percentage of revenues 
certain states  including but not limited to georgia  indiana  new jersey  texas and wisconsin have implemented prompt payment laws and are enforcing penalty provisions for failure to pay claims in a timely manner 
failure to meet these requirements can result in financial fines and penalties 
in addition  states may attempt to reduce their contract premium rates if regulators perceive our health benefits ratio as too low 
any of these regulatory actions could harm our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
certain states also impose marketing restrictions on us which may constrain our membership growth and our ability to increase our revenues 
we face periodic reviews  audits and investigations under our contracts with state government agencies  and these audits could have adverse findings  which may negatively impact our business 
we contract with various state governmental agencies to provide managed healthcare services 
pursuant to these contracts  we are subject to various reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in cancellation of our contracts  refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our contracts  imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in various markets  increased difficulty in selling our products and services  and loss of one or more of our licenses 
failure to comply with government regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties 
federal and state governments have enacted fraud and abuse laws and other laws to protect patients privacy and access to healthcare 
in some states  we may be subject to regulation by more than one governmental authority  which may impose overlapping or inconsistent regulations 
violation of these and other laws or regulations governing our operations or the operations of our providers could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties  the cancellation of our contracts to provide services  the suspension or revocation of our licenses or our exclusion from participating in the medicaid  schip  foster care and abd programs 
if we were to become subject to these penalties or exclusions as the result of our actions or omissions or our inability to monitor the compliance of our providers  it would negatively affect our ability to operate our business 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  broadened the scope of fraud and abuse laws applicable to healthcare companies 
hipaa created civil penalties for  among other things  billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
hipaa established new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including civil and  in some instances  criminal penalties for failure to comply with specific standards relating to the privacy  security and electronic transmission of most individually identifiable health information 
it is possible that congress may enact additional legislation in the future to increase penalties and to create a private right of action under hipaa  which could entitle patients to seek monetary damages for violations of the privacy rules 
we may incur significant costs as a result of compliance with government regulations  and our management will be required to devote time to compliance 
many aspects of our business are affected by government laws and regulations 
the issuance of new regulations  or judicial or regulatory guidance regarding existing regulations  could require changes to many of the procedures we currently use to conduct our business  which may lead to additional costs that we have not yet identified 
we do not know whether  or the extent to which  we will be able to recover from the states our costs of complying with these new regulations 
the costs of any such future compliance efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have already expended significant time  effort and financial resources to comply with the privacy and security requirements of hipaa 
we cannot predict whether states will enact stricter laws governing the privacy and security of electronic health information 
if any new requirements are enacted at the state or federal level  compliance would likely require additional expenditures and management time 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the new york stock exchange  or the nyse  have imposed various requirements on public companies  including requiring changes in corporate governance practices 
our management and other personnel will continue to devote time to these compliance initiatives 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 
in particular  we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over our financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
our testing  or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm  may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses 
our compliance with section causes us to incur substantial expense and management effort 
moreover  if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section  or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses  the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nyse  sec or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
changes in healthcare law and benefits may reduce our profitability 
numerous proposals relating to changes in healthcare law have been introduced  some of which have been passed by congress and the states in which we operate or may operate in the future 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and interpretations of existing laws and rules may also change from time to time 
we are unable to predict what regulatory changes may occur or what effect any particular change may have on our business 
for example  these changes could reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll in medicaid  reduce the reimbursement or payment levels for medical services or reduce benefits included in medicaid coverage 
we are also unable to predict whether new laws or proposals will favor or hinder the growth of managed healthcare in general 
legislation or regulations that require us to change our current manner of operation  benefits provided or our contract arrangements may seriously harm our operations and financial results 

table of contents for example  in august cms issued guidance that imposes requirements on states that cover children in families with incomes above of the federal poverty level 
under these requirements  applicable states must provide assurances to cms that the state has enrolled at least of the medicaid and schip eligible children in the state who are in families with incomes below of the federal poverty level in medicaid or schip and that the number of children insured through private employers has not decreased by more than two percentage points over the prior five year period 
two states in which we have schip contracts  georgia and new jersey  are subject to these requirements 
if they are unable to meet these requirements  they will be unable to continue to cover children in families with incomes above of the federal poverty level  which would likely decrease our membership in such states 
many states object to these requirements as unduly burdensome and likely to result in a decrease in the number of children covered by schip  and some states  including new jersey  are pursuing legal challenges against cms in relation to these requirements 
in the guidance  cms stated that it expected states to comply with the requirements within months of the issuance of the guidance 
however  in august  a cms spokesperson stated that  for the time being  cms would not take compliance action to enforce this requirement 
further  on february   president obama issued a memorandum to the secretary of health and human services requesting the immediate withdrawal of the august guidance and implementation of schip without the requirements imposed by the august guidance 
we cannot predict whether legal challenges to august guidance will be successful or whether these requirements will be rescinded by cms 
we cannot predict the impact these requirements will have on our revenue if changes are implemented in states in which we serve schip beneficiaries 
if a state fails to renew a required federal waiver for mandated medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied  our membership in that state will likely decrease 
states may administer medicaid managed care programs pursuant to demonstration programs or required waivers of federal medicaid standards 
waivers and demonstration programs are generally approved for two year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies 
we have no control over this renewal process 
if a state does not renew such a waiver or demonstration program or the federal government denies a state s application for renewal  membership in our health plan in the state could decrease and our business could suffer 
changes in federal funding mechanisms may reduce our profitability 
the bush administration previously proposed a major long term change in the way medicaid and schip are funded 
the proposal  if adopted  would allow states to elect to receive  instead of federal matching funds  combined medicaid schip allotments for acute and long term healthcare for low income  uninsured persons 
participating states would be given flexibility in designing their own health insurance programs  subject to federally mandated minimum coverage requirements 
it is uncertain whether this proposal will be enacted 
accordingly  it is unknown whether or how many states might elect to participate or how their participation may affect the net amount of funding available for medicaid and schip programs 
if such a proposal is adopted and decreases the number of persons enrolled in medicaid or schip in the states in which we operate or reduces the volume of healthcare services provided  our growth  operations and financial performance could be adversely affected 
on may   cms issued a final rule that would reduce states use of intergovernmental transfers for the states share of medicaid program funding 
by restricting the use of intergovernmental transfers  this rule may restrict some states funding for medicaid  which could adversely affect our growth  operations and financial performance 
on may   president bush signed an iraq war supplemental spending bill that included a one year moratorium on the effectiveness of the final rule 
on june   president bush signed another iraq war supplemental spending bill that extends the moratorium on the effectiveness of the final rule until april  we cannot predict whether the rule will ever be implemented and if it is  what impact it will have on our business 
recent legislative changes in the medicare program may also affect our business 
for example  the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of revised cost sharing requirements for some beneficiaries and requires states to reimburse the federal medicare program for costs of prescription drug coverage provided to beneficiaries who are enrolled simultaneously in both the medicaid and medicare programs 
in its fiscal year budget proposal  the bush administration has also proposed to further reduce total federal funding for the medicaid program by billion over the next five years 
these changes may reduce the availability of funding for some states medicaid programs  which could adversely affect our growth  operations and financial performance 
in addition  the medicare prescription drug benefit interrupted the distribution of prescription drugs to many beneficiaries simultaneously enrolled in both medicaid and medicare  prompting several states to pay for prescription drugs on an unbudgeted  emergency basis without any assurance of receiving reimbursement from the federal medicaid program 
these expenses may cause some states to divert funds originally intended for other medicaid services which could adversely affect our growth  operations and financial performance 
if state regulatory agencies require a statutory capital level higher than the state regulations  we may be required to make additional capital contributions 
our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include health maintenance organizations  or hmos  and managed care organizations  or mcos 
hmos and mcos are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state 
additionally  state regulatory agencies may require  at their discretion  individual hmos to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
if this were to occur to one of our subsidiaries  we may be required to make additional capital contributions to the affected subsidiary 
any additional capital contribution made to one of the affected subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to grow 
if state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries to us  we may not have sufficient funds to implement our business strategy 
we principally operate through our health plan subsidiaries 
if funds normally available to us become limited in the future  we may need to rely on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries to fund our operations 
these subsidiaries are subject to regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that can be paid to us without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
if these regulators were to deny our subsidiaries request to pay dividends to us  the funds available to us would be limited  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
risks related to our business ineffectiveness of state operated systems and subcontractors could adversely affect our business 
our health plans rely on other state operated systems or sub contractors to qualify  solicit  educate and assign eligible members into the health plans 
the effectiveness of these state operations and sub contractors can have a material effect on a health plan s enrollment in a particular month or over an extended period 
when a state implements new programs to determine eligibility  new processes to assign or enroll eligible members into health plans  or chooses new contractors  there is an increased potential for an unanticipated impact on the overall number of members assigned into the health plans 
failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our medical expense includes claims reported but not yet paid  or inventory  estimates for claims incurred but not reported  or ibnr  and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period 
our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available 
as more complete information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimate  and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 
we can not be sure that our medical claims liability estimates are adequate or that adjustments to those estimates will not unfavorably impact our results of operations 
for example  in the three months ended june  we adjusted ibnr by million for adverse medical costs development from the first quarter of 
table of contents additionally  when we commence operations in a new state or region  we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability 
for example  we commenced operations in south carolina in december and began our foster care program in texas in april for a period of time after the inception of business in these states  we based our estimates on state provided historical actuarial data and limited actual incurred and received claims 
from time to time in the past  our actual results have varied from our estimates  particularly in times of significant changes in the number of our members 
the accuracy of our medical claims liability estimate may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions  further harming our results 
receipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums would negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
our premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries 
these premiums are fixed by contract  and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide healthcare services as established by the state governments 
we use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of healthcare services delivered to our members 
if premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise  our earnings will be affected negatively 
in addition  our actual medical services costs may exceed our estimates  which would cause our health benefits ratio  or our expenses related to medical services as a percentage of premium revenue  to increase and our profits to decline 
in addition  it is possible for a state to increase the rates payable to the hospitals without granting a corresponding increase in premiums to us 
if this were to occur in one or more of the states in which we operate  our profitability would be harmed 
in addition  if there is a significant delay in our receipt of premiums to offset previously incurred health benefits costs  our earnings could be negatively impacted 
in some instances  our base premiums are subject to an adjustment  or risk score  based on the acuity of our membership 
generally  the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state s medicaid membership 
the risk score is dependent on several factors including our providers completeness and quality of claims submission  our processing of the claim  submission of the processed claims in the form of encounters to the states encounter systems and the states acceptance and analysis of the encounter data 
if the risk scores assigned to our premiums that are risk adjusted are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of our membership  our earnings will be affected negatively 
failure to effectively manage our medical costs or related administrative costs would reduce our profitability 
our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to predict and effectively manage expenses related to health benefits 
we have less control over the costs related to medical services than we do over our general and administrative expenses 
because of the narrow margins of our health plan business  relatively small changes in our health benefits ratio can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in healthcare regulations and practices  the level of use of healthcare services  hospital costs  pharmaceutical costs  major epidemics  new medical technologies and other external factors  including general economic conditions such as inflation levels  are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to predict and effectively control the costs of providing health benefits 
we may not be able to manage costs effectively in the future 
if our costs related to health benefits increase  our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 
our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of long term investments and restricted deposits 
we maintain an investment portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities which may include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds  municipal bonds  corporate bonds  instruments of the us treasury  insurance contracts and equity securities 
these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks 
substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced 
as a result  we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity of our investments  which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
for example  in the third quarter of  we recorded a loss on investments of approximately million due to a loss in a money market fund 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business 
historically  the acquisition of medicaid and specialty services businesses  contract rights and related assets of other health plans both in our existing service areas and in new markets has accounted for a significant amount of our growth 
many of the other potential purchasers have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition  many of the sellers are interested either in a selling  along with their medicaid assets  other assets in which we do not have an interest or b selling their companies  including their liabilities  as opposed to the assets of their ongoing businesses 
we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions 
in the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not currently operate  we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state 
in addition  even if we already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business  we would be required to obtain additional regulatory approval if the acquisition would result in our operating in an area of the state in which we did not operate previously  and we could be required to renegotiate provider contracts of the acquired business 
we cannot provide any assurance that we would be able to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner  or at all 
in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition  state regulators may consider a number of factors outside our control  including giving preference to competing offers made by locally owned entities or by not for profit entities 
we also may be unable to obtain sufficient additional capital resources for future acquisitions 
if we are unable to effectively execute our acquisition strategy  our future growth will suffer and our results of operations could be harmed 
execution of our growth strategy may increase costs or liabilities  or create disruptions in our business 
we pursue acquisitions of other companies or businesses from time to time 
although we review the records of companies or businesses we plan to acquire  even an in depth review of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess fully its capabilities and deficiencies 
as a result  we may assume unanticipated liabilities or adverse operating conditions  or an acquisition may not perform as well as expected 
we face the risk that the returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness incurred to acquire such businesses  or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses 
we also face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions into our existing operations effectively without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
integration may be hindered by  among other things  differing procedures  including internal controls  business practices and technology systems 
we may need to divert more management resources to integration than we planned  which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other profitable activities 
in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions  we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired business or assets with our existing operations 
this may include the integration of additional personnel who are not familiar with our operations and corporate culture  provider networks that may operate on different terms than our existing networks  existing members  who may decide to switch to another healthcare plan  and disparate administrative  accounting and finance  and information systems 
additionally  our growth strategy includes start up operations in new markets or new products in existing markets 
we may incur significant expenses prior to commencement of operations and the receipt of revenue 
as a result  these start up operations may decrease our profitability 
in the event we pursue any opportunity to diversify our business internationally  we would become subject to additional risks  including  but not limited to  political risk  an unfamiliar regulatory regime  currency exchange risk and exchange controls  cultural and language differences  foreign tax issues  and different labor laws and practices 
accordingly  we may be unable to identify  consummate and integrate future acquisitions or start up operations successfully or operate acquired or new businesses profitably 
acquisitions of unfamiliar new businesses could negatively impact our business 
we are subject to the expenditures and risks associated with entering into any new line of business 
our failure to properly manage these expenditures and risks could have a negative impact on our overall business 
for example  effective july  we completed the previously announced acquisition of celtic group  inc  the parent company of celtic insurance company  or celtic 
celtic is a national individual health insurance provider that provides health insurance to individual customers and their families 
while we believe that the addition of celtic will be complementary to our business  we have not previously operated in the individual health care industry 

table of contents if competing managed care programs are unwilling to purchase specialty services from us  we may not be able to successfully implement our strategy of diversifying our business lines 
we are seeking to diversify our business lines into areas that complement our medicaid business in order to grow our revenue stream and balance our dependence on medicaid risk reimbursement 
in order to diversify our business  we must succeed in selling the services of our specialty subsidiaries not only to our managed care plans  but to programs operated by third parties 
some of these third party programs may compete with us in some markets  and they therefore may be unwilling to purchase specialty services from us 
in any event  the offering of these services will require marketing activities that differ significantly from the manner in which we seek to increase revenues from our medicaid programs 
our inability to market specialty services to other programs may impair our ability to execute our business strategy 
failure to achieve timely profitability in any business would negatively affect our results of operations 
start up costs associated with a new business can be substantial 
for example  in order to obtain a certificate of authority in most jurisdictions  we must first establish a provider network  have systems in place and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims 
if we were unsuccessful in obtaining the necessary license  winning the bid to provide service or attracting members in numbers sufficient to cover our costs  any new business of ours would fail 
we also could be obligated by the state to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or recover start up costs 
the expenses associated with starting up a new business could have a significant impact on our results of operations if we are unable to achieve profitable operations in a timely fashion 
we derive a majority of our premium revenues from operations in a small number of states  and our financial position  results of operations or cash flows would be materially affected by a decrease in premium revenues or profitability in any one of those states 
operations in a few states have accounted for most of our premium revenues to date 
if we were unable to continue to operate in any of our current states or if our current operations in any portion of one of those states were significantly curtailed  our revenues could decrease materially 
for example  our medicaid contract with kansas  which terminated december   together with our medicaid contract with missouri  accounted for million in revenue for the year ended december  our reliance on operations in a limited number of states could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly depending on legislative or other governmental or regulatory actions and decisions  economic conditions and similar factors in those states 
our inability to continue to operate in any of the states in which we operate would harm our business 
competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size and quality of provider network  benefits provided and quality of service 
we compete with numerous types of competitors  including other health plans and traditional state medicaid programs that reimburse providers as care is provided 
subject to limited exceptions by federally approved state applications  the federal government requires that there be choices for medicaid recipients among managed care programs 
voluntary programs and mandated competition may limit our ability to increase our market share 
some of the health plans with which we compete have greater financial and other resources and offer a broader scope of products than we do 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the managed care industry  as well as in industries that act as suppliers to us  such as the hospital  physician  pharmaceutical  medical device and health information systems businesses 
to the extent that competition intensifies in any market that we serve  our ability to retain or increase members and providers  or maintain or increase our revenue growth  pricing flexibility and control over medical cost trends may be adversely affected 
in addition  in order to increase our membership in the markets we currently serve  we believe that we must continue to develop and implement community specific products  alliances with key providers and localized outreach and educational programs 
if we are unable to develop and implement these initiatives  or if our competitors are more successful than we are in doing so  we may not be able to further penetrate our existing markets 
if we are unable to maintain relationships with our provider networks  our profitability may be harmed 
our profitability depends  in large part  upon our ability to contract favorably with hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers 
our provider arrangements with our primary care physicians  specialists and hospitals generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon to days prior written notice 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to continue to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts enabling us to service our members profitably 
from time to time providers assert or threaten to assert claims seeking to terminate non cancelable agreements due to alleged actions or inactions by us 
even if these allegations represent attempts to avoid or renegotiate contractual terms that have become economically disadvantageous to the providers  it is possible that in the future a provider may pursue such a claim successfully 
in addition  we are aware that other managed care organizations have been subject to class action suits by physicians with respect to claim payment procedures  and we may be subject to similar claims 
regardless of whether any claims brought against us are successful or have merit  they will still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 
we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
we may be unable to enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our profitability will be harmed 
we may be unable to attract and retain key personnel 
we are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business 
if we lose one or more members of our senior management team  including our chief executive officer  michael f 
neidorff  who has been instrumental in developing our business strategy and forging our business relationships  our business and financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be harmed 
our ability to replace any departed members of our senior management or other key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in the medicaid managed care and specialty services industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand a business such as ours 
competition to hire from this limited pool is intense  and we may be unable to hire  train  retain or motivate these personnel 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry may harm our business and financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the managed care industry has received negative publicity 
this publicity has led to increased legislation  regulation  review of industry practices and private litigation in the commercial sector 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our services  require us to change our services  and increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate 
any of these factors may increase the costs of doing business and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
claims relating to medical malpractice could cause us to incur significant expenses 
our providers and employees involved in medical care decisions may be subject to medical malpractice claims 
in addition  some states  including texas  have adopted legislation that permits managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
claims of this nature  if successful  could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable insurance coverage 
therefore  successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us  our providers or our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and profitability 
even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit  they would still be time consuming and costly and could distract our management s attention 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to operate our business effectively 
loss of providers due to increased insurance costs could adversely affect our business 
our providers routinely purchase insurance to help protect themselves against medical malpractice claims 
in recent years  the costs of maintaining commercially reasonable levels of such insurance have increased dramatically  and these costs are expected to increase to even greater levels in the future 
as a result of the level of these costs  providers may decide to leave the practice of medicine or to limit their practice to certain areas  which may not address the needs of medicaid participants 
we rely on retaining a sufficient number of providers in order to maintain a certain level of service 
if a significant number of our providers exit our provider networks or the practice of medicine generally  we may be unable to replace them in a timely manner  if at all  and our business could be adversely affected 

table of contents growth in the number of medicaid eligible persons during economic downturns could cause our financial position  results of operations or cash flows to suffer if state and federal budgets decrease or do not increase 
less favorable economic conditions may cause our membership to increase as more people become eligible to receive medicaid benefits 
during such economic downturns  however  state and federal budgets could decrease  causing states to attempt to cut healthcare programs  benefits and rates 
we cannot predict the impact of changes in the united states economic environment or other economic or political events  including acts of terrorism or related military action  on federal or state funding of healthcare programs or on the size of the population eligible for the programs we operate 
if federal funding decreases or remains unchanged while our membership increases  our results of operations will suffer 
growth in the number of medicaid eligible persons may be countercyclical  which could cause our financial position  results of operations or cash flows to suffer when general economic conditions are improving 
historically  the number of persons eligible to receive medicaid benefits has increased more rapidly during periods of rising unemployment  corresponding to less favorable general economic conditions 
conversely  this number may grow more slowly or even decline if economic conditions improve 
therefore  improvements in general economic conditions may cause our membership levels to decrease  thereby causing our financial position  results of operations or cash flows to suffer  which could lead to decreases in our stock price during periods in which stock prices in general are increasing 
if we are unable to integrate and manage our information systems effectively  our operations could be disrupted 
our operations depend significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information systems assists us in  among other things  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  and providing data to our regulators 
our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications  claims status and other information 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and regulatory requirements 
moreover  our acquisition activity requires frequent transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly maintain or expand our information systems  we could suffer  among other things  from operational disruptions  loss of existing members and difficulty in attracting new members  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 
in addition  our ability to integrate and manage our information systems may be impaired as the result of events outside our control  including acts of nature  such as earthquakes or fires  or acts of terrorists 
we rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments 
inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations 
premium payments to us are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments 
from time to time  states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program 
alternatively  a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment 
our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we had made related payments to providers and were unable to recoup such payments from the providers 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance 
we maintain liability insurance  subject to limits and deductibles  for claims that could result from providing or failing to provide managed care and related services 
these claims could be substantial 
we believe that our present insurance coverage and reserves are adequate to cover currently estimated exposures 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs or that we will not incur significant liabilities in excess of policy limits 
from time to time  we may become involved in costly and time consuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings  which require significant attention from our management 
we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings  such proceedings are costly and time consuming and require significant attention from our management 
for example  we have in the past  or may be subject to in the future  securities class action lawsuits  irs examinations or similar regulatory actions 
any such matters could harm our business and financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if we are unable to complete the previously announced sale of certain of assets of our new jersey health plan in a timely manner  our business could suffer 
on november   we announced that we had entered into an agreement with amerigroup corporation  or amerigroup  to sell certain assets of our subsidiary university health plan  inc in the state of new jersey to amerigroup 
the agreement contains a number of conditions to closing  including i the approval of regulators in new jersey  ii the lack of a material adverse effect  and iii other customary conditions 
on december   we announced that we had received a termination notice from amerigroup relating to the new jersey transaction 
as we have previously stated  we do not believe that there is cause to terminate the new jersey agreement and are prepared to pursue all available means to bring this transaction to closure 
to this end  on january   we announced that  in response to amerigroup s purported termination of this agreement  we had filed a lawsuit against amerigroup in the superior court of new jersey chancery division 
nonetheless  if we are unable to close the new jersey transaction in a timely manner  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
risks related to our corporate headquarters project could harm our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in  our capital expenditures included million for land and fees associated with the construction of a real estate development on the property adjoining our corporate office  which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business 
we are currently negotiating our involvement as a joint venture partner in an entity that will develop the properties 
due to the global financial crisis and disruptions in the capital and credit markets  we may be unable to complete this project under economically feasible terms 
if the company is unable to complete the development or if the company delays or abandons the real estate project  it may have an adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
for example  in we abandoned a previously planned redevelopment project and recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million 
our operations and efficiency could also be impacted if the development is not completed as there is limited office space for us to expand in the market near our existing headquarters as our business continues to grow

we are currently negotiating our involvement as a joint venture partner in the entity that will develop the relevant properties 
we generally lease space in the states where our health plans  specialty companies and claims processing facilities operate 
we are required by various insurance and regulatory authorities to have offices in the service areas where we provide benefits 
we believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our operational needs for the foreseeable future 

table of contents item legal proceedings on january   we filed a complaint in the chancery division of the superior court of new jersey  asserting a breach of contract claim against amerigroup new jersey  or agpnj  and a tortuous interference with contract claim against amerigroup corporation  in connection with agpnj s refusal to proceed to closing under its contract to purchase certain assets of university health plan s or  uhp s  business 
in december  agpnj sent us a termination notice claiming that a material adverse effect had occurred under the contract and attempted to terminate the contract 
we are contesting whether a material adverse effect occurred and correspondingly the propriety and validity of the purported termination  and are seeking to obtain specific performance of the contract and damages 
we routinely are subjected to legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
while the ultimate resolution of such matters is uncertain  we do not expect the results of any of these matters individually  or in the aggregate  to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

summarized comparative financial data for  and are as follows in millions change change premium premium tax service total revenues medical costs cost of services general and administrative expenses premium tax expense earnings from operations investment and other income  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of income tax benefit expense of  and respectively net earnings loss diluted earnings loss per common share continuing operations discontinued operations total diluted earnings loss per common share 
table of contents revenues and revenue recognition our medicaid managed care segment generates revenues primarily from premiums we receive from the states in which we operate health plans 
we receive a fixed premium per member per month pursuant to our state contracts 
we generally receive premium payments during the month we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
in some instances  our base premiums are subject to an adjustment  or risk score  based on the acuity of our membership 
generally  the risk score is determined by the state analyzing encounter submissions of processed claims data to determine the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state s medicaid membership 
some states enact premium taxes or similar assessments  collectively  premium taxes  and these taxes are recorded as a component of revenues as well as operating expenses 
some contracts allow for additional premium associated with certain supplemental services provided such as maternity deliveries 
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states  which may be adjusted by the states for updates to this data 
these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 
our specialty services segment generates revenues under contracts with state programs  healthcare organizations  and other commercial organizations  as well as from our own subsidiaries 
revenues are recognized when the related services are provided or as ratably earned over the covered period of services 
premium and service revenues collected in advance are recorded as unearned revenue 
for performance based contracts  we do not recognize revenue subject to refund until data is sufficient to measure performance 
premium and service revenues due to us are recorded as premium and related receivables and are recorded net of an allowance based on historical trends and our management s judgment on the collectibility of these accounts 
as we generally receive payments during the month in which services are provided  the allowance is typically not significant in comparison to total revenues and does not have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
our total revenue increased in the year ended december  over the previous year primarily through membership growth in the medicaid managed care segment  premium rate increases  and growth in our specialty services segment 
membership growth from december  to december   we increased our medicaid managed care membership by 
the following table sets forth our membership by state in our medicaid managed care segment december  georgia indiana ohio south carolina texas wisconsin total the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our medicaid managed care segment december  medicaid schip foster care abd medicare total from december  to december  our membership increased as a result of growth in indiana and texas 
in texas  we increased our membership through organic growth of schip  especially in the exclusive provider organization  or epo  market 
in addition  we increased texas membership through our new foster care program  with  members at december  we increased our membership in indiana through temporary eligibility determinations and network expansions 
our membership decreased in wisconsin due to the termination of certain provider contracts 
in south carolina  we continue to add at risk membership as additional counties convert  with  at risk members at december  substantially all of the prior year membership in south carolina was on a non risk basis 
in florida  access served  members on a non risk basis at december  from december  to december   our membership increased primarily as a result of increases in ohio  south carolina and texas 
we increased our medicaid membership in ohio by adding members under our new contract in the northwest region 
we also increased our membership in ohio with the commencement of our new contract to serve aged  blind or disabled members 
our membership in south carolina was primarily on a non risk basis  we began conversion to at risk in december  with at risk members at december  in texas  we increased our membership through new medicaid  schip and abd contracts in the corpus christi  san antonio  austin  and lubbock markets 
our membership decreased in wisconsin because of more stringent state eligibility requirements for the medicaid and schip programs  eligibility administration issues and the termination of certain physician contracts associated with a high cost hospital system 
our membership decreased in indiana primarily due to adjustments made to our provider network made in connection with our new state wide contract as well as the termination of certain non exclusive physician contracts 
in florida  access served  members on a non risk basis at december  the total revenue associated with university health plans included in results from discontinued operations was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
our university health plan membership was   and  at december   and  respectively 
the total revenue associated with firstguard included in results from discontinued operations was  million  and million in  and  respectively 
our firstguard membership was  at december premium rate increases in  we received premium rate increases in some markets which yield a composite increase across all of our markets 
in  we received premium rate increases in some markets which yield a composite increase across all of our markets 
in november  we received a contract amendment from the state of georgia providing for an effective premium rate increase in georgia of approximately effective july  the state also mandated service changes  retroactively recalculated certain rate cells and adjusted for duplicate member issues 
we executed this amendment on november  the state of georgia returned the fully executed contract in january and  accordingly  we recorded the additional revenue  retroactive to july   in the first quarter of this premium revenue  related to the period from july  to december   totals approximately million 
approximately million of this amount is related to the mandated services  rate cell changes and duplicate member issues  the remaining million yields the calculated increase 
specialty services segment growth for the year ended december   specialty services segment revenue from external customers was million compared to million for the same prior year period 
the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of celtic as well as increasing membership for both our behavioral health company  cenpatico  and bridgeway 
the following table sets forth our membership by line of business in our specialty services segment december  cenpatico behavioral health kansas arizona bridgeway long term care acute care 
table of contents operating expenses medical costs our medical costs include payments to physicians  hospitals  and other providers for healthcare and specialty services claims 
medical costs also include estimates of medical expenses incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr  and estimates of the cost to process unpaid claims 
we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required ibnr estimate 
the assumptions we consider include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
our development of the ibnr estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as claims receipts and payment information becomes available 
as more complete information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimate  and include the changes in estimates in medical expense in the period in which the changes are identified 
additionally  we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis 
the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability 
we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability 
we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information  together with management s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for medical costs 
while we believe our ibnr estimate is appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
accordingly  we can not assure you that healthcare claim costs will not materially differ from our estimates 
our results of operations depend on our ability to manage expenses associated with health benefits and to accurately predict costs incurred 
our health benefits ratio  or hbr  represents medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues excluding premium taxes and reflects the direct relationship between the premium received and the medical services provided 
the table below depicts our hbr for our external membership by member category year ended december  medicaid and schip abd and medicare specialty services total our consolidated hbr for the year ended december  was  a decrease of over the decrease for the year ended december  over is due to the effect of recording the georgia premium rate increase retroactive to july  in our consolidated hbr for the year ended december  was  a decrease of over the decrease is primarily attributable to increased premium yield combined with a moderating medical cost trend particularly with a decrease in pharmacy costs  offset by the new abd business in ohio and the transition of these new members into a managed care environment 
cost of services our cost of services expense includes the pharmaceutical costs associated with our pharmacy benefit manager s external revenues 
cost of services also includes all direct costs to support the functions responsible for generation of our services revenues 
these expenses consist of the salaries and wages of the professionals and teachers who provide the services and expenses associated with facilities and equipment used to provide services 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses  or g a  primarily reflect wages and benefits  including stock compensation expense  and other administrative costs associated with our health plans  specialty companies and centralized functions that support all of our business units 
our major centralized functions are finance  information systems and claims processing 
g a increased in both the years ended december  and december  primarily due to expenses for additional facilities and staff to support our growth 
g a also increased in as a result of the acquisition of celtic 
g a in also included charges totaling million for fixed asset impairment  severance for an organizational realignment  and a contribution to our charitable foundation with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of firstguard missouri 
the fixed asset impairment resulted from abandoning a previously planned headquarters development in clayton  missouri 
our g a expense ratio represents g a expenses as a percentage of the sum of premium revenues and service revenues  and reflects the relationship between revenues earned and the costs necessary to earn those revenues 
the consolidated g a expense ratio for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the decrease in the ratio in primarily reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues  partially offset by the effect of the acquisition of celtic and of our start up costs in florida and for our texas foster care product 
the decrease in the ratio in primarily reflects the overall leveraging of our expenses over higher revenues offset by the effect of our start up costs in south carolina and for our texas foster care product  and the million charge discussed above 
other income expense the following table summarizes the components of investment and other income  net year ended december  investment income earnings from equity method investee interest expense investment and other income  net other income expense consists principally of investment income from our cash and investments  our equity in earnings of investments  and interest expense on our debt 
investment income decreased million in  over the comparable periods in the decrease in was due to a loss on investments of million recorded in the third quarter of and an overall decline in market interest rates 
the loss was primarily related to investments in the reserve primary money market fund whose net asset value fell below per share 
the loss represents less than of centene s cash and investment portfolio as of december  we expect to recover of our reserve primary fund investments 
money market funds are generally recorded in cash and cash equivalents in our balance sheet  however  our investment in the reserve primary money market fund is recorded in short term investments due to the restrictions placed on redemptions imposed by the fund 
as of december  we had recovered most of the investment in the reserve primary fund 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in earnings from our equity method investee  access 
investment income increased million in  over the comparable period in the increase was primarily a result of larger investment balances 
interest expense increased in  over the comparable period in due to larger debt balances resulting from our senior notes issuance 
income tax expense our effective tax rate in was compared to in the increase in the current year was due to higher state taxes as a result of a change in the estimated benefit to be realized from new jersey state net operating loss carryforwards 
our effective tax rate was compared to for the corresponding period in the decrease was primarily due to the effect of an increase in tax exempt investment income and lower state taxes 

table of contents discontinued operations in november  we announced our intention to sell certain assets of university health plans  inc  or uhp  our new jersey health plan 
accordingly  the results of operations for uhp are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
uhp was previously reported in the medicaid managed care segment 
in november  we announced a definitive agreement to sell certain assets of our new jersey health plan to amerigroup new jersey  or agpnj 
in december  agpnj sent us a termination notice 
we have filed a complaint seeking specific performance of the contract and damages 
additional information regarding this matter is included in item legal proceedings included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in august  firstguard health plan kansas  inc  or firstguard kansas  our wholly owned subsidiary  received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december  would not be renewed 
in  we also evaluated our strategic alternatives for our firstguard missouri health plan and decided to divest the business 
the sale of the operating assets of firstguard missouri was completed effective february  accordingly  the results of operations for firstguard kansas and firstguard missouri are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
firstguard kansas and firstguard missouri were previously reported in the medicaid managed care segment 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of the discontinued businesses are segregated in the consolidated balance sheet 
net earnings losses from discontinued operations were a net loss of million in compared to earnings of million in and a net loss of million in the results include a one time charge of million primarily for asset impairments and employee severance related to the sale of the new jersey health plan 
at december   the remaining liability for these charges was million 
in  we abandoned the stock of our firstguard health plans resulting in tax benefits of million  net of the associated asset write offs 
the results also included a gain on the sale of firstguard missouri of million  as well as operational and exit costs associated with firstguard 
the results included a firstguard goodwill impairment charge of million  a firstguard intangible asset impairment charge of million  as well as operational and exit costs associated with firstguard 
liquidity and capital resources shown below is a condensed schedule of cash flows for the years ended december   and  that we use throughout our discussion of liquidity and capital resources in millions 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we finance our activities primarily through operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our total operating activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in cash flow from operations in reflected an increase in our medical claims liability as a result of new business in texas  south carolina and arizona 
cash flow from operations also increased by a change in our cash management procedure whereby negative book cash balances resulting from checks issued but not yet presented to our bank for payment are now included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
these factors were partially offset by a decrease in unearned revenue resulting from a timing difference with the receipt of our december revenue for our ohio health plan 
the medical claims liability increased in reflecting new business in ohio and texas  offset by the payment in of firstguard claims incurred in our investing activities used cash of million in  million in and million in cash flows from investing activities in included the purchase price of celtic which we acquired on july   capital expenditures and our investment in the reserve primary fund previously discussed 
at december   our investment in the reserve fund totaled million and was included in short term investments 
our investing activities in consisted primarily of additions to the investment portfolios of our regulated subsidiaries including transfers from cash and cash equivalents to long term investments 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets within our guidelines 
net cash provided by and used in investing activities will fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of investment purchases  sales and maturities 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities with an average duration of years 
cash is invested in investment vehicles such as municipal bonds  corporate bonds  instruments of the us treasury  insurance contracts  commercial paper and equity securities 
these securities generally are actively traded in secondary markets and the reported fair market value is determined based on recent trading activity and other observable inputs 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our regulated subsidiaries may invest their cash 
we spent million  million and million in  and  respectively  on capital assets consisting primarily of software and hardware upgrades  and furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements associated with office and market expansions 
the expenditures in included million for computer hardware and software 
we anticipate spending approximately million on capital expenditures in  primarily associated with system enhancements and market expansions 
in  our capital expenditures included million for land and fees associated with the construction of a real estate development on the property adjoining our corporate office  which we believe is necessary to accommodate our growing business 
we are currently negotiating our involvement as a joint venture partner in an entity that will develop the properties 
if the company is unable to complete the development or if the company delays or abandons the real estate project  it may have an adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our operations and efficiency could also be impacted if the development is not completed as there is limited office space for us to expand in the market near our existing headquarters as our business continues to grow 
our financing activities provided cash of million in  million in and million in during  our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from borrowings under our million credit facility and stock repurchases 
during  our financing activities primarily related to proceeds from issuance of million in senior notes as discussed below 
at december   we had working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  of million  as compared to million at december  we manage our short term and long term investments with the goal of ensuring that a sufficient portion is held in investments that are highly liquid and can be sold to fund short term requirements as needed 
our working capital was negative at december  due to our efforts to increase investment returns through purchases of investments that have maturities of greater than one year and  therefore  are classified as long term 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december  long term investments were million at december  and million at december   including restricted deposits of million and million  respectively 
at december   cash and investments held by our unregulated entities totaled million while cash and investments held by our regulated entities totaled million 
additionally  we held regulated cash and investments of million from discontinued operations 
upon completion of the sale of assets of uhp and the subsequent payment of medical claims liabilites and other liabilities at the closing date  the remaining regulated cash of uhp will be transferred to our unregulated cash 
we have a million revolving credit agreement 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest based upon libor rates  the federal funds rate or the prime rate 
there is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the agreement that ranges from to depending on the total debt to ebitda ratio 
the agreement contains non financial and financial covenants  including requirements of minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  maximum debt to ebitda ratios and minimum net worth 
the agreement will expire in september as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under the agreement and million in letters of credit outstanding  leaving availability of million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april   or the notes 
the notes were registered under the securities act of  pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers 
the indenture governing the notes contains non financial and financial covenants  including requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
interest is paid semi annually in april and october 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
we have a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to four million shares of common stock from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
in october  the repurchase program was extended through october   but we reserve the right to suspend or discontinue the program at any time 
during the year ended december   we repurchased  shares at an average price of 
we have established a trading plan with a registered broker to repurchase shares under certain market conditions 
on july  we completed the acquisition of celtic for a purchase price of approximately million  net of unregulated cash acquired 
concurrent with the acquisition  we received regulatory approval to pay a dividend from celtic to centene in an amount of million  while still maintaining a capital structure we believe to be conservative 
as a result of the dividend  the net effect on our unregulated cash was approximately million 
during the year ended december   we received additional dividends of million from other regulated subsidiaries 
based on our operating plan  we expect that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments  cash from our operations and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to finance our planned acquisition of amerigroup community care of south carolina  our general operations and capital expenditures for at least months from the date of this filing 

table of contents our contractual obligations at december  consisted of medical claims liability  debt  operating leases  purchase obligations  interest on long term debt  unrecognized tax benefits and other long term liabilities 
our debt consists of borrowings from our credit facilities  mortgages and capital leases 
the purchase obligations consist primarily of software purchase and maintenance contracts 
the contractual obligations and estimated period of payment over the next five years and beyond are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years medical claims liability debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations interest on long term debt unrecognized tax benefits other long term liabilities total includes debt related to capital lease obligations 
interest on  senior notes 
unrecognized tax benefits relate to the provision for fasb interpretation no 
includes  separate account liabilities from third party reinsurance that will not be settled in cash 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our medicaid managed care operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as managed care organizations  these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to us 
generally  the amount of dividend distributions that may be paid by a regulated subsidiary without prior approval by state regulatory authorities is limited based on the entity s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital requirements prescribed by various regulatory authorities in each of the states in which we operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries  including uhp  had aggregate statutory capital and surplus of million  compared with the required minimum aggregate statutory capital and surplus requirements of million and we estimate our risk based capital  or rbc  percentage to be of the authorized control level 
the national association of insurance commissioners has adopted rules which set minimum risk based capital requirements for insurance companies  managed care organizations and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage 
as of december   each of our health plans were in compliance with the risk based capital requirements enacted in those states 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations 
the purpose of issuing the statement was to replace current guidance in fasb statement no  business combinations  to better represent the economic value of a business combination transaction 
the changes to be effected with fasb statement no 
r from the current guidance include  but are not limited to acquisition costs will be recognized separately from the acquisition  known contractual contingencies at the time of the acquisition will be considered part of the liabilities acquired and and measured at their fair value  all other contingencies will be part of the liabilities acquired and measured at their fair value only if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of a liability  contingent consideration based on the outcome of future events will be recognized and measured at the time of the acquisition  business combinations achieved in stages step acquisitions will need to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as noncontrolling interests  in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values  and a bargain purchase defined as a business combination in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree will require that excess to be recognized as a gain attributable to the acquirer 
fasb statement no 
r will be effective for any business combinations that occur after january  in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  which was issued to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of financial information provided to investors by requiring all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way  that is  as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  fasb statement no 
eliminates the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
fasb statement no 
will be effective january  the adoption of fasb statement no 
will not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures 
we have determined that all other recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows  or do not apply to our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
our accounting policies regarding medical claims liability and intangible assets are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
medical claims liability our medical claims liability includes claims reported but not yet paid  or inventory  estimates for claims incurred but not reported  or ibnr  and estimates for the costs necessary to process unpaid claims at the end of each period 
we estimate our medical claims liability using actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet actuarial standards of practice 
these actuarial methods consider factors such as historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 

table of contents actuarial standards of practice generally require that the medical claims liability estimates be adequate to cover obligations under moderately adverse conditions 
moderately adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of estimate 
in many situations  the claims amounts ultimately settled will be different than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
we include in our ibnr an estimate for medical claims liability under moderately adverse conditions which represents the risk of adverse deviation of the estimates in our actuarial method of reserving 
we use our judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of the required estimates 
the assumptions we consider when estimating ibnr include  without limitation  claims receipt and payment experience and variations in that experience  changes in membership  provider billing practices  health care service utilization trends  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  prior authorization of medical services  benefit changes  known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza  provider contract changes  changes to medicaid fee schedules  and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims 
we apply various estimation methods depending on the claim type and the period for which claims are being estimated 
for more recent periods  incurred non inpatient claims are estimated based on historical per member per month claims experience adjusted for known factors 
incurred hospital inpatient claims are estimated based on known inpatient utilization data and prior claims experience adjusted for known factors 
for older periods  we utilize an estimated completion factor based on our historical experience to develop ibnr estimates 
the completion factor is an actuarial estimate of the percentage of claims incurred during a given period that have been received or adjudicated as of the reporting period to the estimate of the total ultimate incurred costs 
when we commence operations in a new state or region  we have limited information with which to estimate our medical claims liability 
see risk factors failure to accurately predict our medical expenses could negatively affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
these approaches are consistently applied to each period presented 
additionally  we contract with independent actuaries to review our estimates on a quarterly basis 
the independent actuaries provide us with a review letter that includes the results of their analysis of our medical claims liability 
we do not solely rely on their report to adjust our claims liability 
we utilize their calculation of our claims liability only as additional information  together with management s judgment to determine the assumptions to be used in the calculation of our liability for claims 
our development of the medical claims liability estimate is a continuous process which we monitor and refine on a monthly basis as additional claims receipts and payment information becomes available 
as more complete claim information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the changes are identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with previously reported periods 
we consistently apply our reserving methodology from period to period 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our actuarial model accordingly to establish medical claims liability estimates 
the completion factor  claims per member per month and per diem cost trend factors are the most significant factors affecting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors based on december  data completion factors cost trend factors decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities decrease increase in factors increase decrease in medical claims liabilities in thousands in thousands reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in completion factors 
reflects estimated potential changes in medical claims liability caused by changes in cost trend factors for the most recent periods 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate  it is possible future events could require us to make significant adjustments for revisions to these estimates 
for example  a increase or decrease in our estimated medical claims liability would have affected net earnings by million for the year ended december  the estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our providers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the change in medical claims liability is summarized as follows in thousands year ended december  balance  january acquisitions incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid balance  december claims inventory  december days in claims payable days in claims payable is a calculation of medical claims liability at the end of the period divided by average expense per calendar day for the fourth quarter of each year 
the acquisition in includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of celtic 
the acquisition in includes reserves acquired in connection with our acquisition of opticare 
medical claims are usually paid within a few months of the member receiving service from the physician or other healthcare provider 
as a result  the liability generally is described as having a short tail  which causes less than of our medical claims liability as of the end of any given year to be outstanding the following year 
we believe that substantially all the development of the estimate of medical claims liability as of december  will be known by the end of changes in estimates of incurred claims for prior years are primarily attributable to reserving under moderately adverse conditions 
changes in medical utilization and cost trends and the effect of medical management initiatives may also contribute to changes in medical claim liability estimates 
while we have evidence that medical management initiatives are effective on a case by case basis  medical management initiatives primarily focus on events and behaviors prior to the incurrence of the medical event and generation of a claim 
accordingly  any change in behavior  leveling of care  or coordination of treatment occurs prior to claim generation and as a result  the costs prior to the medical management initiative are not known by us 
additionally  certain medical management initiatives are focused on member and provider education with the intent of influencing behavior to appropriately align the medical services provided with the member s acuity 
in these cases  determining whether the medical management initiative changed the behavior cannot be determined 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the volume of claims that we process  we are unable to practically quantify the impact of these initiatives on our changes in estimates of ibnr 

table of contents the following medical management initiatives may have contributed to the favorable development through lower medical utilization and cost trends appropriate leveling of care for neonatal intensive care unit nicu hospital admissions  other inpatient hospital admissions  and observation admissions  in accordance with interqual criteria 
tightening of our pre authorization list and more stringent review of durable medical equipment dme and injectibles 
emergency department ed program designed to collaboratively work with hospitals to steer non emergency care away from the costly ed setting through patient education  on site alternative urgent care settings  etc 
increase emphasis on case management and clinical rounding where case managers are nurses or social workers who are employed by the health plan to assist selected patients with the coordination of healthcare services in order to meet a patient s specific healthcare needs 
incorporation of disease management which is a comprehensive  multidisciplinary  collaborative approach to chronic illnesses such as asthma 
goodwill and intangible assets we have made several acquisitions that have resulted in our recording of intangible assets 
these intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships  purchased contract rights  provider contracts  trade names and goodwill 
at december   we had million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the following periods intangible asset amortization period purchased contract rights years provider contracts years customer relationships years trade names years our management evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
if the events or circumstances indicate that the remaining balance of the intangible asset or goodwill may be impaired  the potential impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount of the intangible asset or goodwill and the fair value of such asset 
our management must make assumptions and estimates  such as the discount factor  future utility and other internal and external factors  in determining the estimated fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
goodwill is reviewed every year during the fourth quarter for impairment 
in addition  an impairment analysis of intangible assets would be performed based on other factors 
these factors include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks and contracts 
in november  as a result of our decision to divest the new jersey health plan  we concluded it was necessary to conduct an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assts 
as a result of the analysis and expected selling price  we determined that the identifiable intangible assets were not impaired 
in august  firstguard health plan kansas  inc  or firstguard kansas  our wholly owned subsidiary  received notification from the kansas health policy authority that its medicaid contract scheduled to terminate december  would not be renewed 
as a result of these events  we concluded it was necessary to conduct an impairment analysis of the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill of the firstguard reporting unit  which encompasses both the kansas and missouri firstguard health plans 
the fair value of our firstguard reporting unit was determined using discounted expected cash flows and estimated market value 
the impairment analysis resulted in a total non cash intangible asset impairment charge of million  consisting of million of goodwill and million of other identifiable intangible assets  which was recorded in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investments as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million  including restricted deposits of million 
the short term investments generally consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months 
the long term investments consist of municipal  corporate and us agency bonds  life insurance contracts  us treasury investments and equity securities and have maturities greater than one year 
restricted deposits consist of investments required by various state statutes to be deposited or pledged to state agencies 
due to the nature of the states requirements  these investments are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
declines in interest rates over time will reduce our investment income 
for a discussion of the interest rate risk that our investments are subject to  see risk factors risks related to our business our investment portfolio may suffer losses from reductions in market interest rates and changes in market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or liquidity 
inflation while the inflation rate in for medical care costs was slightly less than that for all items  historically inflation for medical care costs has generally exceeded that for all items 
we use various strategies to mitigate the negative effects of healthcare cost inflation 
specifically  our health plans try to control medical and hospital costs through our state savings initiatives and contracts with independent providers of healthcare services 
through these contracted care providers  our health plans emphasize preventive healthcare and appropriate use of specialty and hospital services 
while we currently believe our strategies to mitigate healthcare cost inflation will continue to be successful  competitive pressures  new healthcare and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from healthcare providers and customers  applicable regulations or other factors may affect our ability to control the impact of healthcare cost increases
