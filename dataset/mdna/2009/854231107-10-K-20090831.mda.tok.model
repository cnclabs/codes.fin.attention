item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse commercial and industrial market segments 
we have five reporting segments food service equipment group  air distribution products group adp  engraving group  engineering technologies group  and electronics and hydraulics 
we are a manufacturer of products sold to commercial and industrial customers 
this has enabled us to align all of our businesses with our core manufacturing competencies 
our continuing objective is to identify those of our businesses which hold the greatest potential for profitable growth  and direct our resources to supporting both organic growth and acquisition opportunities in those businesses 
in the recessionary environment in which we have operated during the past year  our focus has been on aggressively reducing the costs throughout all of our operations 
to that end  we have reduced the total size of the us based work force  including both office and shop floor personnel  by approximately during the course of the year 
since the beginning of fiscal we reduced our us based salaried and indirect labor staffing levels by approximately positions resulting in annual savings of approximately million 
in addition  during the third quarter  except where prohibited by collective bargaining agreements  we announced that employee salaries would be frozen and employer contributions to defined contribution plans would be suspended through at least the end of calendar year finally  we have eliminated all annual incentive bonus payments and long term management incentive payouts for fiscal year we also  as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure  have accelerated the implementation of plans to consolidate our global manufacturing footprint as outlined below in our adp group we closed our bartonville  illinois  facility during the first quarter and transferred its production to two of our existing adp facilities 
in our food service equipment group we announced the closure of a facility located in new york in the third quarter and successfully completed the transfer of the production from this facility to our operations in mexico and wyoming 
also during the fourth quarter  we began the consolidation of another food service equipment group facility  the apw wyott facility located in dallas  into our nogales  mexico facility 
we expect to complete this latest consolidation during the first half of in our engraving group  we completed the consolidation of two roll engraving operations into our richmond  virginia facility during the first quarter 
in the third quarter  we consolidated the mold texturizing production at our detroit facility into our facility located in canada 
in our electronics and hydraulics group  we completed the consolidation of the production from our remaining canadian electronics operation into existing facilities located in mexico and china during the fourth quarter 
we also announced the consolidation of the production of the bg labs business which we acquired in august into our facilities in cincinnati  ohio 
this consolidation will be completed in the first quarter of we closed a manufacturing operation in the hydraulics unit during the second quarter and consolidated production into an existing facility 
the annual savings to be achieved by the plant consolidations completed in is estimated to be million 
the food service plant consolidation scheduled to be completed by the end of calendar will yield an estimated additional million in annual savings 
in addition to headcount reductions  we achieved cost reductions in all aspects of procurement including purchase of inventory items  maintenance and repair supplies and services 
we also focused on driving improved productivity from our internal operations including shop floor productivity  reduced scrap and warranty expense and reductions in other controllable expense categories 
in the procurement and productivity cost categories we achieved annual cost savings in excess of million which became fully implemented at the end of the fourth quarter of further  we continue our strong focus on working capital management and cash flow generation with the intent of improving our liquidity and making additional payments on borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company is repatriating cash in instances where the company can remit to the us without incurring a significant net tax cost  as well as restricting capital expenditures 
the strong operating cash flow from continuing operations of million and resulting debt reduction of million for the full fiscal year indicate that these actions have also been successful 
the resulting additional borrowing capacity is expected to provide additional financial flexibility for the foreseeable future 
the cost reduction initiatives outlined above that were completed in will deliver a total of million in annualized savings 
approximately million of this total savings was realized in and the remaining million will be realized in because of the diversity of the company s businesses  end user markets and geographic locations  management does not use specific external indices to predict the future performance of the company  other than general information about broad macroeconomic trends 
each of our individual business units serves niche markets and attempts to identify trends other than general business and economic conditions which are specific to their businesses and which could impact their performance 
those units report any such information to senior management  which uses it to the extent relevant to assess the future performance of the company 
a description of any such material trends is described below in the applicable segment analysis 
we monitor a number of key performance indicators including net sales  income from operations  backlog and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these key performance indicators is included within the discussion below 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin restructuring expense income from operations backlog net sales net sales  as reported components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales decline growth net sales decreased million in  a decrease from the prior year 
organic sales decreased million or  with the remaining difference due to exchange rates 
while we experienced a recession driven decrease in sales across all segments except for the engineering technologies group  sales in our adp and electronics and hydraulics segments had the most significant declines  as downturns in the housing  white goods  and heavy truck industries impacted the sales of these segments 
net sales increased million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
the net sales increase was positively impacted by the full year impact of our acquisitions and favorable exchange rates 
organic sales grew million or 
sales in our adp and electronics and hydraulics products segments experienced declines  as downturns in the housing and heavy truck industries impacted the sales of these segments 
discussion of the performance of all our segments is more fully detailed below 
gross profit margin our gross profit margin increased in to from in this increase in margin is due to our efforts to reduce our cost structure  as reductions in materials and value added costs were able to outpace the natural inefficiencies resulting from our decrease in sales 
we believe that our cost reduction efforts will better position our operations for higher gross margins when a macroeconomic recovery occurs 
our gross profit margin increased in fiscal to from in restructuring on july   the company announced the closure of the adp production facility located in bartonville  illinois 
the company s decision to close the bartonville facility was in response to the company s lean initiatives  excess capacity  and the continuing decline in the new residential construction market 
the sales and production activities at the bartonville facility were relocated to other adp facilities 
standex recorded a million pre tax expense related to the closure of the bartonville facility during in the second quarter of  the company closed the bessemer  alabama  manufacturing and distribution facility of its hydraulics unit within the electronics and hydraulics group 
production from this plant was consolidated into our other hydraulics operation in ohio 
in january  the company announced the consolidation of three facilities  one each in the food service equipment  engraving  and electronics and hydraulics groups 
production at these locations will be integrated into existing facilities throughout the world in their respective divisions 
related restructuring expenses of million were incurred during the year for these consolidations 
the company has reduced its us based employment by across all divisions in order to reduce costs in response to the macroeconomic recessionary environment and its expected effects on the company in the immediate future 
the company recorded million of pre tax restructuring expense related to this initiative during income from operations income from operations during decreased million  or when compared to this includes the impact of million of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the year  as well as restructuring costs of million during the year 
absent these costs  income from operations decreased million  or  from  which is attributable to the year over year decline in sales offset by the aforementioned improvements in our cost structure 
income from operations during increased million  or when compared to excluding the impact of acquisitions  the increase was million or 
this increase is due to several factors including cost reductions and improvements in productivity at a number of the company s divisions  profit leverage resulting from a organic sales growth  and reduced us pension plan expense due to the freezing of the salaried defined benefit plan 
discussion of the performance of all of our groups is more fully explained in the segment analysis that follows 
income taxes the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million  or an effective rate of  compared to million  or an effective rate of  for the fiscal year ended june  and million  or an effective rate of  for the fiscal year ended june  changes in the effective tax rates from period to period may be significant as they depend on many factors including  but not limited to  size of the company s income or loss and any one time activities occurring during the period 
the company s income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was significantly impacted by the following items i a benefit of million from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable limitation statutes  ii the million impairment for which only of tax benefit could be realized  as the goodwill had no tax basis  iii a benefit totaling million from the reversal of the deferred tax liability that was no longer required due to a change in the us tax classification of one of our foreign entities  iv a benefit of million related primarily to the retroactive extension of the r d credit recorded during the second quarter and v a benefit related to the receipt of million of nontaxable life insurance proceeds during the first quarter 
capital expenditures in general  our capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be approximately equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
in  capital expenditures of million were below our annual depreciation of million and reflect our strategy of cash conservation and debt reduction in response to the current recessionary environment 
in  our capital expenditures were million 
backlog backlog at june  decreased million to million when compared to fiscal  a decrease when compared to prior year 
this decrease is correspondent with our decrease in sales volume as a result of the broader economic climate  and is across all segments  with the exception of a slight increase for the engraving group 
segment analysis net sales the following table presents net sales by business segment in thousands food service equipment air distribution products engraving engineering technologies electronics and hydraulics food service equipment net sales in decreased million  or  from the effects of foreign exchange rates accounted for million of the decline 
when removing the effect of foreign exchange rate impact  sales decreased million  or  when compared with the same period one year earlier 
we achieved slight organic growth in our refrigerated solutions businesses walk in cooler and refrigerated cabinets generally due to market share gains and nominal price increases 
our cooking solutions and custom solutions businesses experienced sales declines primarily due to the market deterioration that began in the second fiscal quarter 
fiscal net sales in the food service equipment group fseg increased million when compared to fiscal  a increase to million 
acquisitions accounted for million of the sales increase 
the acquisition growth was due to the full year impact of the associated american industries aai and american food service acquisitions completed in favorable exchange rate gains accounted for approximately million of the segment s sales increase 
organic sales growth of million accounted for the remainder of the growth 
all fseg major brands experienced positive organic growth through a combination of market share gains  price increases  moderate growth of core markets  broadening our customer base and expanding into new markets 
air distribution products net sales for  declined million  or from the prior year 
standex evaluates the available market for adp by monitoring new housing start data  published monthly by the us department of housing and urban development 
sales to the group s customers typically lag new home starts by three to four months 
a volume decline of was driven by a similar decline in housing starts of during the year 
adp continues to pursue market share gains through its traditional wholesaler channels by expanding its sales force  focusing on underpenetrated markets  and by adding new  adjacent product offerings  such as flex duct 
these initiatives have resulted in market share gains  however  the sales volume increases resulting from these gains are marginal compared to overall market deterioration 
adp s fiscal sales declined million from fiscal levels  a reduction 
the decrease in adp s volume was due to the continuing  significant decline in new residential construction offset partially by market share gains 
during fiscal the housing starts deteriorated by over while during the same period adp s sales  adjusted for price changes  were lower by 
engraving sales in the engraving group decreased by million  or from fiscal levels 
the largest industry served by the mold texturization business  a significant part of the group  is the automotive industry 
sales in this industry are driven by the number of new and redesigned platforms that the oem s introduce during the year 
the group experienced a widespread decrease in sales of mold texturizing for automotive oem platform work in most geographic regions  especially europe  in due to oem s launching fewer new auto platforms and delaying current programs 
lower mold texturing sales were partially offset by stronger sales in core forming tools and filtration screens related to our innovent business 
north american operations sales declined and international operations sales declined 
although this has been a challenging year  we believe that our global presence  as well as our ability to be very respo nsive to our automotive oem customers needs will continue to allow us to leverage our customers desire to work with one company worldwide while meeting their requirements for design and production consistency 
during  sales in the engraving group increased by million  or  from the fiscal level 
sales growth was driven primarily in mold texturization 
these results were partially offset by weakness in the roll  plate and machinery business which was negatively impacted by slowdowns in the automotive and housing markets 
net sales increased by million when compared to fiscal after excluding the effects of foreign exchange which added million 
during fiscal  sales to the automotive industry experienced an increase due to market share gains  strong demand from our automotive oem customers in north american and europe  growth in our china operations as well as very solid performance in our european businesses 
engineering technologies sales increased million in fiscal when compared to the prior year 
our metal spinning and fabrication businesses  which serve customers in the energy  marine  aviation  missile and aerospace industries  experienced steady performance 
we secured new contracts for tank systems for the growing unmanned aerial vehicles market and contracts for tooling and hardware related to nasa s orion and ares rocket programs 
in addition this group saw an increase in demand for land based turbine components 
sales in this group increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
the energy  aerospace  and aviation industries increasingly sourced fabricated metal parts from third parties rather than manufacturing these parts themselves  which benefited our spinning and fabrication businesses 
during  one of our metal spinning businesses recognized million of revenue on a contract for tooling and hardware related to nasa s orion rocket program 
electronics and hydraulics sales declined by million  or in when compared to the same period one year earlier 
for the electronics unit  the decline is attributable to the global recession in the automotive  white goods and hvac market segments  which experienced steep declines during the second half of fiscal within the hydraulics unit  the global decline in new orders for dump trucks and dump trailers has been dramatic  as the recession has resulted in a general lack of credit availability for buyers  as well as an excess of used and repossessed equipment flooding the market 
many difficult yet necessary steps have been undertaken to re position the group  including significant layoffs and plant closings in both units  and the group is focusing on new products and non traditional applications for our products as a means to achieve organic growth 
sales declined by million  or in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
relatively flat year over year sales at our electronics business were attributable to weakness in the automotive  security  hvac and white goods markets  offset by new business in the medical and controls markets 
in the hydraulics unit  declines in the us market were driven by several factors  including new epa regulations  dramatic increases in the price of fuel  and the general slowdown in the construction sector 
income from operations the following table presents income from operations by business segment in thousands food service equipment air distribution products engraving engineering technologies electronics and hydraulics restructuring other income  net corporate food service equipment income from operations our measure of segment profit performance for fiscal decreased approximately million  or  when compared to the same period one year earlier 
excluding the effect of a million impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the third quarter  operating income was approximately flat year over year 
an decline in sales volume was offset by staffing reductions  material and labor productivity improvements  and nominal price increases 
these savings initiatives were partially offset by commodity cost increases in the first half and negative sales mix in the first quarter 
income from operations increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a increase 
the full year impact of acquisitions completed in fiscal added approximately million in income from operations during fiscal excluding the impact of acquisitions  income from operations increased million  or  compared to fiscal our master bilt and nor lake divisions experienced operating income growth in excess of driven by organic sales growth  price increases  cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies in all manufacturing locations 
our procon pump business experienced a improvement in operating income due to organic sales growth  exchange gains  material cost reduction programs and operational improvements in their mexico and ireland operations 
air distribution products operating income for was million  an increase of million from price increases implemented in early partially offset raw steel price increases and declining sales volume 
these raw material price increase were also offset by significant year over year cost savings achieved from the shutdown of the bartonville  illinois  facility in july and salaried and hourly workforce reductions which took place primarily in the third quarter of the year 
additionally  the group recorded expenses of million during the third quarter of to write down inventory of higher cost metal purchased in the first half the year to its fair market value 
fiscal income from operations decreased million from prior year 
the decrease is due primarily to sales volume declines and to a lesser extent  material cost increases 
metal costs escalated more than during the period 
specific raw material cost reduction strategies along with third and fourth quarter price increases helped to partially offset these cost escalations 
engraving income from operations decreased by million  or  to million when compared to fiscal restructuring measures taken during the year consist of the completion of the closure of our ohio mold texturizing and new jersey roll embossing facilities begun in  and an additional consolidation during the year of our michigan mold texturizing facility 
in addition  the group continued to expand the use of lean enterprise techniques throughout its operations in order to further improve profitability and responsiveness to our customers 
income from operations increased by million  or  when compared to fiscal sales volume increases and productivity improvements in the world wide mold texturizing facilities led to significant profit growth in this portion of the engraving group 
in the mold texturizing business we opened a new facility in turkey and a larger facility in the czech republic which contributed to positive earnings growth during the year 
operating income was down year over year in the roll and plate engraving and embossing equipment businesses due primarily to the impact of lower volume resulting from the downturn in the us housing and automotive market  where a large percentage of this unit s products are applied 
engineering technologies income from operations decreased million or in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the reduced profitability was the result of a shift in mix to lower margin products for the energy markets and away from aerospace sales 
the introduction of lean manufacturing techniques as a regular element of daily production is helping to improve margins in this segment 
income from operations increased million  or in fiscal when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the improvement in income from operations was attributed to the growth in aerospace and energy sales coupled with cost reductions 
the improvement in operating income resulting from these efforts was partially offset by production inefficiencies due to the commissioning of new capital equipment and new product launches 
electronics and hydraulics income from operations decreased million in fiscal  or when compared to the same period one year earlier  due primarily to the year over year sales decline of over 
sales demand for this segment was negatively impacted by recessionary market conditions that existed in the automotive  housing white goods and off road construction vehicles end user segments 
in the electronics unit  aggressive cost reduction measures and plant closures resulted in a moderate increase in earnings as a percent of net sales 
in the hydraulics unit  we have successfully introduced new capital equipment to improve productivity and closed one facility 
income from operations decreased million in fiscal  or when compared to the same period one year earlier 
while income from operations was positively impacted by cost reductions achieved through lean manufacturing techniques and the use of low cost manufacturing in mexico and china  these efforts were offset by labor inefficiencies associated with the closure of a canadian manufacturing facility in the electronics unit during these issues were resolved by the end of the year 
corporate corporate expenses decreased million  or during the reduction in corporate expenses can be attributed to a salaried headcount reduction of over  as well as the suspension of bonuses during the year in response to the recessionary macroeconomic environment 
also  in  there was no expense for current year awards under the company s performance based long term stock compensation program  as we determined that the achievement of the performance criteria for outstanding awards was not probable  whereas in these awards resulted in expense of million 
corporate expenses increased million  or  during this increase is primarily due to increased stock based compensation expense as compared to during the accruals made for performance based grants issued between and were reversed when we determined that the achievement of the performance criteria for outstanding awards was not probable 
the net effect of reversing these accruals was a million reduction to stock based compensation expense in fiscal in fiscal we recorded approximately million of expense for the long term stock compensation program for grants made in fiscal discontinued operations in  the company sold substantially all the assets of the berean christian stores berean business in an all cash deal resulting in the recognition of a pre tax gain of million 
as the former owner of berean  the company is party under a number of operating leases which were assigned to the purchaser of the business for the remaining initial terms of the leases at the stated lease costs 
the company remained the guarantor of these leases until the expiration of the initial terms 
in the second quarter of  noting berean s deteriorating operating performance and precarious financial position  the company recorded liabilities of million  net of estimated subleases  in anticipation of the impairment of leases remaining under the obligation 
in june  berean filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and  in july  its assets were sold to a third party under section of the code 
the new owner of the berean assets is infusing capital into the business  and we believe the berean bookstores can now be operated successfully as a going concern 
as part of this transaction  the company agreed to provide lease supplement payments to the new owner of the berean assets 
these payments included an upfront payment of million and additional payments totaling million which will be made in equal monthly installments through december the company will remain a guarantor of the leases assumed by the new owner  however  our guarantee has been reduced for locations where the new owner was able to obtain rent concessions 
in addition  the company remains a guarantor of three sites formerly operated by berean

see the notes to our consolidated financials statements for further information regarding this event 
during the second quarter of  the company was able to complete the sale of the under sink food disposals product line of useco  resulting in a gain on the sale of approximately million offset by losses from the other useco operations 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the remaining useco rethermalization systems business could not be sold  and accordingly  shutdown the operations  accelerating the depreciation expense on the remaining manufacturing equipment and ceasing the manufacturing operations 
any inventory remaining was analyzed and  where usable and transferable to our other businesses  was transferred to current operations 
the remaining inventory was previously fully reserved for 
in connection with the shutdown  the company retained the warranty risk for previously sold units 
the company has analyzed those needs and believes that the current recorded balance of million is sufficient to cover future costs to support warranty claims 
in  the company sold substantially all the assets of the standard publishing business in an all cash deal and recognized a pre tax gain of million in this transaction 
during fiscal  the company sold certain land  buildings and improvements related to standard publishing for net proceeds of million in cash

excluding the impact of foreign exchange  the changes in working capital reflect reduced accounts receivable totaling million and a reduction in inventories generating million in additional cash flow  partially offset by a million reduction in accounts payable 
we used million of cash for investing activities during  including million for capital expenditures 
we also used million for acquisitions  consisting of a small acquisition within the electronics and hydraulics group and the purchase of the richmond  virginia  engraving group facility triggered by the fulfillment of a contingent purchase requirement from the acquisition of ir international 
these cash outflows were offset by life insurance proceeds of million resulting from the death of a former executive and the penalty free withdrawal of excess funding from our policies 
during the year ended june   we used million of cash for financing activities 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that it would be advantageous to retire its remaining fixed rate debt ahead of schedule 
based on this determination  the company used its operating cash flow to repay the debt early 
the additional premium paid and write off of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with this extinguishment were not material 
we paid dividends of million and made net repayments of debt of million including early extinguishment premium during the period 
borrowings and repayments of debt during the period also reflect payments in the second quarter related to the maturity of the company s fixed rate borrowings of million our customer base in the food service equipment  automotive  u 
s 
residential housing and general industrial sectors have all experienced difficult recessionary market conditions 
these recessionary trends have led to a reduction in our sales volume 
to offset the impact of the reduced sales volume  management has implemented a number of cost reduction and cash management initiatives as described above that will save the company in excess of million annually 
in addition  we have reduced our level of capital expenditures and emphasized working capital management 
we reduced working capital by million year over year 
inventory was reduced by million 
we were able to reduce the company s overall raw materials on hand by million year over year  excluding adp s raw material 
note that adp generally has a higher concentration of raw materials than the rest of the com pany due to the nature of the business ie manufacturing process and short lead times to our customers 
capital structure we have in place a five year  million unsecured revolving credit facility the facility with seven participating banks which originated in september the company also has an optional million accordion feature under the facility 
funds available under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes or to provide financing for acquisitions 
borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement

we are required to pay an annual fee of on the maximum credit line 
the company has undertaken a series of initiatives to generate cash and reduce debt  including cost reductions  improved working capital management  repatriation of foreign cash  and plant consolidations 
these initiatives have enabled us to pay down substantially all of our private placement debt 
as of june   we had borrowings of million under the facility 
we believe that the remaining million available provides us with sufficient capacity to meet both our short and long term liquidity needs 
our funded debt agreements contain certain customary affirmative and negative covenants  as well as specific financial covenants 
the company s current financial covenants under the facility are as follows interest coverage ratio the company is required to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes ebit to interest expense for the trailing twelve months of at least ebit is defined in the revolving credit facility to specifically exclude extraordinary and other non recurring items such as non cash restructuring charges and goodwill impairment 
at june   the company s interest coverage ratio was leverage ratio the company s ratio of funded debt to trailing twelve month ebitda  defined as ebit plus depreciation and amortization  may not exceed at june   the company s leverage ratio was consolidated net worth the company is required to maintain a consolidated net worth of at least million plus of cumulative net income since the inception of the agreement 
consolidated net worth is defined as the company s net worth as adjusted for unfunded pension liabilities not to exceed million and certain foreign exchange gains and losses

no amounts were outstanding under these facilities at june  and at june   and  we had standby letters of credit outstanding  primarily for insurance purposes  of million and million  respectively our primary cash requirements in addition to day to day operating needs include interest and mandatory principal payments  capital expenditures  and dividends 
our primary sources of cash for these requirements are cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the facility 
we expect to spend between million on capital expenditures during  and expect that depreciation and amortization expense for the year will be approximately million and million  respectively 
in july  we entered into a series of swap agreements with one and two year terms effectively converting interest payments on our long term debt from variable to fixed rates 
we converted interest payments on million of debt due under the facility from variable rates based on libor to a weighted average effective rate of based on our current leverage ratio 
the one year swaps totaling million expired in july the two years swaps totaling million will expire in july the following table sets forth our capitalization at june year ended june in thousands short term debt long term debt total debt less cash total net debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity decreased year over year primarily as a result of the net loss of million  which was driven by non cash impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of million  dividends of million  unfavorable foreign currency movements of million and pension losses of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to the treasury stock activity offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock option exercises and stock based compensation in the current year 
the company s net debt to capital percentage increased from to in due to a net loss coupled with the aforementioned other comprehensive losses in currency and pension 
we sponsor a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans 
the company s pension plan for us salaried employees was frozen as of january all participants in the us salaried pension plan and the supplemental defined benefit plan no longer accrue future benefits

this suspension began in april and will continue until at least the end of calendar year we have evaluated the current and long term cash requirements of our defined benefit and defined contribution plans as of june  our operating cash flows from continuing operations and available liquidity are expected to be sufficient to cover required contributions under erisa and other governing regulations 
we have an insurance program for certain retired key executives 
the underlying policies have a cash surrender value of million and are reported net of loans of million for which we have the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits 
the aggregate present value of future obligations was million and million at june  and  respectively 
during  the company withdrew million of excess funding from these policies with no related tax consequences and received million of cash proceeds upon the death of a former executive covered by this program 
contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long and short term debt obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest payments post retirement benefit payments purchase obligations other total estimated interest payments are based upon effective interest rates as of june   and includes the impact of interest rate swaps 
see item a for further discussions surrounding interest rate exposure on our variable rate borrowings 
post retirement benefit payments are based upon current benefit payment levels plus estimated health care costs trends of in the first year trending to through fiscal lease supplement payments to berean christian stores endeavor  llc at june   we had million of non current liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future payments related to these obligations 
off balance sheet items in connection with the sale of the berean christian bookstores completed in august  we assigned all but one lease to the buyers 
during june  the berean business filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the berean assets were subsequently resold under section of the code 
the new owners of the berean business have negotiated lower lease rates and extended lease terms at certain of the leased locations

the aggregate amount of these guarantees is million at june  we had no other material off balance sheet items at june   other than the operating leases and purchase obligations summarized above 
other matters inflation certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
we monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us 
foreign currency translation our primary functional currencies used by our non us subsidiaries are the euro  british pound sterling pound  mexican peso  and chinese yuan 
during the current year  the pound sterling  euro  and peso have experienced decreases in value relative to the us dollar  our reporting currency

we renegotiated four union contracts during  and in each case reached an agreement 
a total of two collective bargaining contracts covering approximately employees will expire in the company maintains good working relations with all of its unions  however  there can be no guarantee that agreements can be reached in future negotiations 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all of our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
collectability of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and potentially obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount of the asset 
the company s annual test for impairment is performed using a may st measurement date 
we have identified our reporting units for impairment testing as our twelve operating segments  which are aggregated into our five reporting segments as disclosed in note industry segment information 
the test for impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed  wherein the reporting unit s carrying value is compared to the implied fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  impairment exists and must be recognized 
as quoted market prices are not available for the company s reporting units  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using one or both of a discounted cash flow model income approach  and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues market approach where comparable data exists for those reporting units 
both methods use various assumptions that are specific to each individual reporting unit in order to determine the fair value 
in addition  the company compares the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to its overall market capitalization 
due to the continued deterioration in the us equity and credit markets and industry wide declines in profitability  the company s market capitalization decreased below its book value during the third quarter of after taking into consideration these triggering events  the company concluded that an interim assessment was required and measured goodwill for impairment as of march  our interim impairment testing at each reporting unit relied on assumptions surrounding general market conditions  short term growth rates  a terminal growth rate of  and management forecasts of future cash flows 
we also considered historical results including sales growth  operating profits  working capital levels  and tax rates 
fair values are determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at an estimated cost of capital 
we selected a weighted average cost of capital of percent for three of our reporting units  perce nt for one of our other reporting units  and percent for our remaining units 
estimated future cash flows are based on a detailed cash flow forecast prepared by the relevant reporting unit 
we used standard valuation practices to arrive at a weighted average cost of capital based on market inputs  including treasury bond yields  equity risk premiums  and company specific risk premiums 
changes in discounted cash flow are inversely proportional to changes in the discount rate 
an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points in the analysis of the standex electronics reporting unit would result in impairment of a portion of its goodwill 
we also noted that an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points on other reporting units would not result in the identification of any impairments 
the company completed step of the impairment test and determined that the carrying value of the associated american industries aai reporting unit within the food service equipment group exceeded its fair value 
based on the allocation of the unit s fair value in accordance with step  it was determined that goodwill and trademarks at aai were impaired 
as a result  the company determined that the fair value of the goodwill at aai was approximately million compared to a carrying value of million resulting in a million impairment 
in addition  we assessed our intangible assets for impairment 
based upon those assessments  we determined the fair value of a non amortizing intangible asset included in the aai reporting unit was impaired  and recognized a million impairment related to the carrying value of aai s trademarks 
the company updated its assessment of goodwill impairment as of its annual measurement date of may  our annual impairment testing at each reporting unit relied on assumptions similar to those that existed at march based on changes to the company s projected risk premiums and general market conditions  including changes in risk free rates and our specific company rate  between march and may  we selected a weighted average cost of capital of percent for three of our reporting units  percent for one of our other reporting units  and percent for our remaining units 
an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points in the analysis of the standex electronics reporting unit would result in impairment of a portion of its goodwill 
we also noted that an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points on other reporting units would not result in the identification of any impairments 
no additional impairments were recorded as a result of this update 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  changes in assumptions could significantly affect our valuations and result in impairments in the future 
the most significant assumption involved in the company s determination of fair value is the cash flow projections of each reporting unit 
certain of our reporting units have been significantly influenced by the current global economic downturn  including adp and standex electronics  which had goodwill of million and million  respectively  as of the measurement date 
adp has been significantly impacted by the declines in new housing starts and other factors impacting residential housing 
standex electronics has been affected by the impacts on capital equipment makers and to a lesser extent the automotive industry 
for each of these reporting units  management has projected that the operating results will continue to be unfavorably impacted in fis cal but will gradually begin to return to historic levels of profitability in the years to if the effects of the current global economic environment are protracted or the recovery is slower than we have projected estimates of future cash flows for each reporting unit may be insufficient to support the carrying value of the reporting units  requiring the company to re assess its conclusions related to fair value and the recoverability of goodwill 
cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some postretirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of in the us is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
the us discount rate of reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions  including discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a twenty five basis point change in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million per year 
a twenty five basis point basis point change in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million annually 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the keysop plan and non qualified defined contribution plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  we have no interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk we are exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
the transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service on intercompany accounts 
we also mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
the contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend and loan payments  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
at june  and  the fair value of the company s open foreign exchange contracts were not material 
our primary translation risk is with the euro  british pound sterling  and chinese yuan 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of any these foreign currencies to the us dollar at june   would not result in a material change in our operations  financial position  or cash flows 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate the company s effective rate on variable rate borrowings under the revolving credit agreement increased from at june  to at june  our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  we will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
in july  we entered into a series of swap agreements with one and two year terms effectively converting interest payments on million of debt due under our revolving credit agreement from variable rates based on libor to a fixed rate of based on the company s leverage ratio at june  due to the impact of the swaps  an increase in interest rates would not materially impact our annual interest expense at june  concentration of credit risk we have a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for all commodities used in its manufacturing processes 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
while standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good  there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage 
the adp  engineering technologies  food service equipment and electronics and hydraulics groups are all sensitive to price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
in the past year  we have experienced price fluctuations for a number of materials including steel  copper wire  other metal commodities  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these materials are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
wherever possible  we will implement price increases to offset the impact of changing prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  if implemented  will be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
