critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting estimates are particularly important to the understanding of the company s financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the company s management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside the control of management 
the company s management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on historical operations  future business plans and projected financial results  the terms of existing contracts  the observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the following discusses the company s critical accounting policies and estimates 
estimates 
operating results may be affected by certain accounting estimates 
the most sensitive and significant accounting estimates in the financial statements relate to customer rebates  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  obsolete and slow moving inventories  potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  and accruals for income taxes 
although the company s management has used available information to make judgments on the appropriate estimates to account for the above matters  there can be no assurance that future events will not significantly affect the estimated amounts related to these areas where estimates are required 
however  historically  actual results have not been materially different than original estimates 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from sales of its products when ownership transfers to the customers  which occurs either at the time of shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms with the customer 
when the right of return exists  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with fasb statement no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the company recognizes customer program costs  including rebates  cooperative advertising  slotting fees and other sales related discounts  as a reduction to sales in accordance with eitf allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of outstanding accounts receivable  historical collection information and existing economic conditions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents estimated uncollectible accounts receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations  usually due to potential insolvencies 
the allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified 
in addition  the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults based on historical experience 
the company actively monitors its accounts receivable balances and its historical experience of annual accounts receivable write offs has been negligible 
customer rebates 
customer rebates and incentives are a common practice in the office products industry 
we incur customer rebate costs to obtain favorable product placement  to promote sell through of products and to maintain competitive pricing 
customer rebate costs and incentives  including volume rebates  promotional funds  catalog allowances and slotting fees  are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales 
these costs are recorded at the time of sale and are based on individual customer contracts 
management periodically reviews accruals for these rebates and allowances  and adjusts accruals when appropriate 
obsolete and slow moving inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out method  or market 
a reserve is established to adjust the cost of inventory to its net realizable value 
inventory reserves are recorded for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products  the impact of new product introductions and specific identification of items  such as discontinued products 
these estimates could vary significantly from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from expectations 
income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are recorded at cost upon acquisition and amortized over the term of the related contract  if any  or useful life  as applicable 
intangible assets held by the company with finite useful lives include patents and trademarks 
patents and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful life 
the weighted average amortization period for intangible assets at december  was years 
the company periodically reviews the values recorded for intangible assets to assess recoverability from future operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during  the net book value of the company s intangible assets increased to  as of december   from  as of december  accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r 
share based payments sfas r 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which involves certain subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term volatility and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stock based compensation  and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
refer to note stock option plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for a more detailed discussion of the effects of sfas r on the company s results of operations and financial condition
