overview we are a leading provider of automation  vacuum and instrumentation solutions and are a highly valued business partner to original equipment manufacturers oem and equipment users throughout the world 
we serve markets where equipment productivity and availability is a critical factor for our customers success 
our largest served market is the semiconductor manufacturing industry  which represented of our consolidated revenues for fiscal year we also provide unique solutions to customers in data storage  advanced display  analytical instruments and solar markets 
we develop and deliver differentiated solutions that range from proprietary products to highly respected manufacturing services 
the demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical  resulting in periodic expansions and contractions 
demand for our products has been impacted by these cyclical industry conditions 
during fiscal year and throughout most of fiscal year  we benefited from an industry expansion 
that cyclical expansion turned to a downturn in the fourth quarter of fiscal year that continued through the second quarter of fiscal year the decline was particularly pronounced in the first two quarters of fiscal year with a sharp contraction of capital spending in all of our served markets as well as reduced demand by oems as a result of inventory corrections 
throughout the second half of fiscal year  demand for our products began to improve 
our revenues for our third quarter of fiscal year increased from the second quarter of fiscal year  and our revenues for our fourth quarter of fiscal increased from the third quarter of fiscal year throughout fiscal years and  we have implemented a number of cost reduction programs to align our cost structure with a reduced demand environment 
since the end of fiscal year  we have reduced our headcount by approximately and closed redundant facilities 
in connection with our restructuring programs  we have realigned our management structure and our underlying internal financial reporting structure 
effective as of the beginning of our second quarter of  we implemented a new internal reporting structure which includes three segments critical solutions group  systems solutions group and global customer operations 
the critical solutions group segment provides a variety of products critical to technology equipment productivity and availability 
those products include robots and robotic modules for atmospheric and vacuum applications and cryogenic vacuum pumping  thermal management and vacuum measurement solutions used to create  measure and control critical process vacuum applications 
the systems solutions group segment provides a range of products and engineering and manufacturing services  which include our extended factory services  that enable our customers to effectively develop and source high quality  high reliability  process tools for semiconductor and adjacent market applications 
the global customer operations segment provides an extensive range of support services including on and off site repair services  on and off site diagnostic support services  and installation services to enable our customers to maximize process tool uptime and productivity 
this segment also provides services and spare parts for our automated material handling systems amhs product line 
revenues from the sales of spare parts that are not related to a repair or replacement transaction  or are not amhs products  are included within the product revenues of the other operating segments 

table of contents as a result of our acquisitions  we have identified intangible assets and generated significant goodwill 
intangible assets are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
intangible assets and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of our fiscal year end  or september th 
our annual goodwill impairment test as of september  indicated no impairment to our goodwill 
market conditions changed dramatically near the end of fiscal as a result of the global economic downturn 
these market changes reduced the fair value of our reporting units  which ultimately resulted in a million impairment to our goodwill as of september  our significant restructuring actions implemented during the first half of fiscal changed our internal management structure and our internal financial reporting structures  which further led to a change to our reporting units and operating segments as of march  we are required to reallocate goodwill among these newly formed reporting units 
this reallocation  in conjunction with the continued downturn in the semiconductor markets indicated that a potential impairment did exist at march  as such  we tested goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment at march  and recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million 
the details of these goodwill impairment charges are discussed further under the impairment charges caption 
our test of goodwill as of september  indicated that we did not have any further impairment to goodwill 
under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  we are required to test long lived assets  which exclude goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized  when indicators of impairment are present 
we recorded an impairment charges for certain long lived assets of million as of september   and we recorded an additional long lived asset impairment charge of million as of march  these impairment charges were related to the same declining market conditions that resulted in impairments to our goodwill 
we recorded an additional impairment charge of million for certain long lived assets as of june   which relates to the closure and outsourcing of a small manufacturing operation located in the united states 
we discuss these charges in further detail under the impairment charges caption 
on march   we completed the sale of our software division  brooks software  to applied materials  inc applied for cash consideration and the assumption of certain liabilities related to brooks software 
brooks software provided real time applications for greater efficiency and productivity in collaborative  complex manufacturing environments 
we transferred to applied substantially all of our assets primarily related to brooks software  including the stock of several subsidiaries engaged only in the business of brooks software  and applied assumed certain liabilities related to brooks software 
we sold our software division in order to focus on our core semiconductor related hardware businesses 
we recognized a gain on disposal of the software division 
our consolidated financial statements and notes have been reclassified to reflect this business as a discontinued operation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed in the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenues product revenues are associated with the sale of hardware systems  components and spare parts as well as product license revenue 
service revenues are associated with service contracts  repairs  upgrades and field service 
shipping and handling fees  if any  billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
revenue from product sales that do not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
in the limited situations where the arrangement contains extended payment terms  revenue is recognized as the payments become due 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue associated with service agreements is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from repair services or upgrades of customer owned equipment is recognized upon completion of the repair effort and upon the shipment of the repaired item back to the customer 
in instances where the repair or upgrade includes installation  revenue is recognized when the installation is completed 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets as a result of our acquisitions  we have identified general intangible assets other than goodwill and generated significant goodwill 
general intangible assets other than goodwill are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
general intangible assets other than goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of our fiscal year end  or september th 
under us gaap  the testing of goodwill for impairment is to be performed at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
a reporting unit is either the operating segment level or one level below  which is referred to as a component 
the level at which the impairment test is performed requires an assessment as to whether the operations below the operating segment constitute a self sustaining business  testing is generally required to be performed at this level  however  if multiple self sustaining business units exist within an operating segment  an evaluation would be performed to determine if the multiple business units share resources that support the overall goodwill balance 
in response to the global economic downturn  we have restructured our business  which has resulted in a change to our reporting units and operating segments 
the recent changes to our internal reporting structure and to how we operate our business resulted in the identification of seven reporting units  which include components of our business that are one level below the operating segment level 
as of march   we re allocated our goodwill to five of the seven newly identified reporting units principally based on the relative fair values of these reporting units 
this reallocation  in conjunction with the continued downturn in the semiconductor markets indicated that a potential impairment may have existed at march  as such  we tested goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment at march  we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow method dcf method 
the dcf method includes five year future cash flow projections  which are discounted to present value  and an estimate of terminal values  which are also discounted to present value 
terminal values represent the present value an investor would pay today for the rights to the cash flows of the business for the years subsequent to the discrete cash flow projection period 
given the cyclical nature of the industry  a revenue multiple is used to determine terminal value as it represents a more stable multiple over time 
we consider the dcf method to be the most appropriate valuation indicator as the dcf analyses are based on management s long term financial projections 
given the dynamic nature of the cyclical 
table of contents semiconductor equipment market  management s projections as of the valuation date are considered more objective since other market metrics for peer companies fluctuate over the cycle 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be completed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  the excess of the fair value over amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and million in the three month periods ended september  and march   respectively 
the details of these goodwill impairment charges are discussed further under the impairment charges caption 
our test of goodwill as of september  indicated that we did not have any further impairment to goodwill 
under us gaap  we are required to test long lived assets  which exclude goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized  when indicators of impairment are present 
for purposes of this test  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when we determine that indicators of potential impairment exist  the next step of the impairment test requires that the potentially impaired long lived asset group is tested for recoverability 
the test for recoverability compares the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset group to its carrying value 
the future cash flow period is based on the future service life of the primary asset within the long lived asset group 
in most cases  we have determined that either customer based or technology based intangible assets are the primary asset of each long lived asset group 
if the future cash flows exceed the carrying values of the long lived assets  the assets are considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying values of the long lived asset group exceed the future cash flows  the assets are considered to be potentially impaired 
the next step in the impairment process is to determine the fair value of the individual net assets within the long lived asset group 
if the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group exceed their carrying values  then no impairment loss is recorded 
if the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group are less then their carrying values  an impairment is recorded equal to the excess of the aggregate carrying value of the group over the aggregate fair value 
the loss is allocated to each asset within the group based on their relative carrying values  with no asset reduced below its fair value 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  million and million related to certain long lived assets in the three month periods ended september   march  and june   respectively  which we discuss in further detail under the impairment charges caption 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount 
trade accounts receivables do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience by customer 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is estimated by assessing product failure rates  
table of contents material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management has considered the weight of all available evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance remains to be required against its deferred tax assets at september  given the losses incurred in fiscal year combined with the cyclical nature of our business as well as the uncertainties currently impacting the global economy  we have determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating taxable income in future periods 
we continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all employee stock awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the excess of the quoted price of our common stock over the exercise price of the restricted stock on the date of grant  if any  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
in addition  for stock based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals  we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
restricted stock with market based vesting criteria is valued using a lattice model 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a decrease 
the total decrease in revenues of million impacted all of our operating segments 
our critical solutions group segment revenues decreased by million  our system solutions group segment revenues decreased by million and our global customer operations segment revenues decreased by million 
these decreases were the result of lower volume shipments in response to 
table of contents declining demand for capital equipment in all the markets we serve 
starting in the third quarter of fiscal  we began to experience an increase in demand for our products from our semiconductor capital equipment customers 
our revenues for our third quarter of fiscal increased from the second quarter of fiscal  and our revenues for our fourth quarter of fiscal increased from the third quarter of fiscal we expect our revenues for our first quarter of fiscal to increase at least from the million in revenues recognized for our fourth quarter of fiscal our critical solutions group segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to lower volume of shipments for all end markets served by this segment  including a decrease of million in revenues to the semiconductor end market  a decrease of million in revenues to the industrial end market and a million decrease in revenues to all other end markets served by this segment 
this segment experienced an improvement in revenues of for the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the prior sequential quarter  with the increase attributable primarily to semiconductor end market revenues 
our system solutions group segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to weaker demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
this segment experienced an improvement in revenues of in the third quarter of fiscal as compared to the prior sequential quarter  and an additional improvement in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior sequential quarter 
our global customer operations segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to lower amhs spare parts revenue of million and lower service contract and repair revenues of million 
all service revenues  which include service contract and repair services  are related to our global customer operations segment 
this segment experienced an improvement in revenues of in the fourth quarter of as compared to the prior sequential quarter 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
gross margin gross margin dollars decreased to a loss of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million for the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to lower revenues of million  an impairment of long lived assets of million and increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
these decreases were partially offset by million of reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets  due primarily to the impairment recorded for those assets during the second quarter of fiscal gross margin was reduced by million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  for amortization of completed technology  which relates primarily to the acquisition of helix technology corporation in october gross margin percentage decreased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to the impairment of long lived assets which reduced gross margin percentage by  increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory which decreased gross margin percentage by  with the balance of the decrease related primarily to the lower absorption of indirect factory overhead on lower revenues 
gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of fiscal was as compared to for the prior sequential quarter 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues of million 
these higher revenues increased our gross margin dollars by million  or approximately 
we expect our gross margin percentage to further increase in the first quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to higher revenues  which lead to improved absorption of indirect factory overhead costs 
gross margin of our critical solutions group segment decreased to million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million in the prior year 
this decrease was attributable to lower revenues of million  which was partially offset by million of reduced amortization expense for completed 
table of contents technology intangible assets  due primarily to the impairment recorded for those assets during the second quarter of fiscal gross margin for fiscal and was reduced by million and million  respectively  for completed technology amortization related to the helix acquisition 
gross margin percentage was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily the result of lower absorption of indirect factory overhead on lower revenues 
gross margin percentage for this segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal was as compared to for the prior sequential quarter

these decreases were partially offset by million of reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets  due primarily to the impairment recorded for those assets during the second quarter of gross margin for fiscal and fiscal was reduced by million and million  respectively  for completed technology amortization related to the helix acquisition 
gross margin percentage was for fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was attributable to increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory which decreased gross margin percentage by  with the balance of the decrease related primarily to an under utilization of our service infrastructure 
gross margin for fiscal year has been reduced by million for the impairment of certain long lived assets  including a million charge for completed technology intangible assets and million charge for property and equipment 
the details of our impairment charges are discussed in greater detail under the impairment charges caption 
research and development research and development  or r d  expenses for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease is primarily related to lower labor related costs of million associated with headcount reductions 
our headcount reductions were implemented to remove redundancies in our r d infrastructure 
we will continue to invest in r d projects that enhance our product and service offerings 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower labor costs of million as we reduced our headcount to align our sg a resources with our new management structure  a million reduction in amortization of intangible assets primarily due to the impairment of intangible assets recorded in our second quarter of fiscal year and a million reduction in legal  auditing and consulting fees 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in litigation costs  net of insurance reimbursements  incurred by us to indemnify a former executive 
we settled our litigation matters with the sec during fiscal  however  we continue to incur litigation costs  net of 
table of contents insurance reimbursements  relating to our former executive officer that we are contractually required to indemnify 
the total indemnification costs  net of insurance reimbursements  were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the indemnification costs incurred in fiscal were incurred primarily during the first half of the fiscal year 
impairment charges we test our goodwill for impairment as of each fiscal year end 
our goodwill test as of september  indicated that our goodwill was potentially impaired  and after completing our analysis  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
in addition to the goodwill impairment charge  we recognized a long lived asset impairment charge of million 
the impairment charges were the result of our expectation that our future cash flows would be adversely impacted as a result of the global economic slowdown 
in response to this downturn  we have restructured our business  which has resulted in a change to our reporting units and operating segments 
we reallocated goodwill to each of our newly formed reporting units as of march   based on such factors as the relative fair values of each reporting unit 
we reallocated goodwill to five of our seven reporting units as of march  this reallocation  in conjunction with the continued downturn in the semiconductor markets indicated that a potential impairment may exist 
as such  we tested our goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment at march  we determined the fair value of each reporting unit as of march  using the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow method dcf method 
the methodologies used to determine the fair value of the net assets of each reporting unit as of march  did not change from those used as of september   or those used as of september  the material assumptions used in the dcf method include discount rates and revenue forecasts 
discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital wacc  which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital 
the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies 
the average wacc used in the march  reallocation of goodwill was  as compared to for the goodwill test as of september  this increase was primarily the result of significantly increased costs of equity capital driven by increased volatility in equity markets 
management determines revenue forecasts based on its best estimate of near term revenue expectations which are corroborated by communications with customers  and longer term projection trends  which are validated by published independent industry analyst reports 
revenue forecasts materially impact the amount of cash flow generated during the five year discrete cash flow period  and also impact the terminal value as that value is derived from projected revenue 
the revenue forecasts used in the reallocation and assessment of goodwill as of march  were decreased from the levels forecasted for the goodwill impairment test as of september  due to further market deterioration 
for three of the five reporting units containing goodwill at march   we determined that the carrying amount of their net assets exceeded their respective fair values  indicating that a potential impairment existed for each of those three reporting units 
after completing the required steps of the goodwill impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million as of march  under us gaap  we are required to test certain long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present 
we determined that impairment indicators were present for certain of our long lived assets as of march  we tested the long lived assets in question for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows attributable to each respective asset group to their carrying amounts  and determined that the carrying amounts were not recoverable 
we then evaluated the fair values of each long lived asset of the potentially impaired long lived asset group to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
the fair value of each intangible asset was based primarily on an income approach  which is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by the asset 
we estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of each intangible asset  which ranged from approximately to years  and used a discount rate of approximately 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that we had incurred an impairment loss of million as of march   and we allocated that loss among the long lived assets of the impaired asset group based on the carrying value of each asset  with no asset reduced below its respective fair value 
the impairment charge was allocated as follows million related to completed technology intangible assets  million to trade name intangible assets  million to customer 
table of contents relationship intangible assets and million to property  plant and equipment 
further  during the three months ended june  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million for property  plant and equipment related to the closure and outsourcing of a small manufacturing operation located in the united states 
the total impairment charges related to long lived assets for fiscal are summarized as follows in thousands year ended september  reported as cost of sales completed technology intangible asset impairment property  plant and equipment impairment subtotal  reported as cost of sales reported as operating expense trade name intangible asset impairment customer relationship intangible asset impairment subtotal  reported as operating expense we performed our annual impairment test on goodwill as of september   and determined that we did not have an additional impairment 
as of september   we have million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
the goodwill relates entirely to our critical solutions group segment  more specifically  to two reporting units within this segment 
our other intangible assets include million of intangible assets related to our critical solutions group segment and million related to our global customer operations segment 
given the cyclical nature of our business and the uncertainties currently impacting the global economy  there can be no assurance that our projected revenues used to test goodwill and other intangible assets will prove to be accurate in the future 
if our projected revenues are not achieved  the fair value of our reporting units or other intangible assets may decline 
accordingly  we may be required to record additional goodwill or other intangible asset impairment charges in future periods  whether in conjunction with our next annual impairment testing  or prior to that  if any such change constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter in which our annual impairment test is performed 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result  however  if it does  then such charge could be material 
restructuring charges we recorded charges of million for fiscal year in connection with our fiscal year restructuring plan 
these charges consisted of million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions of approximately employees in operations  service and administrative functions across all the main geographies in which we operate  facility closure costs of million related primarily to the closure of one manufacturing operation located in the united states  and other restructuring costs of million 
the restructuring charges by segment for fiscal were critical solutions group million  systems solutions group million and global customer operations million 
in addition  we incurred million of restructuring charges for fiscal that were related to general corporate functions that support all of our segments 
the accruals for workforce reductions are expected to be paid over the next twelve months 
the annual salary and benefit cost reductions resulting from these actions are approximately million per year  with a majority of these cost reductions resulting in a decrease to our operating expenses  mainly r d and sg a 
although we expect to increase production related headcount in the near term to meet current increases in product demand  we do not expect to materially increase our operating expense infrastructure in the near term 
we recorded a charge to continuing operations of million for fiscal year this charge consists of million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions of employees in operations  
table of contents service and administrative functions across all the main geographies in which we operate 
we also incurred million of costs to vacate excess facilities 
our restructuring charges by segment for fiscal year were global customer operations million  critical solutions group million and systems solutions group million 
in addition  we incurred million of restructuring charges in fiscal year that were related to general corporate functions that support all of our segments 
interest income and expense interest income was million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
approximately million of this decrease is due to lower investment balances  with the balance of the decrease attributable to lower interest rates on our investments 
interest expense remained essentially flat at million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
interest expense relates primarily to discounting of multi year restructuring costs 
loss on investment during fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million to write down our minority equity investment in a closely held swiss public company 
the remaining balance of this investment at september  after giving effect to foreign exchange was million 
during fiscal year  we recorded charges of million to write down our minority equity investment in this closely held swiss public company 
other income expense other income  net of million for fiscal year consists of management fee income of million which has been mostly offset by foreign exchange losses 
other expense  net of million for fiscal year consists of foreign exchange losses of million  which was partially offset by management fees of million  the receipt of million of principal repayments on notes that had been previously written off and other income of million 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million for fiscal year and an income tax provision of million for the prior year 
the tax provision recorded for both periods is principally attributable to foreign income and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  and  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
we adopted the guidance related to uncertain tax positions on october  the implementation of this guidance did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
of the unrecognized tax benefits of million at september   we currently anticipate that approximately million will be paid in settlement during the next twelve months as a result of finalizing certain non us audits 
equity in earnings of joint ventures income associated with our interest in ulvac cryogenics  inc  a joint venture with ulvac corporation of japan  was million for fiscal year  compared to million in the prior year 
the income loss associated with our interest in yaskawa brooks automation  inc  a joint venture with yaskawa electric corporation of japan was million for fiscal year as compared to million in the prior year 

table of contents year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a decrease 
the total decrease in revenues of million impacted all of our operating segments 
our critical solutions group segment revenues decreased by million  our system solutions group segment revenues decreased by million and our global customer operations segment revenues decreased by million 
these decreases were the result of lower volume shipments in response to declining demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
our critical solutions group segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to a one time royalty license of million recorded in the prior year  and lower volume of shipments due to weaker demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased revenue from non semiconductor industry related customers 
our system solutions group segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
this decrease is attributable to weaker demand for semiconductor capital equipment and impacted all product lines within this segment 
our global customer operations segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year

gross margin for both periods included million of completed technology amortization related to the helix acquisition 
gross margin percentage was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year

table of contents research and development research and development expenses for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
while we continued support for high priority projects  we did experience lower spending of million associated with certain critical solutions development cycles coming to completion 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in management incentive costs  a million decrease in legal fees primarily as a result of the settlement of stockholder litigation and a million reduction in stock based compensation expense mainly due to the departure of certain executives 
in connection with our implementation of the oracle erp system  we treat certain internal labor costs as part of the cost to implement this system 
these costs  along with third party consulting fees and software licenses are treated as capital expenditures  and will be depreciated over the useful life of this system 
during fiscal  we increased the amount of labor costs capitalized for our oracle project by million  with an offsetting reduction to our selling  general and administrative expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by million of higher intangible asset amortization 
impairment charges we recorded an impairment charge of million in the year ended september   which included an impairment of our goodwill of million  and an impairment to other intangible assets of million as of september  in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down certain buildings and leasehold improvements to fair value as of september  we test our goodwill for impairment as of each fiscal year end 
our goodwill test as of september  indicated that our goodwill was not impaired 
we experienced a cyclical slowdown in demand during fiscal throughout most of fiscal  external market forecasts indicated that demand would improve in these external market forecasts changed abruptly at the end of fiscal and into early fiscal the downturn experienced in the semiconductor capital equipment market during was further worsened by the global economic slowdown 
this abrupt change in our outlook resulted in an expectation of lower cash flows from all of our reporting units 
we determined the fair value of each reporting unit as of september  using the income approach  specifically the dcf method 
the methodologies used to determine the fair value of the net assets of each reporting unit as of september  did not change from those used as of september  the material assumptions used in the dcf method include discount rates and revenue forecasts 
discount rates are based on a wacc  which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital 
the wacc used to test goodwill was derived from a group of comparable companies 
the average wacc used in the goodwill test was  which changed only slightly from used in the prior period  with the decrease due primarily to declining market interest rates 
we determine revenue forecasts based on our best estimate of near term revenue expectations which are corroborated by communications with customers  and longer term projection trends  which are validated by published independent industry analyst reports 
revenue forecasts materially impact the amount of cash flow generated during the five year projection period  and also impact the terminal value as that value is derived from projected revenue 
the decrease in projected revenue for all reporting units for both the forecast period and the terminal period is the primary cause for the lower fair values of all reporting units in as compared to for all three reporting units containing goodwill at september   we determined that the carrying amount of their net assets exceeded their respective fair values  indicating that a potential impairment existed for each of those reporting units 
after completing the required steps of the goodwill impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million as of september  
table of contents under us gaap  we are required to test certain long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present 
we determined that impairment indicators were present for certain of our long lived assets as of september  we tested the long lived assets in question for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group to the respective carrying amounts  and determined that the carrying amounts were not recoverable 
we then evaluated the fair values of each long lived asset of the potentially impaired long lived asset group to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
after completing this analysis  we recorded an impairment of million for intangible assets and an additional impairment charge of million related to property  plant and equipment

interest income and expense interest income decreased by million  to million  for fiscal year  from million for the prior year

liquidity and capital resources our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and oems that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
demand for semiconductors is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
this cyclicality makes estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows inherently uncertain 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million

our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact

these sources of cash were partially offset by million of capital expenditures  including million in expenditures related to our oracle erp implementation 
we implemented the oracle erp system in most of our us operations in july we will incur additional costs to implement this system in our international locations  however  we do not expect this cost to significantly impact our financial position or cash flow 

table of contents at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities

we adopted the guidance related to uncertain tax positions on october  as of september   the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was million 
although we anticipate that we will settle approximately million of the million within the next twelve months  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate for the remaining million as to when cash settlement  if any  will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolution of those examinations is uncertain 
in connection with our acquisition of helix technology corporation in october  we assumed the responsibility for the helix employees pension plan the plan 
we froze the benefit accruals and future participation in the plan as of october  we currently have a liability of million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at september  related to this plan 
the timing of payments we make for this plan is impacted by a number of estimates including earnings on plan assets and the timing of future

repurchases were commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice

during the year ended september   we purchased  shares of our common stock for a total of million in connection with the stock repurchase plan 
this plan expired on november   and we made no repurchases under this plan during the year ended september  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for both the short and long term 
however  the cyclical nature of our served markets and uncertainty with the current global economic environment makes it difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure as our cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities  which are short term in nature  our exposure to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant 
our short term and long term investments consist mostly of highly rated corporate debt securities  and as such  market risk to these investments is not significant 
during the year ended september   the unrealized gain on marketable securities  excluding our investment in a swiss public company  was million 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual change of approximately million in interest income earned 
currency rate exposure we have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros and a variety of asian currencies 
sales in currencies other than the us dollar were of our total sales for year ended september  these foreign sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries  which have cost structures that align with the currency of sale 
in the normal course of our business  we have short term advances between our legal entities that are subject to foreign currency exposure 
these short term advances were approximately million at september   and relate to the euro and a variety of asian currencies 
a majority of our foreign currency loss of million for fiscal year relates to the currency fluctuation on these advances between the time the transaction occurs and the ultimate settlement of the transaction 
a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates at september  would result in a million change in our net income loss 
we mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short term inter company advances by the timely settlement of each transaction  generally within days
