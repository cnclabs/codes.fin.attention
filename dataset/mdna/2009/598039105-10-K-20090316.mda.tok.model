this act protects a company from unwarranted litigation if actual results differ from management expectations 
this management s discussion and analysis reflects management s current views and estimates of future economic circumstances  industry conditions  and the company s performance and financial results based on reasonable assumptions 
a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results and expectations expressed in the discussion 
these factors and uncertainties include  but are not limited to changes in interest rates and market prices that could affect the net interest margin  asset valuation  and expense levels  changes in local economic and business conditions that could adversely affect customers and their ability to repay borrowings under agreed upon terms and or adversely affect the value of the underlying collateral related to the borrowings  increased competition for deposits and loans which could affect rates and terms  changes in the levels of prepayments received on loans and investment securities that adversely affect the yield and value of the earning assets  a deviation in actual experience from the underlying assumptions used to determine and establish the allowance for loan losses all  changes in the availability of funds resulting from reduced liquidity or increased costs  the timing and impact of future acquisitions  the success or failure of integrating operations  and the ability to capitalize on growth opportunities upon entering new markets  the ability to acquire  operate  and maintain effective and efficient operating systems  increased asset levels and changes in the composition of assets which would impact capital levels and regulatory capital ratios  loss of critical personnel and the challenge of hiring qualified personnel at reasonable compensation levels  changes in government regulations applicable to financial holding companies and banking  and acts of terrorism  weather  or other events beyond the company s control 
critical accounting policies certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and general banking practices 
the company s most critical accounting policy relates to its allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of its borrowers to make loan payments 
if the financial condition of its borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the company s estimates would be updated and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
see asset quality allowance for loan losses 
another of the company s critical accounting policies relates to its goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment annually 
if the fair value of an asset exceeds the carrying amount of the asset  no charge to goodwill is made 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset  goodwill will be adjusted through a charge to earnings 
compliance with accounting for stock based compensation requires that management make assumptions including stock price volatility and employee turnover that are utilized to measure compensation expense 
the fair value of stock options granted is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
given the current instability of the economic environment  it is reasonably possible that the methodology of the assessment of potential loan losses  goodwill impairment  and other fair value measurements could change in the near term or could result in impairment going forward

the allowance is comprised of specific reserves assigned to each impaired loan for which probable loss has been identified as well as general reserves to maintain the allowance at an acceptable level for other loans in the portfolio where historical loss experience is available that indicates certain probable losses may exist 
factors considered in determining provisions include estimated losses in significant credits  known deterioration in concentrations of credit  historical loss experience  trends in nonperforming assets  volume  maturity and composition of the loan portfolio  off balance sheet credit risk  lending policies and control systems  national and local economic conditions  the experience  ability and depth of lending management  and the results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies and others 
the processes by which management determines the appropriate level of the allowance  and the corresponding provision for probable credit losses  involves considerable judgment  therefore  no assurance can be given that future losses will not vary from current estimates
