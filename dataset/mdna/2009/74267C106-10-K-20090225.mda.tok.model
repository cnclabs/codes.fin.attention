item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements which accompany this report 
throughout the discussion  references to proassurance  we  us and our refers to proassurance corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the discussion contains certain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
as discussed under forward looking statements  our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report on those statements 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on current and historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  reported results of operations may be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
management considers the following accounting estimates to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and the effect of those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve the largest component of our liabilities is our reserve for losses and the largest component of expense for our operations is incurred losses 
net losses in any period reflect our estimate of net losses incurred related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserve established for net losses of prior periods 
the estimation of professional liability losses is inherently difficult 
ultimate loss costs  even for claims with similar characteristics  vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to  the nature of the claim and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant s family  the outcome of jury trials  the legislative and judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and  for medical professional liability  the trend of health care costs 
professional liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
in establishing our reserve for losses  management considers a variety of factors including claims frequency  historical paid and incurred loss development trends  the effect of inflation  general economic trends and the legal and political environment 
we perform an in depth review of our reserve for losses on a semi annual basis 
additionally  during each reporting period we update and review the data underlying the estimation of our reserve for losses and make adjustments that we believe best reflect emerging data 
external actuaries review our reserve for losses at least semiannually in order to provide management with an independent viewpoint and broader perspective regarding our loss experience and industry loss trends 
we compile loss and exposure data from our own company experience which is analyzed by both the external actuaries and our internal actuarial staff 
in establishing reserves  management considers the estimates and inputs of our internal actuarial staff as well as those of our external actuaries 
factors considered by management and the actuaries in establishing reserves include known or estimated changes in the frequency and severity of claims  loss retention levels and premium rates 
as a result of the variety of factors that must be considered by management there is a significant risk that actual incurred losses will develop differently from these estimates 
in establishing our initial reserves for a given accident year we rely significantly on the loss assumptions embedded within our pricing 
because of the historically volatile nature of professional liability losses  we establish the initial loss estimates at a level which is approximately to above our pricing assumptions 
this difference recognizes the volatility of the professional liability loss environment and the risk in determining pricing parameters 
as each accident year matures we analyze reserves in a variety of ways and use multiple actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses  including bornhuetter ferguson method paid development method reported development method average paid value method average reported value method backward recursive method a brief description of each method follows 
the descriptions require some explanation as to how we and actuaries view our reserves 
we segment our reserves by accident year  which is the year in which the claim becomes our liability 
as claim payments are made  they are aggregated by accident year for analysis purposes 
we also segment our reserves by reserve type case reserves and ibnr incurred but not reported reserves 
case reserves are established by our claims department based upon the particular circumstances of each reported claim and represent our estimate of the future loss costs often referred to as expected losses that will be paid on reported claims 
case reserves are decremented as claim payments are made and are periodically adjusted upward or downward as claim department estimates regarding the amount of future losses are revised  reported loss is the case reserve at any point in time plus the claim payments that have been made to date 
ibnr reserves represent our estimate of the loss costs that will eventually be paid on all claims  less the case reserves we have established 
bornhuetter ferguson method 
we use both the paid and the reported bornhuetter ferguson methods 
the paid method assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year initial expected losses being the first established case and ibnr reserves for a specific accident year and partial weight to paid to date losses 
the reported method assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to current reported losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
paid development and reported development method 
these methods use historical  cumulative losses paid losses for the paid development method  reported losses for the reported development method by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment and case reserving environment for the reported development method  and  to the extent necessary  supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
average paid value and average reported value methods 
in these methods  average claim cost data paid claim cost for the average paid value method and reported claim cost for the reported value method is developed to an ultimate average cost level by report year based on historical data 
claim counts are similarly developed to an ultimate count level 
the average claim cost after rounding and adjustment  if necessary  to accommodate report year data that is not considered to be predictive is then multiplied by the ultimate claim counts by report year to derive ultimate loss and alae 
backward recursive development method 
this method is an extrapolation on the movements in case reserve adequacy in order to estimate unpaid loss costs 
historical data showing incremental changes to case reserves over progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the ratio of case reserve values at successive maturities 
historical claim payments data showing the additional payments in progressive time periods is used to derive factors that represent the portion of a case reserve paid in the following period 
starting from the most mature period  after which all the case reserve is paid and the case reserve is exhausted  the next prior ultimate development factor for the prior case reserve can be calculated as the case factor times the established ultimate development factor plus the paid factor 
for each successive prior maturity  the ultimate development factor is calculated similarly 
the result of multiplying the ultimate development factor times the case reserve is the total indicated unpaid 
generally  methods such as the bornhuetter ferguson method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis 
as time progresses and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data 
each of these methods treats our assumptions differently  and thus provides a different perspective for our reserve review 
the various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period 
in addition  we perform statistical reviews of claims data such as claim counts  average settlement costs and severity trends 
in performing these analyses we partition our business by coverage type  geography  layer of coverage and accident year 
this procedure is intended to balance the use of the most representative data for each partition  capturing its unique patterns of development and trends 
for each partition  the results of the various methods  along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as the current economic environment  are used to develop a point estimate based upon management s judgment and past experience 
the process of selecting the point estimate from the set of possible outcomes produced by the various actuarial methods is based upon the judgment of management and is not driven by formulaic determination 
for each partition of our business we select a point estimate with due regard for the age  characteristics and volatility of the partition of the business  the volume of data available for review and past experience with respect to the accuracy of estimates 
this series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses 
we have modeled implied reserve ranges around our single point reserve estimates for our professional liability business assuming different confidence levels 
the ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes 
the aggregation of this data takes into consideration the correlation among our geographic and specialty mix of business 
the result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition 
we have used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an and confidence interval for the potential outcome of our reserve for losses 
the high and low end points of the distributions are as follows low end point carried reserve high end point confidence level billion billion billion confidence level billion billion billion the claims environment in which we and others in our industry operate is inherently uncertain 
the development of a statistical distribution models the uncertainty as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data 
the distributions represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes and should not be confused with a range of best estimates 
given the number of factors considered it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 
any change in our estimate of the reserve is reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made as has been the case in  and reinsurance we use insurance and reinsurance collectively  reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement for certain losses we pay 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance 
at december  all ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transferring contracts 
our receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable under our reinsurance programs 
we base our estimate of funds recoverable upon our expectation of ultimate losses and the portion of those losses that we estimate to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
our assessment of the collectibility of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers the payment history of the reinsurer  publicly available financial and rating agency data  our interpretation of the underlying contracts and policies  and responses by reinsurers 
appropriate reserves are established for any balances we believe may not be collected 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of our losses  our estimates of losses and related amounts recoverable may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
also  we estimate premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements wherein the premium due to the reinsurer  subject to certain maximums and minimums  is based in part on losses reimbursed or to be reimbursed under the agreement 
any adjustments are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reinsurance balances  an adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
investment valuations we adopted a new accounting pronouncement  statement of financial accounting standards  fair value measurements  effective january  the new pronouncement revises the definition of fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
the pronouncement defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the framework establishes a three level hierarchy for valuing assets and liabilities based on how transparent observable the inputs are that are used to determine fair value 
for example  a quoted market price for an actively traded security on an established trading exchange is considered the most transparent observable input used to establish a fair value for that security and is classified as a level in the fair value hierarchy 
an investment valued using multiple broker dealer quotes is considered to be valued using observable input that is not as transparent as a quoted market price on an exchange and is classified as a level an investment valued using either a single broker dealer quote or based on a cash flow valuation model is considered to be valued based on limited observable input and a significant amount of judgment and is classified as level for further information on the adoption of the pronouncement and the fair value of our investments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
virtually all of our financial assets are comprised of investments recorded at fair value 
of the company s investments recorded at fair value totaling billion  approximately of our investments are based on observable market prices or observable market parameters ie broker quotes  benchmark yield curves  issuer spreads  bids  etc the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters referred to as observable inputs can vary from investment to investment 
we utilize observable inputs  where available  to value our investments 
in many cases  we obtain multiple observable inputs for an investment to derive the fair value without requiring significant judgments 
we use a pricing service  interactive data corporation idc  to value our investments that have an exchange traded price or multiple observable inputs 
we do not utilize idc to price investments that do not have multiple observable inputs level 
idc discloses the inputs used for each asset class that it prices 
we review the inputs for the asset classes we own in order to make the appropriate level designation 
all securities priced by idc using an exchange traded price are designated by us as level level investments are currently limited to exchange traded common and preferred equity securities  and money market funds with quoted net asset values navs 
we designate as level those securities not actively traded on an exchange for which idc uses multiple verifiable observable inputs including last reported trade  non binding broker quotes  benchmark yield curves  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  and assumed prepayment speeds 
idc provides a single price per instrument quoted 
we review the pricing for reasonableness each quarter by comparing market yields generated by the supplied price versus market yields observed in the market place 
if a supplied price is deemed unreasonable  we will challenge the price with idc and make adjustments if deemed necessary 
to date  we have not adjusted any prices supplied by idc 
for securities that do not have multiple observable inputs level  we do not rely on a price from idc 
our level assets  which primarily are private placements and limited partnerships  are valued by management either using non binding broker quotes or pricing models that utilize market based assumptions which have limited observable inputs including treasury yield levels  issuer spreads and non binding broker quotes 
the valuation techniques involve some degree of judgment 
approximately million of investments recorded at fair value are valued in this manner 
most of our investments recorded at fair value are considered available for sale with a small portion classified as trading 
for investments considered available for sale  changes in the fair value are recognized as unrealized gains and losses and are included  net of related tax effects  in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
gains or losses on these investments are recognized in earnings in the period the investment is sold or an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
changes in the fair value of investments considered as trading are recorded in realized investment gains and losses in the current period 
we also have other investments  primarily comprised of equity interests in private investment funds non public investment partnerships and limited liability companies  million of which are accounted for using the equity method and million of which are carried at cost 
we evaluate these investments for other than temporary impairment by considering any declines in fair value below the recorded value 
determining whether there has been a decline in fair value involves assumptions and estimates as there are typically no observable inputs to determine the fair value of these investments 
we evaluate all our investments on at least a quarterly basis for declines in fair value that represent other than temporary impairments 
some of the factors we consider in the evaluation of our investments are the extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its recorded basis  the length of time for which the fair value of the investment has been less than its recorded basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer underlying the investment  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available  third party research and credit rating reports  the extent to which the decline in fair value is attributable to credit risk specifically associated with an investment or its issuer  the extent to which we believe market assessments of credit risk for a specific investment or category of investments are either well founded or are speculative  our internal assessments and those of our external portfolio managers regarding specific circumstances surrounding an investment  which can cause us to believe the investment is more or less likely to recover its value than other investments with a similar structure  for asset backed securities the origination date of the underlying loans  the remaining average life  the probability that credit performance of the underlying loans will deteriorate in the future  and our assessment of the quality of the collateral underlying the loan  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
determining whether a decline in the fair value of investments is an other than temporary impairment may also involve a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded in established markets or during periods of market dislocation 
for example  assessing the value of certain investments requires us to perform an analysis of expected future cash flows or prepayments 
for investments in tranches of structured transactions  we are required to assess the credit worthiness of the underlying investments of the structured transaction 
when we judge a decline in fair value to be other than temporary  we reduce the basis of the investment to fair value and recognize a loss in the current period income statement for the amount of the reduction 
in subsequent periods  we base any measurement of gain or loss or decline in value upon the recorded cost basis of the investment 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting salaries  which are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal premiums  are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred policy acquisition costs each reporting period and any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period 
deferred taxes deferred federal income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities determined for financial reporting purposes and the basis determined for income tax purposes 
our temporary differences principally relate to loss reserves  unearned premiums  deferred policy acquisition costs  unrealized investment gains losses and investment impairments 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such benefits are realized 
we review our deferred tax assets quarterly for impairment 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management is required to make certain judgments and assumptions about the future operations of proassurance based on historical experience and information as of the measurement period regarding reversal of existing temporary differences  carryback capacity  future taxable income  including its capital and operating characteristics  and tax planning strategies 
goodwill we make at least an annual assessment as to whether the value of our goodwill assets is impaired 
management evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter and before the annual evaluation if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value 
in assessing goodwill  management estimates the fair value of the reporting unit and compares that estimate to external indictors such as market capitalization 
we concluded in  and that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and no adjustment to impair goodwill was necessary 
proassurance overview we are an insurance holding company and our operating results are primarily derived from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  all of which principally write medical and other professional liability insurance 
corporate strategy our mission is to be the preferred source of professional liability protection by providing unparalleled claims defense  highly responsive customer service and innovative risk management while maintaining our commitment to long term financial strength 
according to am best s analysis of data  we are the fifth largest medical professional liability insurance writer in the nation  and we believe we are the largest medical professional liability writer in our collective states of operation 
we believe that our strong reputation in our regional markets  combined with our financial strength  strong customer service and proven ability to manage claims  should enable us  over the long term  to profitably expand our position in select states 
we have successfully acquired and integrated companies and books of business in the past and believe our financial size and strength make us an attractive acquirer 
we emphasize disciplined underwriting and do not manage our business to achieve a certain level of premium growth or market share 
we apply our local knowledge to individual risk selection and determine the appropriate price based on our assessment of the specific characteristics of each risk 
in addition to prudent risk selection  we seek to control our underwriting results through effective claims management 
we investigate each claim and have fostered a strong culture of defending claims that we believe have no merit 
we manage claims at the local level  tailoring claims handling to the legal climate of each state  which we believe differentiates us from national writers 
through our regional underwriting and claims office structure  we are able to gain a strong understanding of local market conditions and efficiently adapt our underwriting and claims strategies to regional conditions 
our regional presence also allows us to maintain active relationships with our customers and be more responsive to their needs 
we understand the importance of the professional identity and reputation of our insureds 
an important part of our strategy is to emphasize the needs of our insureds throughout our operations 
we attempt to further our understanding of those needs through the use of advisory boards and operational committees that ensure we understand the challenges facing our insureds and ways we may best assist them 
we also believe that it is important to employ medical and legal professionals throughout our organization  especially on our senior management team 
we emphasize our pledge that each insured professional will be treated fairly in all of our conduct with them and that all of our business actions will be informed by the core values that guide our organization integrity  respect  doctor involvement  collaboration  communication and enthusiasm 
we believe our strategy allows us to compete on a basis other than just price 
we also believe that our presence in local markets allows us to monitor and understand changes in the liability climate and thus develop better business strategies in a timely manner 
we have sustained our financial stability during difficult market conditions through responsible pricing and loss reserving practices and through conservative investment practices 
we are committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage and conservatively investing our assets 
we recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the financial strength of our principal insurance subsidiaries and we intend to manage our business to protect our financial security 
we measure performance in a number of ways  but particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns  both of which directly affect our return on equity roe 
we target a long term average roe of to 
we believe that a focus on rate adequacy  selective underwriting and effective claims management is required if we are to achieve our roe targets 
we closely monitor premium revenues  losses and loss adjustment costs  and acquisition  underwriting and insurance expenses 
our overall investment strategy is to focus on maximizing current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety  liquidity  duration and portfolio diversification 
we engage in activities that generate other income  however  such activities  principally fee and agency services  do not constitute a significant use of our resources or a significant source of revenues or profits 
growth opportunities and outlook we expect our long term growth to come through controlled expansion in states where we are already writing business and into additional states within  or adjacent to  our existing business footprint 
we also look to expand through the acquisition of other companies or books of business  however  such expansion is opportunistic and cannot be predicted 
we face price based competition in virtually all of our markets  with some competitors offering coverage at rates that we believe do not meet our long term profitability goals 
additionally  a number of physicians and hospitals are seeking to lower their costs through the use of alternative risk transfer approaches such as self insurance and risk sharing pools  although these alternatives become less attractive as prices soften in the traditional insurance markets 
our on going commitment to adequate rates and strong underwriting standards affects our willingness to write new business and to renew existing business in the face of this price based competition 
improvements in loss cost trends have allowed us to reduce rates in certain markets during and to offer targeted new business and renewal retention programs in selected markets 
in we launched a new branding campaign  treated fairly  which we believe will help us emphasize our fair treatment of our insureds and other important stakeholders 
we are emphasizing treated fairly in all of our activities  and we believe that as we reach more customers with this message we will both improve retention and add new insureds  both of which will help offset the effects of lower rates 
we also believe our recent acquisition of georgia lawyers which will be merged into pra casualty and mid continent  along with our pending acquisition of pica will add at least million of premium during in addition to providing an avenue for premium growth  we believe these transactions will also broaden our business footprint and diversify our book of business 
pica will become part of proassurance in the second quarter of if its eligible policyholders approve the planned sponsored demutualization 
pica is the nation s leading provider of professional liability insurance to doctors of podiatric medicine  with a market share of approximately 
pica insures approximately  podiatric physicians in states and the district of columbia  and its paco subsidiary provides professional liability insurance for approximately  chiropractors and writes errors omissions insurance for a small  but growing  number of independent insurance agents 
pica wrote approximately million in premium in  has million in total assets and has maintained an am best rating of a excellent for the past years 
pica s near universal licensure will help us become a national writer of medical professional liability insurance  and its experience in markets in which we do not write could make it easier for us to expand our existing medical professional liability lines 
further  its experience in writing high volume  lower cost professional liability policies  such as those for chiropractors  will be advantageous as we expand our allied health care professional liability business 
we expect our acquisition of mid continent  which closed in january of  to also broaden our market presence in the rapidly expanding professional liability market for allied health care providers such as nurse practitioners  home health care nurses  medical technicians and other similar professionals 
under almost every likely healthcare reform scenario these professionals are likely to have a greater role in the delivery of health care and we believe their need for professional liability coverages will expand as their responsibilities expand 
mid continent  which underwrote approximately million in premium in  also underwrites other lines of professional and general liability coverage 
in  mid continent generated approximately million of premium for proassurance 
business they underwrite  but do not place with proassurance  will generate commission income for us 
our acquisition of georgia lawyers was completed in february of  and we believe we can use that business as a springboard for expansion in the legal professional liability market throughout the southeast 
we have written legal professional liability insurance for attorneys in indiana  michigan and ohio since we have publicly stated our intention to double our premiums from this line of business to million  and we expect georgia lawyers to help us achieve that goal 
georgia lawyers wrote approximately million of direct written premium in  and insured about  attorneys  most in small to medium sized practices 
this increases the size of our legal professional liability book  in terms of both premium and insureds  by approximately 
we have also taken steps to broaden the distribution of our legal professional liability policies by adding business through grayhawk general agency  inc grayhawk and prolawyer insurance  llc prolawyer 
grayhawk  which is based in the phoenix area  solicits business in arizona  california  colorado  nevada  and washington  and seeks to expand its business throughout the west 
prolawyer  based in philadelphia  writes business in delaware  the district of columbia  maryland  new jersey  pennsylvania  and virginia  and seeks to expand in the mid atlantic states 
recent accounting pronouncements and guidance in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  which will alter the accounting for our convertible debentures 
fsp apb requires issuers to account for convertible debt securities that allow for either mandatory or optional cash settlement including partial cash settlement by separating the liability and equity components in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance and requires recognition of additional non cash interest expense in subsequent periods based on the nonconvertible rate 
additionally  fsp apb requires that when such debt instruments are repaid or converted any consideration transferred at settlement is to be allocated between the extinguishment of the liability component and the reacquisition of the equity component 
fsp apb will become effective for proassurance on january  and must be applied retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment being made as of the earliest period presented 
early adoption is not permitted 
in july of we converted all of our outstanding convertible debentures and are currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on our financial condition and results of operations but expect no impact on total stockholders equity 
in december the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we will adopt the statement on its effective date 
the adoption is not expected to have an effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in december the fasb issued sfas revised december  business combinations 
sfas r replaces fasb statement no 
 business combinations  but retains the fundamental requirement in sfas that the acquisition method referred to as the purchase method in sfas of accounting be used for all business combinations 
sfas r provides new or additional guidance with respect to business combinations including defining the acquirer in a transaction  the valuation of assets and liabilities when noncontrolling interests exist  the treatment of contingent consideration  the treatment of costs incurred to effect the acquisition  the treatment of reorganization costs  and the valuation of assets and liabilities when the purchase price is below the net fair value of assets acquired 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we will adopt the statement on its effective date 
accounting changes fsp eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no  was issued in january to amend the impairment guidance in eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets 
eitf specifies that an impairment is considered other than temporary if  based on an estimate of cash flows that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value  there has been an adverse change in those estimated cash flows 
fsp eitf alters this guidance by specifying that an impairment be considered other than temporary if it is probable there has been an adverse change in the holder s estimated cash flows from those previously projected 
we adopted fsp eitf as of december  and considered the guidance provided therein in our impairment evaluations performed as of december  there was no material effect from adoption 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
the standard revises the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is applicable to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements but does not establish new guidance regarding the assets and liabilities required or allowed to be measured at fair value 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted sfas on january  we did not recognize any cumulative effect related to the adoption of sfas and the adoption did not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas permits many financial assets and liabilities to be reported at fair value that are not otherwise required under gaap to be measured at fair value 
under sfas guidance  the election of fair value treatment is specific to individual assets and liabilities  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur 
the election of fair value measurement is generally irrevocable 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted sfas on january  but did not elect fair value measurement for any financial assets or liabilities that were not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
liquidity and capital resources and financial condition overview proassurance corporation is a holding company and is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
because it has no other business operations  dividends from its operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for its obligations  including debt service 
the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limitation by state insurance regulations 
see our discussions under regulation of dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries in part i  and in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the ordinary dividends that can be paid by our insurance subsidiaries in at december  we held cash and investments of approximately million outside of our insurance subsidiaries that are available for use without regulatory approval 
cash of approximately million will be used in the proassurance sponsored demutualization of pica  million of which will be a surplus contribution to pica 
the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows the principal components of our operating cash flows are the excess of net investment income and premiums collected over net losses paid and operating costs  including income taxes 
timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the ultimate payment of losses 
premiums are generally collected within the twelve month period after the policy is written while our claim payments are generally paid over a more extended period of time 
likewise  timing delays exist between the payment of claims and the collection of any associated reinsurance recoveries 
our operating activities provided positive cash flows of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in operating cash flows during as compared to is primarily attributable to in millions cash flow increase decrease lower premium receipts due to the decline in premiums written increase in net premium payments to reinsurers  including the effect of refunds received related to prior years  greater refunds were received in net trading securities purchases in versus net trading securities sales in decrease in gross losses paid increase in reinsurance recoveries  including commutation receipts of million other amounts not individually significant  net net decrease in operating cash flows two metrics commonly used to analyze the operating cash flows of insurance companies are the net paid to incurred ratio and the net paid loss ratio 
year ended december net paid to incurred ratio net paid loss ratio the net paid to incurred ratio is calculated as net paid losses divided by net incurred losses 
the net paid loss ratio is calculated as net paid losses divided by net premiums earned 
in calculating both of these ratios  net paid losses is defined as losses and loss adjustment expenses paid during the period  net of the anticipated reinsurance recoveries related to those losses 
for a long tailed business such as proassurance  fluctuations in the ratios over short periods of time are not unexpected and are not necessarily indicative of either positive or negative changes in loss experience 
the timing of our indemnity payments is affected by many factors  including the nature and number of the claims in process during any one period and the speed at which cases work through the trial and appellate process 
the ratios are affected not only by variations in net paid losses  but also by variations in premium volume and the recognition of reserve development 
while net paid losses decreased in as compared to both the net paid loss ratio and net paid to incurred ratio increased

we manage our investments to ensure that we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations  taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments  including interest payments  dividends and principal payments  as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations 
approximately million of our investments mature or are paid down in a given quarter and are available  if needed  to meet our cash flow requirements 
at our insurance subsidiaries level  the primary outflow of cash is related to net paid losses and operating costs  including income taxes 
the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  we rely upon the history of paid claims in estimating the timing of future claims payments 
to the extent that we have an unanticipated shortfall in cash we may either liquidate securities or borrow funds under previously established borrowing arrangements 
however  given the relatively short duration of our investments  we do not foresee any such shortfall 
we held cash and short term securities of million at december  as compared to million at december  the increased balance as of december  reflected our intent to hold additional highly liquid assets in response to the instability of credit markets as well as to meet the funding requirements for our planned acquisitions with pica  mid continent and georgia lawyers 
the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at december  is years  the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities and our short term securities combined is years 
the duration of our fixed maturity securities has shortened due to expected prepayments on mortgage backed securities increasing 
in september  unprecedented events occurred in the financial markets which affected our investment results 
our investment portfolio was directly affected by the us treasury conservatorship of federal national mortgage association fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  the declaration of bankruptcy by lehman brothers holding  inc lehman  the federal reserve s lending facility to american international group  inc aig  and the ratings downgrades and subsequent fdic facilitated sale of washington mutual bank washington mutual 
in connection with these events  the net asset value of our investment in the reserve primary fund the reserve fund  a money market fund  fell below per share on a market value basis due to a combination of holdings of short term securities issued by lehman brothers and major shareholder redemptions 
during  our portfolio of asset backed securities  particularly mortgage backed securities  has been impacted by the dramatic deterioration of the real estate market due to a significant increase in home foreclosures and commercial delinquencies 
we realized the following losses on our investments in in thousands net gains from sales other than temporary impairment losses corporate equity asset backed securities other trading portfolio losses net realized investment losses includes million related to lehman 
includes million related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
due to our financial strength and capital position  these realized losses have not had and are not expected to have an impact on our ability to fund capital requirements 
furthermore  we have accumulated sufficient liquidity in the form of highly liquid assets to meet our capital needs until order is restored to the market 
our investment portfolio continues to be comprised of high quality fixed income securities with approximately of our fixed maturities being either united states government agency or investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies 
as a result of the turmoil in the us credit markets  the overall value of fixed maturity securities declined in at december  we continue to hold fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position with pretax net unrealized losses of approximately million as compared to pretax net unrealized gains of million as of december  the declines reflect the effect of increased market rates for securities not considered risk free as well as widespread concern regarding the credit quality of mortgages and financial institutions  the future of the us credit markets in general and fears that the us will experience a severe economic recession 
it is our belief that we will recover the recorded cost basis of the fixed maturity securities that we hold in an unrealized loss position 
we consider the declines in value to be temporary because we have the intent  and  due to the duration of our overall portfolio and positive cash flows  we have the ability to hold the securities to recovery of book value or maturity 
at december  we held asset backed securities with a fair value of million recorded cost basis of million 
in  we realized million of losses on asset backed securities as reflected in the table above primarily relating to mortgage backed securities impacted by the deterioration of the housing market 
in performing our other than temporary impairment assessment of mortgage backed securities  management projects expected cash flows  making assumptions regarding expected foreclosure rates and the value of collateral available to recover losses 
if estimated cash flows project a loss  an other than temporary impairment is realized for the difference between the book value and fair value of the security in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in some cases  the impairment loss is greater than the projected loss because market values are depressed as a result of market uncertainty and an aversion to risk by market participants 
if we continue to hold these securities  and our estimates of projected loss prove over time to be accurate  the economic loss that we ultimately realize will be less than the impairment loss that has been recorded 
conversely  because our judgments about future foreclosure rates  the timing of expected cash flows and the estimated value of collateral may not prove over time to be accurate  we may experience losses on asset backed securities that we are not currently projecting 
mortgage backed securities are generally categorized according to the expected credit quality of underlying mortgage loans 
generally  subprime loans are issued to borrowers with lower credit ratings while alt a borrowers have better credit ratings but the mortgage loan is of a type regarded as having a higher risk profile 
as of december   we directly hold securities with a fair value of approximately million recorded cost basis of approximately million and rated aaa  aa  a  bbb or bb and a beneficial interest in securities with a fair value of approximately  recorded cost basis of approximately million and average rating of b that are supported by collateral we classify as subprime 
we also have subprime exposure of approximately million through our interests in private investments funds 
we also hold securities with a fair value of approximately million recorded cost basis of approximately million that are supported by privately issued residential mortgage backed securities we classify as alt a  of which approximately are aaa rated  are aa  are a 
ratings given are as of december  during we evaluated our securities with subprime and alt a exposures and recognized other than temporary impairments of million for the year ended december  some of our investments have become less liquid than they have historically been due to the extreme market volatility and disruption experienced in while the markets for these securities have temporarily become more intermittent and less active  trades are occurring 
we determine the fair value of these securities by obtaining information from idc which includes trade data 
we confirmed the reasonableness of the fair value of these securities as of december  by reviewing market yields of the securities 
current yields are substantially elevated and reflect those seen on similar securities of similar credit quality and collateral 
in addition to those securities which have become illiquid as a result of current market disruptions  we have historically purchased certain other investments that do not have a readily available market  including private placements  limited partnerships  inverse coupon mortgage backed securities  municipal auction rate securities and federal home loan bank fhlb capital stock 
the net unrealized gains losses as of december  associated with securities currently considered to be illiquid are detailed in the following table 
in thousands values at december  net unrealized fair value gains losses fixed maturities  available for sale mortgage backed securities classified as inverse coupon alt a subprime prime  privately issued prime  agency issued other asset backed securities timber land hotel manufactured housing other corporate bonds privately placed municipal auction rated bonds equity  available for sale privately placed we believe the fair values of these securities reflect declines due to the market disruptions and are below the true economic value 
the unrealized losses should reverse over the remaining lives of the securities should no further deterioration of collateral relative to our position in the securities capital structures be experienced 
financial institutions and asset backed securities  as a whole  have been particularly affected by the market events noted above 
the overall us economy has also experienced a downturn which is expected to continue in the us government recently enacted legislation and created several programs to help stabilize credit markets and financial institutions and restore liquidity  including the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  the federal reserve s commercial paper funding facility cpff and money market investor funding facility and the federal deposit insurance corporations fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the eesa authorizes the secretary of the us treasury to establish the troubled asset relief program tarp for the repurchase of up to billion of mortgage backed securities and other troubled financial instruments from financial institutions 
among other eesa provisions are tax code revisions  budget measures  guidance related to the administration of tarp  and measures intended to mitigate mortgage foreclosures 
additional government actions are expected in to stimulate the economy 
it is difficult to predict how recently enacted legislation and future government actions will impact the economy  certain industry sectors and specifically the value of certain investments we hold 
we continue to monitor our exposure to financial institutions 
our largest exposures  including both fixed maturity and equity securities  are to bank of america million  morgan stanley million  and wells fargo million 
our concentration of exposure to these institutions has increased as a result of the acquisition of merrill lynch by bank of america and the acquisition of wachovia by wells fargo 
losses the following table  known as the reserve development table  presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to the development of our estimates of losses during that time period 
years prior to relate only to the reserves of proassurance s predecessor  medical assurance 
in years and thereafter the table reflects the reserves of proassurance  formed in in order to merge medical assurance and professionals group 
pra national reserves are included only in the year and thereafter 
pra wisconsin reserves are included only in the year and thereafter 
the table does not include the reserves of our personal lines operations  which are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
the table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of reinsurance recoverables 
the gross liability for losses before reinsurance  as shown on the balance sheet  and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table 
we do not discount our reserve for losses to present value 
information presented in the table is cumulative and  accordingly  each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years 
the table presents the development of our balance sheet reserve for losses  it does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is not appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
the following may be helpful in understanding the reserve development table the line entitled reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables reflects our reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense  less the receivables from reinsurers  each as reported in our consolidated financial statements at the end of each year the balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled cumulative net paid  as of reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled re estimated net liability as of reflects the re estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as balance sheet reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of additional liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year the net re estimated liability 
the line entitled net cumulative redundancy deficiency reflects the difference between the previously recorded balance sheet reserve for each applicable year and the net re estimated liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year 
analysis of reserve development in thousands december  reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables cumulative net paid  as of one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later re estimated net liability as of end of year one year later two years later three years later four years later five years later six years later seven years later eight years later nine years later ten years later net cumulative redundancy deficiency original gross liability end of year less reinsurance recoverables original net liability end of year gross re estimated liability latest re estimated reinsurance recoverables net re estimated liability latest gross cumulative redundancy deficiency in each year reflected in the table  we have estimated our reserve for losses utilizing the actuarial methodologies discussed in critical accounting estimates 
these techniques are applied to the data in a consistent manner and the resulting projections are evaluated by management to establish the estimate of the reserve 
factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development are primarily related to the extended period of time required to resolve medical professional liability claims and include the following prior to the mid to late s our business was largely based in alabama 
when we began to expand geographically  we utilized industry based data as well as our own data to support our actuarial projection process 
our own claims experience proved to be better than the projected experience  but again  this was not known for some time after the reserves were established 
ultimately  as actual results proved better than that suggested by historical trends and industry claims data  redundancies developed and were recognized 
the medical professional liability legal environment deteriorated in the late s 
beginning in  we recognized adverse trends in claim severity causing increased estimates of certain loss liabilities 
as a result  favorable development of prior year reserves slowed in and reversed in and we addressed these trends through increased rates  stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures 
during  and we have recognized favorable development related to our previously established reserves primarily for accident years through because we have reduced our estimates of claims severity related to those years 
based on recent internal and industry claims data  we believe claims severity ie  the average size of a claim is increasing at a rate slower than we estimated when our reserves for those years were established 
activity in our net reserve for losses during  and is summarized below in thousands year ended december balance  beginning of year less receivable from reinsurers net balance  beginning of year reserves acquired from acquisitions  net of receivable from reinsurers of million in incurred related to current year prior years total incurred paid related to current year prior years total paid net balance  end of year plus receivable from reinsurers balance  end of year at december  our gross reserve for losses included case reserves of approximately billion and ibnr reserves of approximately billion 
our consolidated reserve for losses on a gaap basis exceeds the combined reserves of our insurance subsidiaries on a statutory basis by approximately million  which is principally due to the portion of the gaap reserve for losses that is reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums 
these unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements tail coverage issued without a premium charge upon death  disability  or retirement of an insured 
reinsurance we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write larger limits of liability  to provide protection against losses in excess of policy limits  and to stabilize underwriting results in years in which higher losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
we generally reinsure professional liability risks under annual treaties pursuant to which the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention of million per claim  up to the maximum individual limit offered currently million 
historically  per claim retention levels have varied between the first  and the first million depending on the coverage year and the state in which business was written 
periodically  we provide insurance to policyholders above the maximum limits of our primary reinsurance treaties 
in those situations  we reinsure the excess risk above the limits of our reinsurance treaties on a facultative basis  whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit 
our reinsurance treaties are renegotiated annually 
there was no significant change in the cost or structure of the treaties renewed on october  our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including our risk appetite and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of experience and our analysis of the potential underwriting results within each state 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
our reinsurance broker assists us in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
we base our reinsurance buying decisions on an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate 
we have not experienced significant collection difficulties due to the financial condition of any reinsurer  however  periodically  reinsurers may dispute our claim for reimbursement from them 
we have established appropriate reserves for any balances that we believe may not be ultimately collected 
should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer will not meet its obligations to us  adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations 
such an adjustment has the potential to be significant to the results of operations in the period in which it is recorded  however  we would not expect such an adjustment to have a material effect on our capital position or our liquidity 
at december  our receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses is million and our receivable from reinsurers on paid losses is million

both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payments indicated 
our operating lease obligations are primarily for the rental of office space and office equipment 
each of our debt instruments allows for repayment before maturity  at our option  on or after certain dates

during the year ended december   we repurchased approximately million of our common shares having a total cost of million and reacquired debt for million 
as of december   the repurchase authorization remaining available for use is approximately million 
litigation we are involved in various legal actions arising primarily from claims against us related to insurance policies and claims handling  including  but not limited to  claims asserted by our policyholders 
legal actions are generally divided into two categories those dealing with claims and claim related activities which we consider in our evaluation of our reserve for losses  and those falling outside of these areas which we evaluate and account for as a part of our other liabilities 
claim related actions are considered as a part of our reserving process under the guidance provided by sfas accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
we evaluate the likely outcomes from these actions giving consideration to the facts and laws applicable to each case  appellate issues  coverage issues  potential recoveries from our insurance and reinsurance programs  and settlement discussions as well as our historical claims resolution practices 
this data is then given consideration in the overall evaluation of our reserve for losses 
for non claim related actions we evaluate each case separately and establish what we believe is an appropriate reserve under the guidance provided by sfas accounting for contingencies 
as a result of the acquisition of ncric in  we assumed the risk of loss for a judgment entered against pra national on february  by a district of columbia superior court in favor of columbia hospital for women medical center  inc chw in the amount of million the judgment 
the judgment was appealed to the district of columbia court of appeals  which affirmed the judgment in october and denied pra national s petition for rehearing in january we included a liability of million related to the judgment and post trial interest as a component of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the allocation of the pra national purchase price in  and have continued to accrue additional post trial interest 
the judgment plus post trial interest is expected to be paid in the second quarter of there are risks  as outlined in our risk factors in part  that any of these actions could cost us more than our estimates 
in particular  we or our insureds may receive adverse verdicts  post trial motions may be denied  in whole or in part  any appeals that may be undertaken may be unsuccessful  we may be unsuccessful in our legal efforts to limit the scope of coverage available to insureds  and we may become a party to bad faith litigation over the resolution of a claim 
to the extent that the cost of resolving these actions exceeds our estimates  the legal actions could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which any such action is resolved 
overview of results years ended december  and net income totals million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  net income per diluted share is and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable both to the increase in net income and a decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding 
results from the years ended december  and  respectively  compare as follows revenues net premiums earned have declined in by approximately million 
the decline reflects rate reductions implemented to reflect favorable loss trends and the effects of a highly competitive market place 
our net investment result  which includes both net investment income and earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries  has declined in by million 
the decline primarily reflects lower interest rates on short term funds during and unfavorable conditions in the credit markets 
net realized investment losses during are almost million as compared to net realized investment losses of million in  primarily due to other than temporary impairments of million in the impairments are primarily related to our investments in the preferred stock of fannie mae and freddie mac  and debt securities issued by lehman brothers

the change in premiums is driven by three primary factors  our ability and desire to retain expiring business  the change in premium rates we charge on the business we do renew  which can also be affected by the coverage an insured chooses to purchase  and the production of new business 
during our retention rate remained above which is consistent with prior years 
the professional liability market place remains extremely competitive and many of our competitors have been aggressive  particularly in pricing their products to retain their existing business as well as in seeking new business 
the decline in premiums during also reflects the fact that overall  we are charging our insureds less given the favorable trends that have been emerging in losses 
during and we have recognized improving loss trends in our rate making analysis  and have lowered the rates we charge our insureds where indicated 
as policies take effect at these lower rates our premiums written have declined 
for our physician business  which is discussed in more detail below  our charged rates on renewed business reflect an average decrease of for charged rates include the effects of filed rates  surcharges and discounts 
finally  the acquisition of new business continues to be challenging 
despite competitive pressures  we remain committed to a rate structure that will allow us to fulfill our obligations to our insureds  while still generating fair returns for our stockholders 
physician premiums represent and of gross premiums written during and  respectively 
amounts written in have declined as compared to  as shown below 
in thousands year ended december change physician premiums exclusive of tail premiums as discussed below our overall retention rate is approximately for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the retention rate is driven by several factors 
our underwriting evaluation may cause us to non renew an insured 
an insured may leave the practice of medicine through death  disability or retirement and  finally  we may lose business due to pricing or other issues  to our competitors or to self insurance mechanisms 
premiums written for non physician coverages represent and of our total gross premiums written for years ended december  and  respectively 
in thousands year ended december change non physician premiums hospital and facility other non physician exclusive of tail premiums as discussed below hospital and facility coverages are the most significant component of non physician premiums and represent and of our total gross premiums written for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other non physician coverages consist primarily of professional liability coverages provided to lawyers and to other health care professionals such as dentists and allied health professionals 
we are seeing the same competitive pressures in these areas as we are seeing in our physician business 
we are required to offer extended reporting endorsement or tail policies to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us  but we do not market such coverages separately 
the amount of tail premium written and earned can vary widely from period to period 
tail premiums totaled approximately million and million gross written premiums for both comparative periods for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million 
many of our competitors are offering prior acts coverage to induce insureds to change insurance carriers 
the availability of prior acts coverage negates the need for a non renewing insured to purchase a tail policy 
premiums earned in thousands year ended december change premiums earned because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
our policies generally carry a term of one year 
tail premiums are earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
exclusive of the effect of tail premiums  the decline in premiums earned for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in reflects declines in gross premiums written during and also  premiums earned in include million that originated from unearned premiums acquired in the merger with pra wisconsin 
during the twelve months preceding december   our written premiums have declined as compared to written premiums for the twelve months preceding december  consequently  earned premiums are expected to continue to be lower than earned premiums 
premiums ceded in thousands year ended december change premiums ceded premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the premium that we cede to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience subject to minimums and maximums of the business ceded to them 
it takes a number of years before all losses are known  and in the intervening period  premiums due to the reinsurers are estimated 
exclusive of amounts included in the following table  our reinsurance expense ratio premiums ceded as a percentage of premiums earned averages in both and premiums ceded in both and include amounts related to commutations and amounts resulting from changes to our estimates of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years  as follows 
in millions year ended december premiums ceded  before commutations and estimate changes effect of commutations estimate changes  prior accident years premiums ceded  adjusted the amount of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years can vary significantly because certain prior year reinsurance agreements adjust premiums based on loss experience  others do not 
also we have reached premium maximums for certain agreements  but not for others 
net investment income  net realized investment gains losses  equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries net investment income in thousands year ended december change net investment income net investment income is primarily derived from the income earned by our fixed maturity securities and also includes income from our short term  trading portfolio and cash equivalent investments  dividend income from equity securities  earnings from other investments and increases in the cash surrender value of business owned executive life insurance contracts 
investment fees and expenses are deducted from investment income 
net investment income by investment category is as follows in thousands year ended december change fixed maturities equities short term investments other invested assets business owned life insurance investment expenses net investment income fixed maturities 
the increase in income from our investment in fixed maturities primarily reflects some improvement in yields  which are more pronounced on a tax equivalent basis because we shifted funds into state and municipal bonds as progressed 
although bond yields increased in  we did not increase our fixed maturity holdings significantly due to unstable market conditions 
average yields for our available for sale fixed maturity securities during and are as follows year ended december average income yield average tax equivalent income yield short term investments 
the decrease in earnings from short term investments reflects a decline in market interest rates an average of basis points in as compared to other invested assets 
the decline in income from other invested assets reflects a million reduction in distributions from our investment in a private fund accounted for on a cost basis  as a result of turmoil in the debt markets 
because we recognize income related to these funds as it is distributed to us  our income from these holdings can vary significantly from period to period 
equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries in thousands year ended december change equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries is derived from our investment interests in three private funds accounted for on the equity method 
the funds primarily hold trading portfolios  and changes in the fair value of securities held by the fund are included in current earnings of the fund 
the performance of two funds reflects the decline and volatility of equity and credit markets  and we experienced negative returns from our interest in these funds during the third fund is an early phase private equity fund of funds that is still incurring the costs associated with its startup phase 
net realized investment gains losses the components of net realized investment gains losses are shown in the following table 
in thousands year ended december net gains losses from sales other than temporary impairment losses corporate equity asset backed securities other trading portfolio gains losses net realized investment gains losses includes million related to lehman 
includes million related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock 
during we recognized other than temporary impairment losses of  during the first quarter  million during the second quarter  million during the third quarter  and million during the fourth quarter 
losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies  which represent the majority of the company s business  the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
the following table summarizes calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
in millions net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december change change current accident year prior accident years calendar year net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
our current accident year loss ratio increased in  as compared to the increase in our current accident year ratio primarily reflects an increase to our reserve for the death  disability and retirement provision ddr in our claims made policies 
during  we recognized favorable loss development of million  on a net basis  related to reserves established in prior years 
principally this is due to favorable net loss development for the to accident years within our retained layers of coverage million and below  but also includes favorable development of million due to the commutation of prior year reinsurance agreements during the favorable development is based upon observation of actual claims data which indicates that claims severity is below our initial expectations 
given both the long tailed nature of our business and the past volatility of claims  we are generally cautious in recognizing the impact of the underlying trends that lead to the recognition of favorable net loss development 
as we conclude that sufficient data with respect to these trends exists to credibly impact our actuarial analysis we take appropriate actions 
in the case of the claims severity trends for  we believe it is appropriate to recognize the impact of these trends in our actuarial evaluation of prior period loss estimates while also remaining cautious about the past volatility of claims severity 
during we recognized favorable net loss development of million  related to our previously established prior accident year reserves  primarily to reflect reductions in our estimates of claim severity  within our retained layer of risk  for the through accident years 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations

periodically we receive refunds of previous assessments 
additionally  certain states permit us to recoup previous guaranty fund assessments through surcharges to our insureds 
in refunds recoupments exceeded assessments and reduced underwriting expense by million 
in net guaranty fund assessments increased underwriting expense by approximately  the amounts recouped through surcharges collected from our insureds approximated million for and  for during both and  the amounts recouped primarily relate to assessment previously paid to the florida insurance guaranty association  inc we estimate that recoupments in will approximate  we are unable to estimate assessments that might be declared in interest expense interest expense decreased in as compared to primarily because our average outstanding debt declined from million in to million in see note for details of debt redemption and conversion

interest expense by debt obligation is provided in the following table in thousands year ended december change convertible debentures subordinated debentures tps tps debentures surplus notes other taxes our effective tax rate for each period is significantly lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is tax exempt 
during our tax exempt income grew at a faster rate than did our taxable income which decreased our overall effective tax rate 
the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income other effective tax rate we did not recognize any valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in we expect to be able to realize the full benefit of deferred tax assets associated with impairment losses because capital gains were recognized during the statutory carryback period that are sufficient to absorb the impairment losses 
effect of acquisition we acquired pra wisconsin effective august  operating results for the year ended december  include pra wisconsin results for the entire period 
our results for the year ended december  include pra wisconsin results only for the five month period subsequent to the date of acquisition

our results benefited from an increased amount of favorable loss development 
we recognized favorable loss development in of million as compared to million in also  net investment income increased by almost million in due to growth in our invested assets and a modest improvement in yields 
these benefits were partially offset by a decline in net premiums earned of million  an increase in our current year loss ratio of approximately percentage points and an increase in our expense ratio of almost percentage points

additional premiums from the acquisition of pra wisconsin partially offset the reduction in premium in our existing book of business the operations of pra wisconsin are included for twelve months in versus five months in in periods of market softening  our strategy is to maintain our underwriting and pricing discipline and grow primarily through selective acquisitions 
we face strong price based competition in virtually all of our markets  with some competitors offering coverage at rates that we do not believe to be profitable on a long term basis 
additionally  a number of physicians and hospitals are seeking to lower their costs through the use of alternative risk transfer approaches such as self insurance and risk sharing pools  although these alternatives become less attractive as prices soften in the traditional insurance markets 
our ongoing commitment to adequate rates and strong underwriting standards affects our willingness to write new business and to renew existing business in the face of this price based competition 
improvements in loss cost trends have allowed us to reduce rates in certain markets during and to offer targeted new business and renewal retention programs in selected markets 
while this improves retention of business  it decreases our average premium rates

we are required to offer extended reporting endorsement or tail policies to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us  but we do not market such coverages separately 
the amount of tail premium written and earned can vary widely from period to period 
because of this volatility  we separate premiums associated with tail coverages from our other premiums 
in  tail premiums totaled million of gross written premiums  a decrease of million as compared to premiums earned in thousands year ended december change premiums earned pra pre acquisition business pra wisconsin acquisition    n a because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
our policies generally carry a term of one year 
tail premiums are earned in the period written because the policies insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods and are not cancellable 
exclusive of the effect of tail premiums  the decline in premiums earned in reflects on a pro rata basis declines in gross premiums written during and  as well as reduced earned premium benefit related to acquisitions 
in the twelve months that follow the acquisition of an insurance subsidiary  our premiums earned include premiums related to the subsidiary s unexpired policies on the date of acquisition unearned premium 
such premiums are earned over the remaining term of the associated policy 
in  earned premium includes approximately million related to the unexpired policies acquired in the pra wisconsin transaction 
in  earned premium includes approximately million related to unexpired policies acquired in the pra wisconsin and pra national transactions 
premiums ceded premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we pay our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
the premium that we cede to our reinsurers is determined  in part  by the loss experience subject to minimums and maximums of the business ceded to them 
it takes a number of years before all losses are known  and in the intervening period premiums due to the reinsurer are estimated 
ceded premium estimates are revised as loss estimates are revised 
during  we reduced premiums ceded by approximately million due to the commutation of certain reinsurance arrangements 
during we reduced premiums ceded by approximately million due to the commutation of certain reinsurance arrangements 
we increased ceded premiums by million in and reduced ceded premiums by million in to reflect changes to our estimates of the amount of reinsurance premiums due for prior accident years 
the amount of reinsurance premiums incurred for prior accident years can vary significantly because certain prior year reinsurance agreements adjust premiums based on loss experience  others do not 
also we have reached premium maximums for certain agreements  but not for others 
the following table shows the effect of the above amounts on our premiums ceded for and in millions year ended december premiums ceded  before commutations and estimate changes effect of commutations estimate changes  prior accident years premiums ceded  as adjusted exclusive of the amounts in the preceding paragraphs  our reinsurance expense ratio ceded premiums as a percentage of premiums earned is for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in net investment income  net realized investment gains losses  equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries net investment income in thousands year ended december change net investment income net investment income is primarily derived from the interest income earned by our fixed maturity securities and also includes interest income from short term  trading portfolio and cash equivalent investments  dividend income from equity securities  earnings from other investments and increases in the cash surrender value of business owned executive life insurance contracts 
investment fees and expenses are deducted from investment income 
net investment income by investment category is as follows in thousands year ended december fixed maturities equities short term investments other invested assets business owned life insurance investment expenses net investment income the increase in net investment income from fixed maturities reflects both higher average invested funds and improved yields 
the positive cash flows from our insurance operations and the pra wisconsin merger significantly increased average invested funds during as compared to market interest rates of the past several years allowed us to consistently invest new and matured funds at rates that exceed the average held in our portfolio 
average yields for our available for sale fixed maturity securities during and are as follows year ended december average income yield average tax equivalent income yield the small decline in investment income from short term investments reflects lower average balances in income from other invested assets is principally derived from non public investment partnerships limited liability companies accounted for on a cost basis 
because we recognize income related to these investments as it is distributed to us  our income from these holdings varies from period to period 
business owned life insurance is lower in due to a one time reduction in the growth of cash surrender values due to a restructuring of this portfolio 
equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries is derived from our ownership interests in non public investment entities accounted for on the equity basis 
during two such investment entities reported losses for the year 
our income from these holdings varies from period to period 
in thousands year ended december change equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries net realized investment gains losses the components of net realized investment gains losses are shown in the following table 
in thousands year ended december net gains losses from sales other than temporary impairment losses trading portfolio gains losses net realized investment gains losses during we recognized other than temporary impairment losses of million related to asset backed bonds particularly those with subprime loan exposures 
we also recognized impairments of approximately million related to a passive investment that we hold in a non public investment pool and impairments of  related to corporate bonds that have suffered a significant decline in value 
losses and loss adjustment expenses the determination of calendar year losses involves the actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year and the actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  including an evaluation of the reserve amounts required for losses in excess of policy limits 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies the insured event generally becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with the estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
the following table summarizes calendar year net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
in millions net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december change change current accident year prior accident years calendar year net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
our current accident year loss ratio has increased in as compared to for several reasons 
we have booked higher initial loss ratios in the states in which pra wisconsin operates as we wait for the impact of our post acquisition rate filings in those states to take effect 
the ratio is also impacted by an increase in our estimates for losses in excess of policy limits as compared to the prior year and an increase in the reserve for the death  disability and retirement provision ddr in our claims made policies 
pra wisconsin accounted for approximately million and million of our calendar year net losses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
pra wisconsin is included in our results for all months of our fiscal year as compared to only months during based upon recent claims data  both internal and industry figures  we have reduced our expectation of claims severity 
as a result during calendar year we recognized net favorable development of million generally related to our previously established prior accident year reserves 
in particular we have observed claims severity  within the first million of coverage  for the through accident years below our initial expectations 
given both the long tailed nature of our business and the past volatility of claims  we are generally cautious in recognizing the impact of the underlying trends that lead to the recognition of favorable development 
as we conclude that sufficient data with respect to these trends exists to credibly impact our actuarial analysis we take appropriate actions 
in the case of the claims severity trends for  we believe it is appropriate to recognize the impact of these trends in our actuarial evaluation of prior period loss estimates while also remaining cautious about the past volatility of claims severity 
in our exposures greater than million  which are generally reinsured with third parties  we observed a trend that was somewhat counter to the trend discussed above 
in particular  given the number of large verdicts experienced by the industry we increased our reserves for these exposures resulting in a million increase to gross losses 
the effect of this increase was largely offset by a corresponding increase to the anticipated recoverables from our reinsurers 
our analysis of data indicates increased claims severity and frequency trends related to losses in both categories 
we believe the recognition of these trends represents a cautious approach to what we are observing 
during the year ended december  we recognized net favorable development of million related to our previously established prior accident year reserves  primarily to reflect reductions in our estimates of claim severity  within our retained layer of risk  for the  and accident years 
in  we also recognized a million decrease to gross losses which was offset by a corresponding decrease to the recoverable from our reinsurer 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses in thousands underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting expense ratio year ended december year ended december change change   n a underwriting  operating and acquisition expenses remained fairly flat in as compared to the most significant changes between the two periods are an increase in stock based compensation costs million  a decrease in expenses related to guaranty fund assessments million  and lower acquisition expenses due to the decrease in premiums earned million 
the increase in the underwriting expense ratio is primarily due to the effect of lower premium volume in the pra wisconsin acquisition has little effect on the underwriting expense ratio 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses include stock based compensation expense of approximately million in and million in in  we awarded  vested options to our new ceo 
the options were fully expensed in  which increased underwriting expenses by million and increased the underwriting expense ratio by points 
also  million of stock based compensation expense for relates to awards given to employees who are eligible for retirement as compared to  in awards issued to retirement eligible employees are expensed when granted rather than over the vesting period of the award 
net guaranty fund assessments totaled approximately  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease reflects lower assessments during the year as well as a benefit of approximately  for amounts recouped from our insureds related to assessments from the florida insurance guaranty association  inc guaranty fund 
expenses for the years ended december  and included florida assessments of million and million  respectively 
interest expense approximately  of the increase in interest expense is related to long term debt million assumed in the pra wisconsin merger 
interest expense also increased because our subordinated debentures carry variable rates based on libor and the average libor reset rate for our debt increased an average of approximately half a percentage point in as compared to interest expense by debt obligation is provided in the following table in thousands year ended december change convertible debentures subordinated debentures tps tps debentures surplus notes other taxes our effective tax rate for each period is significantly lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is tax exempt

the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income other effective tax rate item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
certain of the securities are held in an unrealized loss position  we have the current ability and intent to hold such securities until recovery of book value or maturity 
the following table summarizes estimated changes in the fair value of our available for sale and trading fixed maturity securities for specific hypothetical changes in interest rates as of december  in millions  except duration december  december  portfolio change in effective portfolio effective interest rates value value duration value duration basis point rise basis point rise current rate basis point decline basis point decline current rates are as of december  and december  at december   the fair value of our investment in preferred stocks was million  including net unrealized losses of million 
preferred stocks traditionally have been primarily subject to interest rate risk because they bear a fixed rate of return  but may also be subject to credit and equity price risk 
the investments in the above table do not include preferred stocks 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  was on a cost basis which approximated its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant interest rate sensitivity due to its short duration 
credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december   of our fixed maturity securities are rated investment grade as determined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros  eg moody s  standard poor s and fitch 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on our fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  investment grade securities  in spite of their rating  can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
ratings published by the nrsros are one of the tools used to evaluate the credit worthiness of our securities 
the ratings reflect the subjective opinion of the rating agencies as to the credit worthiness of the securities  and therefore  we may be subject to additional credit exposure should the rating prove to be unreliable 
we hold billion of municipal bonds  approximately million of which are insured 
although these bonds may have enhanced credit ratings as a result of guarantees by a monoline insurer  we require the bonds that we purchase to meet our credit criteria on a stand alone basis 
as of december   our municipal bonds have a weighted average rating of aa  even when the benefits of insurance protection are excluded 
even though a number of the monoline insurers have had their ratings downgraded  our municipal bonds continue to be investment grade quality 
equity price risk at december  the fair value of our investment in common stocks was million 
these securities are subject to equity price risk  which is defined as the potential for loss in fair value due to a decline in equity prices 
the weighted average beta of this group of securities is 
beta measures the price sensitivity of an equity security or group of equity securities to a change in the broader equity market  in this case the s p index 
if the value of the s p index increased by  the fair value of these securities would be expected to increase by to million 
conversely  a decrease in the s p index would imply a decrease of in the fair value of these securities to million 
the selected hypothetical changes of plus or minus do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios and are used for illustrative purposes only
