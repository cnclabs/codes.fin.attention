item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion includes forward looking statements about the demand for our products and future results 
please refer to the note regarding forward looking statements section of this annual report on form k 
overview the company has three operating units seismic energy sources  underwater cables and connectors and seismic energy source controllers 
commencing in the fiscal year ending june   each of these operating units is considered to be a separate reportable segment 
prior to fiscal  these operating units were 
table of contents reported in one reportable segment  which was referred to as the oilfield services equipment or geophysical equipment segment 
refer to note to consolidated financial statements for further information on reportable segments 
the company s products in all three segments share a common economic characteristic sales are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity 
during the last half of calendar year  the price of oil significantly decreased and worldwide energy demand decreased due to the global economic slowdown 
these factors lowered the demand for marine seismic exploration surveys 
as a result  the demand for the company s products has decreased 
the company s sales decreased in the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june  longer term  we believe that the fundamentals for the industry remain strong due to the imbalance between supply and demand  low reserve replacement rates and increasing global demand 
as economic conditions improve  we anticipate increased demand for our products in all three segments 
despite the reduction in sales in fiscal as described above  the company s balance sheet continued to strengthen during the fiscal year ended june  cash and short term investments increased from  at june  to  at june   and working capital increased from  at june  to  at june  in addition  during the fiscal year ended june   the company remained debt free 
this balance sheet profile positions the company well to withstand a continued lower level of marine seismic exploration activity and to pursue acquisitions 
effective may   the company sold substantially all of the assets of custom products corporation custom  a wholly owned subsidiary of bolt 
custom  a developer  manufacturer and seller of miniature industrial clutches and brakes and seller of sub fractional horsepower electrical motors  formerly constituted the company s industrial products reportable segment 
in the consolidated financial statements  amounts relating to custom have been reported as discontinued operations in fiscal year and prior fiscal year information relating to custom has been restated as discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company believes that the combination of current cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments and anticipated cash flow from operations in fiscal will be adequate to meet foreseeable operating needs in fiscal in may  the company entered into a  unsecured revolving credit agreement with a bank to support general corporate purposes 
the company did not borrow any funds under the facility and at the request of the company  it was cancelled in march year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments compared to  at june   an increase of  or 
in fiscal  cash flow from continuing operating activities after changes in working capital items was  primarily due to net income  adjusted for depreciation and stock based compensation expense  and lower inventories and partially offset by higher accounts receivable and lower current liabilities 
in fiscal  cash used for investing activities was  of which the company used  to purchase short term investments   for payment under the rts earnout agreement and  for capital expenditures for new and replacement machinery 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal will not exceed  which will be funded from operating cash flow 
these anticipated capital expenditures will relate primarily to new and replacement production machinery 
since a relatively small number of customers account for the majority of the company s sales  the consolidated accounts receivable balance at the end of any period tends to be concentrated in a small number of customers 
at june  and june   the five customers with the highest accounts receivable balances represented  in the aggregate  and  respectively  of the consolidated accounts receivable balances on those dates 

table of contents year ended june  at june   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents 
this amount was  or higher than the amount of cash and cash equivalents at june  in fiscal  cash flow from continuing operating activities after changes in working capital items was  primarily due to net income adjusted for depreciation and stock based compensation expense  partially offset by higher inventories and lower current liabilities 
in fiscal  cash flow from discontinued operating activities after changes in working capital items was  in fiscal  the company used  net of  of cash acquired  for the acquisition of rts and  for capital expenditures relating to continuing operations

results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  consolidated sales for the year ended june  totaled  a decrease of  or compared to the year ended june  this decrease was caused primarily by sales decreases in two reportable segments seismic energy sources and seismic energy source controllers 
a key driver of the consolidated sales decrease was an  decrease in sales of seismic energy source systems 
sales of air gun replacement parts decreased by  and sales of seismic energy source controllers decreased by  sales in the underwater cables and connectors segment  however  increased by  for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  sales of underwater cables and connectors increased in each of the first three quarters of fiscal over the comparable quarter in the prior fiscal year  but decreased in the fourth quarter in line with the sales decreases in the other two reportable segments 
the above sales decreases reflect the reduction in the number of additional seismic vessels placed into service and a slowdown in the level of marine seismic exploration activity in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  the improvement in the gross profit percentage was caused primarily by lower material costs and increased sales prices 
in addition  the gross profit margin in fiscal was affected by lower gross profit associated with certain foreign sales in the seismic energy sources segment  which included sales of auxiliary equipment purchased from outside vendors that normally have a lower margin than the company s proprietary products

the above mentioned factors resulted in net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying the accounting policies most critical to its financial statements have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  the company s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  recording of inventory valuation reserves  deferred taxes  and the potential impairment of goodwill 
these policies are discussed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  including the establishment of bad debt reserves 
the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or are less likely to have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning significant accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes sales revenue when it is realized and earned 
the company s reported sales revenue is based on meeting the following criteria manufacturing products based on customer specifications  delivering product to the customer before the close of the reporting period  whereby delivery results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer  establishing a set sales price with the customer  collecting the sales revenue from the customer is reasonably assured  and no contingencies exist 
inventory valuation reserves a significant source of the company s revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products 
as a result  the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time 
in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or that the company may have supplies in excess of reasonably supportable sales forecasts  an inventory valuation reserve has been established 
the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management based on experience and the exercise of professional judgment 
actual results may differ from this estimate  and the difference could be material 
management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items 
the reserve for inventory valuation at june  and was  and  respectively 
at june  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the raw materials and sub assemblies inventory were considered slow moving and subject to a reserve provision equal to all or a portion of the cost  less an estimate for scrap value 
in certain instances  this inventory has been unsold for more than five years from date of manufacture or purchase  and in other instances the company has more than a five year supply of inventory on hand based on recent sales volume 
at june   the cost of inventory for which the company has more than a five year supply on hand and the cost of inventory for which the company has had no sales during the last five years amounted to approximately  management believes that this inventory is properly valued and appropriately reserved 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a cash outlay since the cash required to manufacture or purchase the older inventory was expended in prior years 
the inventory valuation reserve is adjusted at the close of each accounting period  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the valuation reserve required 
this estimate is calculated on a consistent basis as determined by the company s inventory valuation policy 
increases to the inventory valuation reserve result in a charge to cost of sales  and decreases to the reserve result in a credit to cost of sales 
the inventory valuation reserve is also decreased when items are scrapped or disposed of 
during the fiscal year ended june   the inventory valuation reserve was increased by  and the company did not scrap or dispose of any items 
deferred taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
the company reviews its internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make its assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and june  because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize any deferred tax asset 

table of contents goodwill impairment testing as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
management tested goodwill for impairment and the tests indicated no impairment of the goodwill balances at june  and goodwill represents approximately of the company s total assets at june  and is thus a significant estimate by management 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  it would not result in a cash outlay because the goodwill amounts arose out of acquisition accounting 
see notes  and to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning goodwill 
recent accounting developments subsequent events in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 subsequent events sfas 
sfas establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this disclosure should inform users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the financial statements being presented 
sfas is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june   and is to be applied prospectively 
the company adopted sfas during the quarter ended june  business combinations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r continues to require the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and the identification and recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas r requires  among other things  the buyer to fair value assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date ie  a fair value model rather than a cost allocation model  expense acquisition related costs  recognize assets or liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at acquisition date using acquisition date fair values  recognize goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest over the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired  recognize at acquisition any contingent consideration using acquisition date fair values ie  fair value earn outs in the initial accounting for the acquisition  and eliminate the recognition of liabilities for restructuring costs expected to be incurred as a result of the business combination 
sfas r also defines a bargain purchase as a business combination where the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest 
under this circumstance  the buyer is required to recognize such excess formerly referred to as negative goodwill in earnings as a gain 
in addition  if the buyer determines that some or all of its previously booked deferred tax valuation allowance is no longer needed as a result of the business combination  sfas r requires that the reduction or elimination of the valuation allowance be accounted as a reduction of income tax expense 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company will apply sfas r to any acquisitions that are made on or after july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is not subject to any material market risks associated with activities in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments
