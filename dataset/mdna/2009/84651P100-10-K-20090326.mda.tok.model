com  which targets singles in the united states  blacksingles 
com  which primarily targets black singles in the united states  and christianmingle 
com  which primarily targets christian singles in the united states 
our subscription fees have traditionally been charged on a monthly basis  with discounts for longer term subscriptions 
we have grown both internally and through acquisitions of entities  and selected assets of entities  offering online personals services and related businesses 
through our business acquisitions  we have expanded into new markets  leveraged and enhanced our existing brands to improve our position within new markets  and gained valuable intellectual property 
during the last three years  in addition to a number of small acquisitions  we made the following larger acquisitions on february   we purchased the assets of hurrydate  a leading online personals and singles events company  for total consideration of million  of which million was paid at close in cash 
in addition  subject to certain conditions in the purchase agreement  we would also pay additional consideration based on an earn out tied to the operating income of the hurrydate business for the period covering april  to march  in the second quarter of  we paid the remaining  of the initial cash consideration 
on october   we entered into a letter agreement with the sellers and agreed that the first and second earn out payments would each be  and the third earn out payment would be  these amounts when paid the first installment was paid in and the second installment was paid in the first quarter of would be an increase to the goodwill recorded for this acquisition

table of contents on may   we completed the purchase of certain assets of ldssingles inc  a company that operates a religious online singles community  for million  of which million was paid up front in cash and  was settled in cash  net of liabilities  on the one year anniversary of the acquisition 
our ability to compete effectively will depend on the timely introduction and performance of our future web sites  services and features  the ability to address the needs of our members and paying subscribers and the ability to respond to web sites  services and features introduced by competitors 
to address this challenge  we have invested and will continue to invest existing personnel resources  namely application developers and systems engineers  in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new services  which may include new web sites as well as new features and functions designed to increase the probability of communication among our members and paying subscribers and to enhance their online personals experiences 
we believe we have sufficient cash resources on hand to accomplish the enhancements currently contemplated 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  direct marketing expenses  prepaid advertising  web site and software development costs  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  accounting for business combinations  legal contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions with our board of directors and the board has reviewed these disclosures 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates we used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and deferred revenue substantially all of our revenues are derived from subscription fees 
revenues are presented net of credits and credit card chargebacks 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
recognition occurs ratably over the subscription period  beginning when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred access has been granted  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
paying subscribers primarily pay in advance using a credit card and  subject to certain conditions identified in our terms and conditions  all purchases are final and nonrefundable 
subscription fees collected in advance are deferred and recognized as revenue  using the straight line method  over the term of the subscription 
we reserve for potential credit card chargebacks based on our historical chargeback experience 
direct marketing expenses we incur substantial expenses related to our advertising in order to generate traffic to our web sites 
these advertising costs are primarily online advertising  including affiliate and co brand arrangements  and are directly 
table of contents attributable to the revenues we receive from our subscribers 
we have entered into numerous affiliate arrangements  under which our affiliates advertise or promote our web site  and earn a fee whenever visitors click through the affiliate s advertisement to one of our web sites and register or subscribe on our web site 
we do not typically have any exclusivity arrangements with our affiliates  and some of our affiliates may also be affiliates for our competitors 
under our co branded arrangements  our co brand partners may operate their own separate web sites where visitors can register and subscribe to our web sites 
affiliate deals  co brand deals and online advertising arrangements may fall in the categories of cps  cpa  cpc  or cpm  as discussed below 
our advertising expenses are recognized based on the terms of each individual contract 
the majority of our advertising expenses are based on four pricing models cost per subscription cps where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based upon the number of new paying subscribers it generates  cost per acquisition cpa where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of new member registrations it generates  cost per click cpc where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of clicks to our web sites it generates  and cost per thousand for banner advertising cpm where we pay an online advertising provider a fee based on the number of times it displays our advertisements 
we estimate  in certain circumstances  the total clicks or impressions delivered by our vendors in order to determine amounts due under these contracts 
prepaid advertising expenses in certain circumstances  we pay in advance for internet based advertising on other web sites  and expense the prepaid amounts as direct marketing expenses over the contract periods as the contracted web site delivers on its commitment 
we evaluate the realization of prepaid amounts at each reporting period and expense prepaid amounts if the contracted web site is unable to deliver on its commitment and is not willing or able to repay the undelivered prepaid amounts web site and software development costs we capitalize costs related to developing or obtaining internal use software 
capitalization of costs begins after the preliminary project stage has been completed 
product development costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop requires that costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized 
we exercise judgment in determining which stage of development a software project is in at any point in time 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf accounting for web site development costs  we expense costs related to the planning and post implementation phases of our web site development efforts 
direct costs incurred in the development phase are capitalized 
costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for the web site are included in expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
capitalized web site and software development costs are included in internal use software in property and equipment and amortized over the estimated useful life of the products  which is usually three years 
in accordance with the above accounting literature  we estimate the amount of time spent by our engineers in developing our software and enhancements to our web sites 

table of contents on a regular basis  management reviews the capitalized costs of web sites and software developed to ensure that these costs relate to projects that will be completed and placed in service 
any projects determined not to be viable will be reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
valuation of goodwill  identified intangibles and other long lived assets we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and test property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant decline in actual projected revenue  a significant decline in the market value of our common stock  a significant decline in performance of certain acquired companies relative to our original projections  an excess of our net book value over our market value  a significant decline in our operating results relative to our operating forecasts  a significant change in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decrease in the fair value of an asset  a shift in technology demands and development  and a significant turnover in key management or other personnel 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in the case of the other intangible assets and other long lived assets  this measurement is only performed if the projected undiscounted cash flows for the asset are less than its carrying value 
in we completed our required annual valuation of our intangible assets and found the hurrydate goodwill to be impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million also in we were capitalizing costs related to a website which we planned to develop 
we decided that we would not continue the development in the same manner and as such we impaired the  which had been capitalized up to that point 
in the first quarter of  we undertook certain marketing initiatives designed to reverse the decline in revenues for our americansingles web site 
while partially successful  the initiatives at that time did not increase new subscriber additions to the point that subscriber levels stabilized  and management determined that the spending required for the marketing initiatives was not sustainable and thus they were terminated 
an analysis of the expected cash flows from the web site after the first quarter initiatives were terminated resulted in expectations of future profitability for the site that were insufficient to sustain the carrying value of goodwill on the company s balance sheet 
accordingly  the company recorded a million impairment expense related to the removal of the book carrying value of goodwill under sfas related to americansingles in the first quarter of accounting for business combinations we have acquired the stock or specific assets of a number of companies from through some of which were considered to be business acquisitions 
under the purchase method of accounting  the cost  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

table of contents the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful life assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income 
different classes of assets will have varying useful lives 
for example  the useful life of a member database  which is typically three years  is not the same as the useful life of a paying subscriber list  which is typically three months  or a domain name  which is indefinite 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  there may be less amortization recorded in a given period or no amortization for indefinite lived intangibles 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the value of our intangible and other long lived assets  including goodwill  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends or if future performance is below historical trends 
we review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
we continually review the events and circumstances related to our financial performance and economic environment for factors that would provide evidence of the impairment of goodwill  identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets 
we used the equity method of accounting for our investment in affiliates over which we exert significant influence 
significant influence is generally having between a to ownership interest 
at december   we owned a interest in playahead duplo ab which we accounted for using the equity method 
on october   the company sold all its shares in playahead ab for million in cash and recognized a gain of approximately  legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in the notes to the financial statements and under business legal proceedings 
to the extent that a loss related to a contingency is reasonably estimable and probable  we accrue an estimate of that loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on certain pending litigation  we may be unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome of such litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and make or  if necessary  revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of the assets and liabilities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in the fourth quarter of  we analyzed our past performance as well as other factors and concluded that all of the net operating losses incurred by the company would more likely than not be used to offset future income and the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was released 
at december   we had gross net operating loss nol carry forwards for income tax purposes of approximately million and million available to reduce future federal and state taxable income  respectively  which expire beginning in the years for federal purposes and for state purposes 
under section of the internal revenue code  the utilization of the net operating loss carry forwards can be limited based on changes in the percentage ownership of the company 

table of contents of the nols available  approximately million for federal purposes are attributable to losses incurred by an acquired subsidiary 
such losses are subject to other restrictions on usage including the requirement that they are only available to offset future income of the subsidiary 
in addition  the available nols do not include any amounts generated by the acquired subsidiary prior to the acquisition date due to substantial uncertainty regarding the company s ability to realize the benefit in the future 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r the company will recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for nol carry forwards resulting from excess tax benefits 
as of december   deferred tax assets do not include approximately million of these excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of the company s nol carry forwards 
additional paid in capital will be increased up to an additional million if and when such excess tax benefits are realized 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r in using the modified prospective approach and accordingly periods prior to have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
prior to our adoption of statement r  we did not record tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of our deferred tax assets in future tax returns 
statement r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
in and  we recognized cash inflows of approximately million and cash outflows of approximately  respectively related to tax provision or benefit from stock based compensation 
we calculate the fair value of stock options by using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected dividend yield and the expected stock option exercise behavior 
additionally  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we used historical and empirical data to assess different forfeiture rates for three different groups of employees 
we must reassess forfeiture rates when deemed necessary and we must calibrate actual forfeiture behavior to what has already been recorded 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility 
the volatility rate was derived by examining historical stock price behavior and assessing management s expectations of stock price behavior during the term of the option 
the term of the options was derived based on the simplified method calculations as described in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
we are using the simplified method calculation  which is derived by averaging the vesting term with the contractual terms due to a change in the stock exchange on which the company s stock was traded 
we do not believe exercise behavior and expected term are consistent across the different stock exchanges 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we believe the accounting for stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy because it requires the use of complex judgment in its application 
segment reporting during the third quarter  we changed our financial reporting to include data on four newly defined operating segments jewish networks  which consists of jdate

the change  in compliance with financial accounting standard no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  is a result of the change to the company s overall revenue mix and how management reviews information to assess financial performance

our general market networks segment operates in a much more competitive environment  and therefore we generally must spend more on marketing to attract new subscribers 
we are constantly striving to improve our web sites to retain our existing subscribers

using the non gaap measure limits the users ability to judge true expenses of our company in the current period 
however  traditionally investors and analysts using financial information discount gaap operating results to provide a better picture of the cash generating potential of a company 
to avoid the limitation  management provides the gaap measure in all of its financial information other than the information listed in the chart above 
we believe that the non gaap measure provides useful information to management and investors regarding how the expenses associated 
table of contents with the application of sfas r are reflected on the statements of operations and facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results 
our management uses this information internally for reviewing the financial results  forecasting and budgeting 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  impairment of long lived assets  non cash currency translation adjustments for inter company loans and scheme of arrangement costs 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as a substitute for net income loss or net cash provided by used in operating activities all as determined in accordance with gaap for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance  financial position and cash flows  as adjusted ebitda is not defined by gaap 
however  the company regards adjusted ebitda as a complement to net income and other gaap financial performance measures  including an indirect measure of operating cash flow 
as such  management believes that the investment community finds it to be a useful tool to perform meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core on going operations

table of contents orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  sfas establishes a three tier value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value level observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace 
level unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity 
the fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value
