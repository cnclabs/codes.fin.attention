the factors listed in item a risk factors  as well as any cautionary language in this form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected

overview we are a development stage medical device company focused on the design and development of devices that use neuroblocking technology to treat obesity  its associated co morbidities  and other gastrointestinal disorders 
our proprietary neuroblocking technology  which we refer to as vbloc therapy  is designed to intermittently block the vagus nerve using high frequency  low energy  electrical impulses 
we have a limited operating history and we currently have no products approved for sale 
our initial product under development is the maestro system  which uses vbloc therapy to limit the expansion of the stomach  help control hunger sensations between meals  reduce the frequency and intensity of stomach contractions and produce a feeling of early and prolonged fullness 
we were formerly known as beta medical  inc and were incorporated in minnesota on december  we later changed our state of incorporation to delaware on july  since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of our maestro system 
based on our understanding of vagal nerve function and nerve blocking from our preclinical studies and the results of our initial clinical trials  we believe the maestro system may offer obese patients a minimally invasive treatment alternative that has the potential to result in significant and sustained weight loss 
we believe that our maestro system will allow bariatric surgeons to help obese patients who are concerned about the risks and complications associated with gastric banding and gastric bypass surgery 
we are continuing to evaluate the maestro system in human clinical trials conducted internationally 
preliminary results from a feasibility study conducted outside the us  indicates that the maestro system may provide durable and ongoing weight loss for people with obesity 
as of january   the most recent follow up of nine rf patients  among the earliest patients implanted in the vbloc rf trial  showed an excess weight loss ewl of at months of vbloc therapy 
at that time  the most recent results for the prior follow up periods demonstrated an ewl of in rf patients at months and an ewl of in rf patients at six months of vbloc therapy 
we have completed enrollment and implantation of subjects in our first us pivotal trial  the empower trial 
we plan to review the data from our empower trial to support our premarket approval pma application in late and submit the application for the maestro system shortly thereafter 
we anticipate commercialization in the united states beginning in early if and when the fda grants us approval 
in addition  data from sub group analyses demonstrate that vbloc therapy may hold promise in improving the co morbidities of diabetes and hypertension  independent of  and prior to  substantial weight loss 
we are conducting  or plan to conduct  feasibility studies in each of these co morbidities to assess vbloc therapy s potential in addressing multiple indications 
if and when we obtain fda approval of our maestro system we intend to market our products in the united states through a direct sales force supported by field technical and marketing managers who provide training  technical and other support services to our customers 
outside the united states we intend to use direct  dealer and distributor sales models as the targeted geography best dictates 
to date  we have relied on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of our maestro system 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to rely on third party manufacturers and suppliers for the production of the maestro system following commercialization 

table of contents to date  we have generated no revenue from the sale of products  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
we expect our losses to continue and to increase as we continue our development activities and expand our commercialization activities 
we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placement of our equity securities and issuance of debt 
recent events on february   we entered into several securities purchase agreements for the sale of  shares of our common stock  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  in a private placement transaction with several accredited investors the private placement 
the purchase price per share was  which equaled the consolidated closing bid price of our common stock as reported by the nasdaq stock market on february  the warrants will be exercisable at any time and from time to time beginning on the date that is six months and one day after the closing of the private placement and ending four years after the closing of the private placement 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  which equals of the consolidated closing bid price of our common stock as reported by the nasdaq stock market on february  on february   we completed the final closing of the private placement receiving gross proceeds of million  less a placement agent fee of  and certain other expenses 
in addition  the placement agent received a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock in the same form as that issued to participants in the private placement 
we obtained ce marking approval for sale of the maestro system on march  the method of assessing conformity with applicable regulatory requirements varies depending on the class of the device  but for our maestro system which falls into class iii  the method involved a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer of the safety and performance of the device  and a third party assessment by a notified body  usually of the design of the device and of the manufacturer s quality system 
we used kema in the netherlands as the notified body for our ce marking approval process 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
stock based compensation through december   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  including the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
for periods prior to december   we complied with the disclosure only provisions required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to sfas 
table of contents under apb  we were not required to recognize stock based compensation expense for employee stock options granted from inception through as the exercise prices  for financial reporting purposes  were determined to be at or above the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of our common stock was assessed and approved by our board of directors  the members of which have extensive experience in the life sciences industry and all but one of whom are nonemployee directors 
in determining the appropriateness of the fair value of our common stock  the board of directors considered several factors  such as our life cycle  results of research and development  recent financings and financial projections 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which requires compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to december  calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  which represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
estimates of stock based compensation expenses are significant to our consolidated financial statements  but these expenses are based on the black scholes pricing model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
the guidance in sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
the provisions of sfas r are applied to all share based payment awards issued to employees and where appropriate  nonemployees  unless another source of literature applies 
when determining the measurement date of a nonemployee s share based payment award  we follow emerging issues task force abstract no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  which requires measuring the stock options at fair value and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
for stock options granted to nonemployees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant and each subsequent reporting period until the services are completed or a significant disincentive for nonperformance occurs  we make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
different estimates of volatility and expected life of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire in varying amounts from through  if not utilized 
under the provisions of sections and of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax credits that can be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
a valuation allowance has been established to reserve the potential benefits of these carryforwards and tax credits in our consolidated financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of future taxable income required to utilize available tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
if a change in our ownership is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits in any fiscal year may be significantly limited 

table of contents financial overview revenue to date  we have not commercialized any products and we have not generated any revenue 
we do not expect to generate revenue until early and then  only if we receive fda approval of our maestro system 
any revenue from initial sales of a new product is difficult to predict and in any event will only modestly reduce our continued and increasing losses resulting from our research and development and other activities 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering  product development and clinical and regulatory expenses  incurred in the development of our maestro system 
research and development expenses also include employee compensation  including stock based compensation  consulting services  outside services  materials  supplies  depreciation and travel 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
from inception through december   we have incurred a total of million in research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for executive  finance  market development and administrative personnel  including stock based compensation 
other significant expenses include costs associated with attending medical conferences  professional fees for legal  including legal services associated with our efforts to obtain and maintain broad protection for the intellectual property related to our products  and accounting services  cash management fees  consulting fees and travel expenses 
from inception through december   we have incurred million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to a million increase in compensation expenses associated with increased headcount to support the empower trial and a million increase in professional services primarily due to empower patient recruiting and payments to the empower clinical study sites  partially offset by product development and research reductions for contractor separations upon completion of the maestro rc system  contractor conversions and pre clinical animal study reductions 
included in research and development expenses during were  of stock based compensation charges compared to million in the million decrease in stock based compensation is primarily the result of a million one time expense for the issuance of  shares of common stock to the mayo foundation for medical education and research upon the completion of our initial public offering ipo in november  partially offset by increases from additional employee options granted during with a higher weighted average option price and fair value 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to increases of  in compensation expense from increased headcount and  in professional services  including legal expenses  travel and insurance  all driven by the new requirements of being a publicly traded company 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses during were million of stock based compensation charges compared to million in stock based compensation expense increased  due to a million increase resulting from additional employee options granted during with a higher weighted average option price and fair value offset by a million reduction due to an increased number of nonemployee options becoming fully vested during 
table of contents interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of  or  is primarily due to a decrease in the short term interest rate environment despite an increase in the average cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balance from million during to million during the increased average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance is the result of the net million raised in our ipo in november  million of debt funding received in and million of debt funding received in november  of which we received net proceeds of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily the result of entering into a million debt facility  of which million was funded in november that resulted in net proceeds of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off 
the existing debt pay off resulted in a one time interest payment of  and the acceleration of  in unamortized discounts on notes payable 
change in value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability 
change in value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability was for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the preferred stock warrant liability was recorded on december  when we sold an additional  shares of series c preferred stock 
upon closing of the sale  we had insufficient authorized and unissued shares of series c preferred stock available to share settle outstanding warrants to purchase series c preferred stock  resulting in the warrants being reclassified as a liability at the estimated fair value of  on december  on may  we filed an amended certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of series c preferred stock to  as a result of the amendment  we had sufficient authorized and unissued shares of series c preferred stock available to share settle the warrants 
the fair market value of the warrants on may  was determined to be million 
the  change in fair value from december  to the amendment date was recorded as expense and the convertible preferred stock liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
comparison of the years ended december  and research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to a million increase in compensation expenses associated with increased headcount to support the empower clinical study and a million increase in professional services primarily associated with additional resources needed to complete development of the maestro rc system 
supplies and other information technology expenses increased million due to empower clinical start up expenses 
included in research and development expenses during were million of stock based compensation charges compared to  in the increase of million is the result of adopting the prospective method prescribed in sfas r and an increase in the estimated fair value of our common stock from january  through december  the increase in stock based compensation is also the result of a million one time expense for the issuance of  shares of common stock to the mayo foundation for medical education and research upon the completion of our ipo in november selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  is primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation as a result of adopting the prospective method prescribed in sfas r  an increase in the number of options granted  additional vesting of options and an increase in the fair value of our common stock from january  through december  additional components of the increase include a  increase in compensation expense associated with increased headcount and a  increase in professional services 
the increase in professional services is related to patent filing fees and general patent support  audit fees associated with our initial public offering  public relations and reimbursement activities and employee recruiting fees 

table of contents interest income 
interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of  was primarily due to higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as a result of the closing of our million series c preferred stock financing in the second half of  debt funding throughout  and to a lesser extent  the proceeds from our ipo 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  was primarily due to borrowings under the new loan agreements entered into during and the associated debt commitment fees 
change in value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability 
change in value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the preferred stock warrant liability was recorded on december  when we sold an additional  shares of series c preferred stock 
upon closing of the sale  we had insufficient authorized and unissued shares of series c preferred stock available to share settle outstanding warrants to purchase series c preferred stock  resulting in the warrants being reclassified as a liability at the estimated fair value of  on december  the warrants were subsequently re measured as of december  on may  we filed an amended certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of series c preferred stock to  as a result of the amendment  we had sufficient authorized and unissued shares of series c preferred stock available to share settle the warrants 
the fair market value of the warrants on may  was determined to be million 
the  change in fair value from december  to the amendment date was recorded as expense and the convertible preferred stock liability was reclassified to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses since our inception in december and  as of december  we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
we have financed our operations to date principally through the sale of capital stock  debt financing and interest earned on investments 
prior to our ipo in november  we had received net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and preferred stock and million in debt financing   to finance equipment purchases and million to finance working capital 
through our initial public offering we received net proceeds of million after expenses and underwriters discounts and commissions and including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
in november  we entered into a million working capital debt facility  replacing the existing debt financing 
we received net proceeds of million from the first draw of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
of this amount million was invested in short term money market funds that are not considered to be bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance company or other government agency 
these money market funds seek to preserve the value of the investment at per share  however  it is possible to lose money investing in these funds 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  us corporate bonds  commercial paper  asset backed securities and money market funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy  primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
at times  such deposits may be in excess of insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of our short term investment holdings are based on security prices from one or multiple industries established pricing sources 
examples of these pricing sources are bloomberg  interactive data corporation  reuters  jj kenny  and merrill lynch 
each pricing source uses a different confidential method for pricing securities using various inputs  such as interest rates  known historical trades  yield curve information  benchmark data  prepayment speeds  credit quality  or broker dealer quotes 
management regularly reviews the 
table of contents pricing methodology used by our third party asset managers to ensure consistency of the fair value determination with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  and proper classification of the underlying assets and liabilities within that standard s fair value hierarchy 
we also review each of our short term investment positions and assess whether there is any other than temporary impairment as well as the reasonableness of the fair market values being reported 
based on our review of short term investments held at december   there were no indicators of other than temporary impairment present 
the remaining unpaid balance of the million in debt financing as of december  is collateralized by a first security priority lien on all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
we have entered into account control agreements in order to perfect the lender s first security interest in our cash and investment accounts 
in the event we have less than five remaining months of liquidity  we are required to grant a temporary lien on our intellectual property 
the number of remaining months of liquidity is calculated by dividing cash and cash equivalents as of the end of any particular month by the sum of our total operating expenses for each of the immediately preceding five months 
the debt financing agreement also requires us to maintain a cash and cash equivalents balance that exceeds the outstanding principal balance until we receive ce mark approval and raise aggregate net proceeds of at least million from new capital transactions and secure aggregate net proceeds of at least million by january  from new capital transactions  of which million is required by june  on february   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock  together with warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  in a private placement transaction with several accredited investors 
we received gross proceeds of million less a placement agent fee of  and certain other expenses 
under the terms of our debt financing agreement  as a result of completing the private placement transaction on february  and obtaining ce mark approval on march  our liquidity covenant has changed requiring us to maintain a cash and cash equivalents balance that exceeds our aggregate operating expenses for the most recent five calendar month period ending prior to the determination date 
the date by which we are required to secure the remaining aggregate net proceeds under the capital covenant may be extended upon the achievement of certain milestones defined in the debt financing agreement 
there are no additional liquidity covenants that we are required to maintain under the terms of our debt financing agreements 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities primarily reflects the net loss for those periods  which was partially offset by depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by or used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities for the years ended december  and was primarily related to the proceeds from the maturity of short term investments partially offset by the purchase of short term investments and  to a lesser extent  the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily related to the purchase of short term investments and  to a lesser extent  purchase of property and equipment offset somewhat by the proceeds from the maturity of short term investments 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from debt financing in each of the three years ended december   and  
table of contents the issuance of common shares in our initial public offering in the year ended december  and the issuance of series c preferred stock in the year ended december  on november  we entered into a million debt facility 
the initial commitment under the debt facility was for million and was funded on november   of which we received net proceeds of million after transaction expenses  facility charges and existing debt pay off 
the million loan requires monthly interest only payments through june  at an annual percentage rate of followed by equal principal and interest installments beginning july  at an annual percentage rate of 
a final payment fee of  is due december   the maturity date 
a second draw of million is available and automatically funded under the terms of the loan agreement if the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market meets or exceeds a target amount on or before june  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have not commercialized any products and we have not earned any operating revenues 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we develop our products  prepare for the potential commercial launch of our maestro system  develop the corporate infrastructure required to sell our products  operate as a publicly traded company and pursue additional applications for our technology platform 
we do not expect to generate any product revenue until early we do not anticipate generating any product revenue in the united states unless and until we successfully obtain fda approval for our maestro system 
we believe the net proceeds from our initial public offering in november  the credit facility entered into november and the private placement closed february   together with our pre existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and interest income we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through if our available cash  cash equivalents and investment balances are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay  or eliminate some or all of  our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could materially harm our business 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  the costs to complete development of products and the cost to commercialize our products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices  such as our maestro system  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of the products and successfully deliver a commercial product to the market 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following the scope  rate of progress  results and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  
table of contents the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our maestro system and any products that we may develop  the rate of market acceptance of our maestro system and vbloc therapy and any other product candidates  the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights  the cost of defending  in litigation or otherwise  any claims that we infringe third party patent or other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing products and market developments  the cost of explanting clinical devices  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  any revenue generated by sales of our future products  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our financial condition and liquidity position in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease long term debt  including interest other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations the table above reflects only payment obligations that are fixed and determinable 
our operating lease commitments relate to our corporate headquarters in st 
paul  minnesota 
other long term liabilities consist of obligations required under the terms of our license agreements with the mayo foundation for medical education and research mayo foundation 
under the terms of our license agreement  the mayo foundation receives an annual  retainer fee which commenced in and continues through january we may also be obligated to pay the mayo foundation  contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events  earned royalty payments  including a minimum annual royalty as defined by the agreement  for the commercial sale of products developed and patented by the mayo foundation  jointly patented by the company and the mayo foundation  or a product where the mayo foundation provided know how as defined by the agreement 
if no products are patented  the minimum royalty is not due 
while we have licensed in two obesity related patent applications from mayo clinic  none of these patents cover medical technology relating to our vbloc technology 
in december  we entered into a second research and development agreement with the mayo foundation 
in accordance with the three year agreement  the mayo foundation receives an annual  retainer fee 
we may also be obligated to pay the mayo foundation  contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events as defined by the agreement  consideration with respect to licensed know how regarding product development and testing of products and rights to licensed patents  where the mayo foundation provided know how as defined by the agreement 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements since our inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities as defined by rules enacted by the securities and exchange commission and financial accounting standards board  and accordingly  no such arrangements are likely to have a current or future effect on our financial position  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas was effective for us starting in fiscal with respect to financial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb released a fasb staff position fas effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements see note of our consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the amendment to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with investments in available for sale or trading securities 
sfas was effective for us starting on january   however  no assets or liabilities have currently been remeasured at fair value 
in may  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states for non governmental entities 
sfas is effective days following approval by the sec of the public company accounting oversight board s amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued emerging issues task force no 
eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
eitf requires entities to evaluate whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock by assessing the instrument s contingent exercise provisions and settlement provisions 
instruments not indexed to their own stock fail to meet the scope exception of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  paragraph a  and should be classified as a liability and marked to market 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is to be applied to outstanding instruments upon adoption with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we have assessed our outstanding equity linked financial instruments and have concluded that effective january  we will need to reclassify warrants issued november and with a recorded value of million on december  from equity to a liability 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on january  was a  increase to the deficit accumulated during development stage 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as either available for sale or held to maturity and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our cash equivalents and investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
