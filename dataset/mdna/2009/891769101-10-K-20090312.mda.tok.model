item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowings  the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
we rely on commercial and retail deposits  brokered deposits  advances from the federal home loan bank and other borrowings to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if  among other things  our results of operations or financial condition or market conditions were to change 
in addition  if we fall below the fdic s thresholds to be considered well capitalized  we will be unable to continue with uninterrupted access to the brokered funds markets 
although we consider these sources of funds adequate for our liquidity needs  there can be no assurance in this regard  and we may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
there can be no assurance additional borrowings  if sought  would be available to us or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
bank and holding company stock prices have been negatively affected by the recent adverse economic trend  as has the ability of banks and holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms  our financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we actively monitor the depository institutions that hold our federal funds sold and due from banks cash balances 
we are currently not able to provide assurances that access to our cash equivalents and federal funds sold will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and we diversify our due from banks and federal funds sold among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities 
the financials of the counterparties are routinely reviewed as part of our asset liability management process 
balances in our accounts with financial institutions in the us may exceed the fdic insurance limits 
while we monitor and adjust the balances in our accounts as appropriate  these balances could be impacted if the financial institutions fail and could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
changes in market interest rates have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense that we may pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
our interest bearing assets generally reprice or mature more quickly than our interest earning liabilities 
prior to june   interest rates had been at historically low levels 
subsequent to that date  the us federal reserve began to increase its target federal funds rate from a low to a high of in june of it remained at through september of  at which time the federal reserve began to again lower the federal funds rate  which stood at as of december  in  the federal funds rate continued to decrease to a low of to at december  in a rising interest rate environment  our net interest margin can be adversely impacted to the extent that our fixed rate loans do not reprice or approximately of our loans as of december  
in such case  rates paid on non term deposit accounts will rise  thus also decreasing our margin 
additionally  deposit customers may move funds from savings accounts to higher rate certificate of deposit accounts 
in a falling interest rate environment  however  our net interest margin could likewise be negatively affected  as competitive pressures might require us to decrease our lending interest rates  while these same competitive pressures could keep us from further reducing interest payment rates on our deposits 
such movements  therefore  could cause a decrease in our interest rate spread and net interest margin 
we are also subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and mortgage related securities 
decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities  as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowing costs 
under these circumstances  we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest on our existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
changes in interest rates also affect the value of our interest earning assets and  in particular  our securities portfolio held for investment 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale  therefore  could have an adverse effect on shareholders equity 
our loan growth has historically outpaced our ability to generate lower cost in market deposits  and this has required us to find alternative funding sources  which to the extent thereof adversely affects our net interest margin 
our loan growth has historically outpaced our ability to fund that loan growth with in market deposits  and accordingly  we have been required to go to alternative funding sources  such as out of market deposits  typically certificates of deposit purchased from brokers  borrowings from the federal home loan bank  and or from the issuance of trust preferred securities 
however  in  we purposefully allowed our loan portfolio to decrease to be able to focus on improving asset quality  increasing liquidity  and improving profitability 
this decrease in the loan portfolio allowed us to be less dependent on in market and out of market deposits for funding 
typically  our interest margins are adversely affected to the extent that we must access such alternative funding sources 
due to significant decreases in interest rates toward the end of  we found it more advantageous to increase our borrowings from the fhlb and out of market deposits for funding of loans and investments than to increase our in market deposits at competitive rates at the end of december 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will continue to be able to do this under current market conditions 
concern of customers over deposit insurance may cause a decrease in deposits with recent increased concerns about bank failures  customers may be concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the fdic 
customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with their bank is fully insured 
decreases in such deposits may adversely affect our funding costs and net income 
our deposit insurance premium could be substantially higher in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  such as the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund at a certain level 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures and expectations for further failures  in which case the fdic ensures payments of deposits up to insured limits from the deposit insurance fund 
on october   the fdic published a restoration plan designed to replenish the deposit insurance fund over a period of five years and to increase the deposit insurance reserve ratio  which decreased to of insured deposits on june   to the statutory minimum of of insured deposits by december  in order to implement the restoration plan  the fdic proposes to change both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates 
commencing with the first quarter of  our fdic deposit assessment rates increased by seventy percent to an annualized level of  compared to  for technological advances may adversely impact tower financial corporation s business 
the banking industry is undergoing technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving customer services  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to does to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or successfully market such products and services to our customers 
a breach of information security or a breakdown in our data storage and distribution systems could adversely affect our earnings 
increasingly  we depend upon data processing  communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks  and over the internet 
we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or that they may not from time to time malfunction  due either to human error or mechanical failure  despite safeguards we have instituted 
in addition  we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs 
if information security is breached  information can be lost or misappropriated  resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others 
these costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage  if any  which could adversely affect our earnings 
strong competition within the bank s market area has hurt and could continue to hurt our profits and slow our growth 
competition in our banking and financial services competitive market area  both in making loans and in attracting deposits  is intense  and our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in both arenas 
we compete in allen county and warsaw  indiana  our primary market areas  with numerous commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms 
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technology changes and continued consolidation 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things our ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets 
our ability to maintain and expand our market position 
the scope  relevance and pricing of our products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands 
the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors 
customer satisfaction with our level of service 
industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in the bank earning less on loans and paying more for deposits  which would reduce net interest income and aversely affect our results 
competition also may make it more difficult to attract deposits and  consequently  to grow loans 
our continuing concentration of loans in our primary allen county and warsaw  indiana market areas may increase our risk 
our success depends primarily on the general economic condition within the metropolitan fort wayne  allen county  and warsaw  indiana market areas in which we conduct our business 
unlike large banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in our market area 
local economic conditions in our market areas therefore have a significant impact on our loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by the loss of manufacturing and other jobs  unemployment or other factors beyond our control  which affects local economic conditions  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because we have a significant amount of commercial real estate development and construction loans  decreases in housing demand brought about by a loss of jobs  an increase in homes available for sale on the market and a reduction in demand for new housing may also have a negative affect on the ability of some of our borrowers to make timely repayment of their loans  which could have an adverse impact on our earnings 
in we have continued to see a significant slow down in home sales in the fort wayne and allen county  indiana market  and this will continue into most of home prices for the median priced homes remains consistent  with only pockets of value declines 
allen county and the majority of indiana are not defined as declining markets 
in response to the slow down in sales and the domino effects of that slow down  we have increased oversight surrounding local development and construction loans and have also expanded our construction market area to decrease our dependence on the activity within allen county 
we face risks entering new markets or establishing new branches 
there are substantial costs associated with opening a banking facility  including the cost of construction  land purchases if owned or lease commitments if leased  equipping the facility  staffing commitments and marketing costs 
if we are not successful in establishing a customer base and conditions that enable us to profitably operate that facility  we may be forced to either sustain continuing losses or to close the facility 
we opened our second full service branch outside of allen county  indiana in we chose warsaw  indiana  which is located approximately miles northwest of fort wayne  indiana 
there are several banks that have already established themselves in that market and have been there for many years 
our ability to compete in the market and realize an appropriate return to shareholders depends on the local economy and how the consumers react to our brand 
competition for loans and deposits may have adverse affects on our net interest income as well 
on the other hand  during we closed our banking facility in angola  indiana  another nearby community  which we opened in august that facility failed to achieve our profitability requirements 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the indiana department of financial institutions  our chartering authority  by the federal deposit insurance corporation  as insurer of our deposits  by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  as regulator of our bank and holding company and by the us congress or the indiana general assembly 
such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which a banking institution and its holding company may engage  and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
we are subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny with respect to bank secrecy and anti money laundering statutes and regulations 
recently  regulators have intensified their focus on the usa patriot act s anti money laundering and bank secrecy act compliance requirements 
there is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the office of foreign assets control 
in order to comply with regulations  guidelines and examination procedures in this area  we are required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems 
we cannot be certain that the policies  procedures and systems we have in place or may in the future put in place are or will be flawless 
therefore  there is no assurance that in every instance we are and will be in full compliance with these requirements 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiary for most of our revenue because we are a holding company with no significant assets other than the bank and the trust company  we typically depend upon dividends from one or both of these entities for a substantial portion of our revenues 
while the bank did not pay dividends to the holding company in or  the trust company paid a dividend in the amount of  to the holding company in our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders will therefore continue to depend in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the bank 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to the restrictions of the indiana business corporation law 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to the holding company is also subject to the regulatory authority of the federal reserve board and the indiana department of financial institutions dfi 
additionally  through a resolution passed by the board of directors in january  tower financial corporation and tower bank are required to receive written approval by the federal reserve bank of chicago prior to issuing any dividends 
from time to time  we may also become a party to financing agreements or other contractual arrangements that may have the effect of limiting or prohibiting us or our bank subsidiary from declaring or paying dividends 
our holding company expenses and interest obligations on our trust preferred securities and corresponding subordinated debt securities issued by us may limit or impair our ability to declare or pay dividends 
tower financial corporation depends heavily on its key banking and management personnel 
tower financial corporation s success depends in part on its ability to attract and retain key executives and to attract and retain qualified and productive banking officers  who have experience both in sophisticated banking matters and in operating small to mid size banks 
these qualities are essential both for effective executive management and also for the growth and expansion of the bank s customer base for loans and deposits 
competition for such personnel is strong in the local banking industry  and we compete with many other banks and financial institutions  some of them with financial resources and benefits greater than ours  for such individuals 
in this market environment  we may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel we require for future growth 
tower financial corporation expects to effectively compete in this area by offering financial packages that include incentive based compensation and the opportunity to join in the rewarding work of building a growing bank 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition

introduction the following discussion presents management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the company as of december  and and for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
forward looking statements this report includes forward looking statements 
all statements regarding the company s anticipated results or expectations  including its business plan and strategies are intended to be forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of typically  forward looking statements are predictive and are not statements of historical fact  and the words anticipates  believes  estimates  seeks  expects  plans  intends  and similar expressions  as they relate to us  the bank  the trust company  or our management  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable and have based these expectations on our beliefs as well as assumptions we have made  these expectations may prove to be incorrect 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations include  without limitation  the following our dependence on a favorable local economy in the bank s primary service area  the effect of general economic and monetary conditions on the bank s ability to attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads  the risk of losses due to loan defaults by both commercial loan customers or a significant number of other borrowers  general changes in real estate  business and general property valuations underlying secured loans  the effect of banking regulation on the bank s ability to grow and compete  restrictions imposed on us by regulators  and our dependence on key banking and management personnel 
please also refer to the risk factors section of this report for a discussion of some of the principal risks and uncertainties inherent in our business 
executive overview net income for was million compared to a net loss of million in the increase in earnings from to was primarily due to a decrease in the amount of provision expense of million recorded in compared to the previous year 
net interest income decreased from to  along with a decrease in net interest margin from to 
net interest income decreased due to a decrease in net interest margin  a purposeful decrease in total loans  and the continuance of elevated levels of nonperforming assets 
net interest margin decreased in primarily due to a basis point decrease in short term interest rates throughout the year 
non interest income increased by from to  with an increase of  or  in trust and brokerage fees and an increase of  or  in service charges 
the wealth management segment has continued to show strong revenue growth and asset growth for the th consecutive year 
the gain on the sale of investments increased in by  from a loss of  in operating expenses increased by  or from to the increase was due to an increase in fdic insurance premiums of  or due to the need to replenish the fund that was depleted by several large financial institutions failing in the fdic also saw a need to increase the premiums due to the expectation of future bank failures  increasing the insured limit to  on interest bearing deposits and unlimited for non interest bearing deposits  and the additional operating expenses that will be incurred with the increased resolution activity 
data processing expenses increased by  or due to cost associated with our on line banking conversion and upgrade 
legal and professional expenses also increased due to the outsourcing of our internal audit and loan review functions  along with increased costs associated with the workout of non performing assets 
the increases in operating expenses were offset by a decrease in employment expenses by  due to a workforce reduction that took place in april total assets decreased by million or from the prior year 
the purposeful decrease in loans of million and an increase in the allowance for loan loss of million was the primary reason for the decrease in total assets and was offset by an increase in investments of million 
asset quality and liquidity continues to be a major focus of the bank  in the wake of the substantial charge offs and the significant increase in non performing assets the bank sustained during core deposits grew million and now comprise over of total deposits  compared to approximately in the prior year 
while our cost of funds decreased in due to the growth in core deposits  net interest margin continued to decrease due to the significant decrease of basis points in short term interest rates 
in a decreasing rate environment  deposits do not reprice as quickly as loans  so the lag causes a compression in the interest margin directly impacting net interest income as it did in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any loan charged off 
we have an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has two components identified specific allocations and a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  we combine estimated allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watchlist reporting 
specific allocations of allowance for loan losses are determined for each identified credit based on delinquency rates  collateral and other risk factors identified for that credit 
second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of our borrowers  industry concentrations within the loan portfolio and general economic conditions 
absent the availability of some of these factors  we base our estimates upon peer industry data of comparable banks 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that under normal circumstances should adequately cover probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that a loan or a portion thereof is uncollectible 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower s operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting judgment calls relating to allowances for loan losses 
some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although we believe our process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
results of operations summary 
we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  this reflects an increase of million from a net loss of million in and a decrease of million from net income of million posted in net income per diluted share of reflects a increase from the net loss reported in and a decrease from the net income posted in the results reflected a million growth in net income compared to a net loss of million in net interest income decreased by  or  due to a drop in interest margin throughout the year  elevated levels of non performing assets  and a purposeful decrease in total loans 
net interest margin decreased due to the reduction in interest rates throughout noninterest income increased by  or  primarily due to increases of  and  in trust and brokerage fees and service charges  respectively 
provision expense decreased significantly in by million compared to due to lower loan charge offs and less deterioration of asset quality issues 
noninterest expense increased by  due to an increase in data processing expenses by  marketing expenses by  and fdic premiums by  the increases in noninterest expense were offset by a decrease in employment expenses by  and a decrease of  in business development expenses 
net interest income 
net interest income  the difference between revenue generated from earning assets and the interest cost of funding those assets  is our primary source of earnings 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  netting million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  were million and million  respectively  resulting in million in net interest income 
interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million and million  respectively  providing for net interest income of million 
the decrease of  in net interest income in from was due to a decrease in net interest margin  elevated levels of non performing assets  and a purposeful decrease in total loans 
we decided to lower our total loans outstanding to focus on improving asset quality and increasing liquidity through the purchase of investments 
while the nonperforming assets remained high in  they have decreased by  since december  the decrease in nonperforming assets and the purposeful decrease in loans reflect the company s focus on improving asset quality  improving profitability  and recognizing the challenging economic environment 
the net yield on average earning assets during was compared to for and for the decrease in net yield during was due to a basis point drop in interest rates  specifically the fed funds rate which was down to to at december  the net yield on average earning assets was impacted by the change in the mix between higher yielding loans to lower yielding securities 
deposit costs decreased as a result of a shift of certificate of deposits greater than  to lower cost core deposits  such as non interest bearing and interest bearing checking accounts which increased by million and million  respectively  since december  health savings accounts were the primary increase in interest bearing checking as they increased by million throughout the year 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  asset quality  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

the provision for loan losses was million for  million for and million for in  the amount recorded to provision expense was driven by a downturn in the economy 
a portion of the provision expense was recorded due to further deterioriation requiring additional reserves from the residential real estate development loans identified in in  the provision expense was primarily due to significant charge offs related to a group of pre residential real estate development loans made up of different parties within the same development 
the provision was a result of some net charge off activity  as well as significant growth of the loan portfolio and the portfolio composition and risk 
the provision expense reflects a million decrease from the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was  and at december    and  respectively 
in  as the economy continued to deteriorate and the residential development and home building sectors continued to severely weaken  we continued to increase our overall loan reserve in anticipation of stress on certain portions of our loan portfolio 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon our historical loan loss experience  along with the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  as well as known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
we had million of nonperforming loans at december   a decrease of million from the million of nonperforming loans at december  nonperforming loans were million at december  we reported million of net charge offs  or 
of average loans during compared to million in net charge offs or of average loans during and  in net charge offs during the loan portfolio decreased during by million or approximately due to the company s focus on improving asset quality  profitability  and liquidity  along with a recognition of declining economic trends 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
fees from trust and brokerage services grew resulting from an increasing base of accounts and assets under management  and was million for compared to million for and million in loan broker fees were  during  an increase of  or from  for loan broker fees were  for the increase in and was attributable to an effort to place less real estate mortgages in our portfolio and to sell them to the secondary market compared to years and prior 
deposit service charges were million in  showing an increase of  or from deposit service charges increased  or between and the increase from to was driven by the implementation of a new over draft protection plan  which accounted for a majority of the increase 
the over draft protection plan proved valuable as the service charges remained at the same level as in addition to the above  noninterest income results included a gain of  in and a loss of  in on the sale of securities available for sale 
there were no gains or losses on the sale of afs securities in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  million or during over the increase in expenses is attributable to an increase in fdic insurance premiums and data processing offset by a decrease in employment costs 
salary and benefit costs decreased  or  and were of total noninterest expenses 
while there was only a decrease of full time equivalent employees fte comparing december to december of  the average number ftes for was compared to in the decrease in average full time employees was primarily due to a workforce reduction that took place in april occupancy and equipment costs increased  or  and were million or of total non interest expenses 
occupancy and equipment costs increased as a result of the warsaw branch being in operation for its first full year 
we announced the closure of our angola branch during the fourth quarter of and closed the branch effective february loan and professional costs increased during from prior year levels by  or 
these costs increased due to outsourcing our loan review and internal audit functions  along with increased costs associated with the workout of non performing assets 
marketing expenses increased by  or  due to the company becoming more aggressive in promoting the tower bank brand through different marketing venues  such as television and radio commercials 
data processing expenses increased by  or  due to upgrading and converting to a new on line banking system 
premiums for deposit insurance from the fdic have continued to increase in by  from the increase from to was due to a change in the assessment formula applied by the fdic to all insured banks 
based on current economic conditions and increasing financial institution failures  the premiums are set to rise again in to offset additional bank failures expected and the additional operating expense incurred from increased resolution activities 
other various expense categories decreased during  such as business development and courier services  but to a lesser dollar amount than those mentioned above 
other expense was million for  million for and million for  which reflected a  or decrease in and a  or in  as compared to the prior year 
during  salaries and benefits costs were million  while occupancy and equipment expenses totaled million 
additional large overhead expenses in included costs for professional fees and services  which amounted to million and data processing expenses of  significant noninterest expenses during were million for salary and benefit costs  million for occupancy and equipment costs  million for loan and professional costs  and data processing expense of  monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to us 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in the overall level of efficiency ratio continues to be high but reflects a decrease in net interest income caused by steep interest rate cuts taken in as anticipated  improvement in the efficiency ratio is dependent upon the growth in earning assets along with the development of fee based products and the resulting increases in revenue 
management expects that as additional asset growth and operating efficiencies are realized we will earn more on the larger base of earning assets  while operating costs will increase at a lesser rate  resulting in an improved efficiency ratio 
income taxes expense 
during  we recorded  of income tax expense 
in and  we recorded million of income tax benefit and million of income tax expense  respectively 
the effective tax rate recorded for was as compared to for and for while the effective interest rate remained low in  it increased due to modest levels of income before tax compared to a net loss in the low effective tax rate in was primarily due to modest levels of income offset by tax exempt investment income derived from investing in municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance 
tax exempt income of  and  were recognized in on municipal bonds and bank owned life insurance  respectively 
we also formed an investment subsidiary structure and established a real estate investment trust in the ownership structure of this real estate investment trust provides us with an alternative vehicle for raising capital should we so desire  as well as providing us with certain state income tax benefits  which will lower our effective state tax rate for the year and future 
the tax benefit in is the result of the net loss posted  as well as certain tax exempt interest income 
capital sources stockholders equity is a noninterest bearing source of funds  which provides support for asset growth 
stockholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
stockholders equity increased during from net income of million  by  in the net exercise of stock options  and  from stock option and restricted stock compensation expense per fasb r 
the increase was offset slightly by  from dividends to shareholders and  from the repurchase of common stock at an average price per share of

the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet the various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
currently  both the company and the bank have been categorized as well capitalized  the highest classification contained within the banking regulations 
the capital ratios of the company and the bank as of december  and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our ability to pay cash and stock dividends is subject to limitations under various laws and regulations and to prudent and sound banking practices 
prior to no cash or stock dividends were paid 
in december  our board of directors formally approved the payment of dividends commencing in calendar this was based on an analysis of our liquidity needs  regulatory and capital requirements  and results of operations 
during  we paid dividends at annual rate of per share payable in four quarterly installments 
this was increased in by  which resulted in dividends paid totaling per share 
in january  our board of directors voted to pay a dividend of per share for the first quarter dividend payment 
in the second quarter of  the company issued a press release stating that it elected to forego the declaration of a dividend on its common stock indefinitely 
the decision was based on the desire to retain capital and hedge against challenging economic and banking industry conditions as well as to maintain tower bank s current well capitalized status within the federal reserve system 
liquidity and capital ratios december loan to deposit ratio loan to funding ratio total risk based capital tier risk based capital tier leverage capital liquidity liquidity is measured by our ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital or cash flow from the repayment of loans and investment securities 
these funds are used to meet depositor withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  to fund loans and to fund operational expenses 
liquidity is primarily achieved through the growth of deposits and liquid assets such as securities available for sale  cash flow from securities  matured securities  and federal funds sold 
asset and liability management is the process of managing the balance sheet to achieve a mix of earning assets and liabilities that maximize profitability while providing adequate liquidity 
our liquidity strategy is to fund growth with deposits from both in market and out of market sources  federal home loan bank borrowings and to maintain an adequate level of short term and medium term investments to meet typical daily loan and deposit activity needs 
as loan growth declined by million we were able to allow higher costing deposits to run off 
overall deposits declined by million compared to moderate deposit growth in of million 
we mainly generated deposits from in market sources  however  we expanded our funding base during to include national  non brokered certificates of deposit  borrowings from the fhlb and trust preferred securities 
during we further expanded our funding base to include brokered deposits 
at december   the balance brokered cds and fhlb borrowings were million and million respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at december  we expect loan growth to increase 
funding for the loan growth will continue to come from in market sources through the marketing of products and the development of branch locations 
we will also continue to develop wholesale and out of market deposits and borrowing capacities and use them to augment interest rate sensitivity strategies and liquidity capabilities and to diversify the funding base of the bank 
we have the ability to borrow money on a daily basis through correspondent banks federal funds purchased along with borrowings from the federal reserve discount window  and had no borrowings at december  and additional capacity to borrow overnight in the form of unused lines of commitment from correspondent banks totaled million at december  and million at december  while the unused line at the discount window totaled million at december  and december  we view this type of funding as a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  we also need to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment  is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower

financial condition during  we continued to moderate the bank s loan growth as elected toward the end of  while continuing to grow the trust company 
total assets were million at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in assets was mainly attributable to a purposeful decrease in the loan portfolio to allow the company to focus on improving asset quality and increasing liquidity 
the decrease in loans was followed by a decrease in deposits which was primarily allowing higher cost deposits to runoff 
asset growth had been substantial during each year since we began operations  but slowed in due to management s decision to focus on improving asset quality  increasing liquidity  and improving profitability while factoring in the uncertain and challenging economic times ahead 
management anticipates that  in the near term  assets will begin to grow again  but at a slower pace than in its earlier years 
the source of this growth will be primarily from the marketing of our products  providing banking expertise and trust services  delivering a high level of customer service and developing our branch network 
earning assets 
the bank s loan portfolio experienced a decline of million  or  during loans were million at december  compared to million at december  the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates and were made to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables  and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentrations of credit within the commercial and commercial real estate category are represented by owner occupied and investment real estate at million or of total loans  and building  development and general contracting at million  or of total loans 
while the general portfolio mix has remained about the same  the main direction the bank has taken was to put more resources into the commercial versus the commercial real estate product 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking 
business banking is an area of expertise for the bank s management and lending team

these guidelines include procedures for loan review and to elicit the identification of problem loans as early as practical in order to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
we strive  through application of our credit policies and procedures  to minimize the risks and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  we must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing general economic conditions and changes in consumer preferences  government monetary policies  changes in a borrower s financial condition  and other factors that can affect a loan s collectability 
identified problem loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watchlist

we allocate specific portions of the allowance for loan losses to specifically identified problem loans 
our evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
we believe that the present allowance is adequate  based on the foregoing broad range of considerations

this investment is a preferred term security ltd and is held by our investment subsidiary 
the investment is collateralized by underlying investments in trust preferred securities issued by many different banks and insurance companies

based on the latest trustee reports  discussions with underwriters  review of third party analysis of the trust preferred portfolio  review of underlying financial information and review of projected cash flows  we believe that no adverse change in estimated cash flows occurred during and currently anticipate no interruption of future cash flows

we had no short term borrowings at december  or december  we did have borrowings in the amount of million in fhlb bullet advances at december  compared to million at december  as noted above  the increase in fhlb borrowings during was a result of the drop in deposits due to interest rate decreases 
we had million of aggregate principal amount in junior subordinated debenture outstanding at december  and we currently have two statutory trust subsidiaries 
tct  which was dissolved in  effected a private placement of million in trust preferred securities on november  and was paid off in november tct effected a private placement of million in trust preferred securities on december  tct effected a private placement of million on december  the proceeds were loaned to us in exchange for junior subordinated debentures with similar terms to the trust preferred securities 
these securities are considered tier i capital with certain limitations applicable under current regulatory guidelines 
the junior subordinated debentures are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the trust preferred securities at maturity or their earlier redemption at the par amount 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct was november  subject to federal reserve bank prior approval  the trust preferred securities were redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning november  and we in fact redeemed them at that time 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning december  and each year thereafter at our option 
the maturity date of the trust preferred securities issued by tct is december  subject to our having received prior approval of the federal reserve bank  if then required  the trust preferred securities are redeemable prior to the maturity date beginning december  and each year thereafter at our option 
in january  at the request of our regulators  our board of directors adopted a resolution requiring that we seek written approval from the federal reserve bank of chicago prior to incurring any additional parent company debt  including the addition of trust preferred securities and advances on any existing lines of credit 
in may  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of outstanding common stock 
by december   all  approved shares have been repurchased at an average price of 
the board also adopted a resolution requiring that we seek approval from the federal reserve bank of chicago prior to repurchasing any further shares in an amount exceeding  other than those shares covered by the may repurchase plan 
this resolution was also at the request of our regulators 
stockholders equity was million at december  and million at december  the increase of million was mainly attributable to the net income of million posted in  the repurchase of common stock totaling  and dividends paid of  this was partially offset by proceeds from the net exercise of stock options totaling  other items affecting stockholders equity was a  decrease in net unrealized appreciation on securities available for sale and derivative instruments  net of tax and stock compensation expense of  per the rules of fasb r 
at december   we had a balance of million in retained earnings while at december  the balance was million  an increase of million from due to the net income posted in and dividend paid

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
we derive our income primarily from the excess of interest collected on our interest earning assets over the interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest we earn on our assets and owe on our liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  we are exposed to lower profitability if we cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to our earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to our safety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
our interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  we assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on our financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques that we may use 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced during a given time period 
a significant repricing gap could result in a negative impact to our net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the following table describes our position as of december  rate sensitivity analysis within three to one to after three twelve five five in thousands months months years years total assets federal funds sold  short term investments and interest earning deposits securities available for sale fhlbi and frb stock loans held for sale fixed rate loans variable rate loans allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing checking savings accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  and over short term borrowings fhlb advances junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing checking other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total sources of funds net asset liability gap cumulative gap percent of cumulative gap to total assets a second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and our strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  we began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually reprice 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as our historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows and  as applicable related weighted average interest rates based upon our historical experience  and management s judgment as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
the current historical interest rates for core deposits have been assumed to apply for future periods in this table as the actual interest rates that will need to be paid to maintain these deposits are not currently known 
weighted average variable rates are based upon contractual rates existing at the report date
