item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we engineer  manufacture and market air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standardized and custom rooftop units  chillers  air handling units  make up units  heat recovery units  condensing units  coils and boilers 
custom units are marketed and sold to retail  manufacturing  educational  medical and other commercial industries 
we market units to all states in the united states and certain provinces in canada 
foreign sales are less than of our sales as the majority of all sales are domestic 
we sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers representatives and our internal sales force 
demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors 
the commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts  but has a lag factor of months 
housing starts  in turn  are affected by such factors as interest rates  the state of the economy  population growth and the relative age of the population 
when new construction is down  we emphasize the replacement market 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead  freight out and engineering expense 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
the raw materials market was volatile during due to the economic environment 
raw materials pricing had steadily increased from the beginning of until the second half of when pricing sharply decreased 
we experienced raw materials price increases of approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from through the second quarter of prices decreased by approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from june  to december  we attempt to limit the impact of price increases on these materials by entering cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
selling  general  and administrative sg a costs include our internal sales force  warranty costs  profit sharing and administrative expense 
warranty expense is estimated based on historical trends and other factors 
our product warranty policy is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or months from date of shipment for parts only  an additional four years on compressors if applicable  years on gas fired heat exchangers if applicable  and years on stainless steel heat exchangers if applicable 
warranty charges on heat exchangers do not occur frequently

we utilize of the expansion facility and the remaining is leased to a third party 
the third party lease expires may   at which time the facility will be remodeled to give us increased manufacturing capacity 
the capital expenditures budget reflects the projected outlay to remodel the facility 
we conduct other operations in a plant office building at gum springs road in longview  texas  containing  square feet  sq

results of operations key events impacting our cash balance  financial condition  and results of operations in include the following o an increase in the volume of sales on all product lines due to market share gains and effective moderation of commodity costs with purchase agreements and pricing strategies affecting gross margin  resulted in significantly higher revenues and net income 
the large volume of sales also lowered the effect of major fixed costs in general and administrative expenses and occupancy expenses 
o we remained the leader in the industry for environmentally friendly  energy efficient and quality innovations  utilizing ra refrigerant and phasing out pollutant causing r refrigerant 
the phase out of r began at the beginning of we also utilize a high performance composite foam panel to eliminate over half of the heat transfer from typical fiberglass insulated panels 
we continue to utilize sloped condenser coils  and access compartments to filters  motor  and fans 
all of these innovations increase the demand for our products thus increasing market share 
o in february  our board of directors initiated a program of semi annual cash dividend payments 
cash payments of million were made in million paid in january and july  respectively  and million was accrued as a liability for payment in january o stock repurchases of our stock from employee s k savings and investments plan was authorized in stock repurchases of our stock from directors was authorized in stock repurchases of our stock from the open market was authorized and initiated in november total repurchases resulted in cash payments of million 
this cash outlay is partially offset by cash received from options exercised by employees as a part of an incentive bonus program 
the cash received in from options exercised was million 
o borrowings under the line of credit were million and approximately  in interest expense was paid in borrowings under the line of credit where interest is accrued are relatively short and generally paid off within the month incurred or the following month 
at the end of there was million outstanding on the line of credit 
o purchases of equipment and renovations to manufacturing facilities remained a priority 
aaon s capital expenditures were million 
equipment purchases create significant efficiencies  lower production costs and allow continued growth in production 
we currently estimate dedicating million to million to capital expenditures in for continued growth 
net sales net sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sales increased million or which was attributable to an increase in volume of product sold related to our new and redesigned products being favorably received by our customers  the diversified customer mix of products  active marketing by sales representatives and pricing strategies implemented in order to keep up with increasing raw material costs 
the increase in sales in of million or was attributable to an increase in volume of product sold related to our new and redesigned products being favorably received by our customers  active marketing by sales representatives and pricing strategies implemented on of our product lines in the second quarter in order to keep up with increasing raw material costs 
new commercial construction steadily improved throughout and  contributing to growth of the market 
gross profit gross margins in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  gross margins were  and for the years ended  and the increase in gross profit for  resulted from pricing strategies implemented and production and labor efficiencies  as sales volume increased 
we saw a decrease in raw material costs in the second half of the year  which also contributed to higher gross profits 
management anticipates the moderation of commodity costs through relationships with suppliers and price decreases in certain commodity costs  if realized  should enhance gross margins 
due to an increase in the volume of sales  actual gross profit for increased by million from  and by million from to the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
the raw materials market was volatile during due to the economic environment 
raw materials pricing had steadily increased from the beginning of until the second half of when pricing sharply decreased 
we experienced raw materials price increases of approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from through the second quarter of prices decreased by approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from june  to december  we attempt to limit the impact of price increases on these materials by entering cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
we also purchase from other domestic manufacturers certain components  including compressors  electric motors and electrical controls used in our products 
the suppliers of these components are significantly affected by the raw material costs as steel  copper and aluminum are used in the manufacturing of their products 
while raw material costs decreased in the last half of the year  increases in component parts were experienced throughout we instituted several price increases to customers from to in an attempt to offset the continued increases in steel  copper  aluminum  and component parts 
we attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended  and the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to an increase in selling related expenses  warranty expense caused by increased sales  increase in profit sharing resulting from an increase in net income  and an overall increase in general and administrative expenses 
in  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily caused by an increase in sales expenditures for an increased sales force and active marketing  increases in salaries for selling  general and administrative personnel and an increase in profit sharing 
there were additional non cash compensation costs for the fair value of stock options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
interest expense interest expense was approximately   and  for the years ended  and the increase in interest expense of approximately  in was due to higher average borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a result of a decrease in net cash provided by operations related to the stock repurchases 
the decrease in interest expense of approximately  from to was due to a decrease in average borrowings under the revolving credit facility and interest rates 
interest on borrowings is payable monthly at the wall street journal prime rate less or libor plus  at our election at december  
average borrowings under the revolving credit facility are typically paid in full within the month of borrowing or the following month 
interest income interest income was approximately   and  in  and respectively 
the increase in interest income is due to interest paid for repurchased stock shares that were held in transit by the transfer agent in early other income expense other income was approximately  in other expense was approximately  in the change in other income expense was primarily related to foreign currency losses that result from operations in canada in and other income was approximately  in other income is attributable primarily to rental income from our expansion facility 
all expenses associated with the facility that are allocated to the rental portion of the building are included in other income 
we plan to continue to rent the expansion facility until the lease term expires on may  impact of current economic conditions our business is affected by a number of economic factors  including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate 
the current state of the united states economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets 
the current decline in economic activity in the united states could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built  which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates  inflation  consumer spending habits  employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control 
in the heating  ventilation  and air conditioning hvac business  a decline in economic activity as a result of these cyclical or other factors typically results in a decline in new construction and replacement purchases  which could result in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability 
although the volatile economic conditions did not significantly affect our business in  the impact the economy will have on us in is still unknown 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the occasional use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time 
cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities has fluctuated from year to year 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the year to year variances are primarily from results of changes in net income  accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net income for fiscal year was million  an increase of million from the increase in net income during fiscal years and compared to fiscal years and was primarily due to increased volume of sales  adjusted pricing strategies  fluctuations in raw materials costs  innovative and efficient products  and improved production efficiencies 
depreciation expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in depreciation is due to the realization of full depreciation of certain capital assets 
we adopted sfas r in share based compensation was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
both depreciation expense and share based compensation expense decreased net income but had no effect on operating cash 
accounts receivable balances did not significantly fluctuate in even though sales increased 
accounts receivable increased during and from the increase in sales 
accounts receivable increased by million at december  compared to december  the increase at december  from december  was million 
inventories increased by million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the increase in was attributable to procurement of inventory to accommodate an increase of sales 
the leading factor in the increase in and is primarily related to the valuation of inventories due to higher raw material and component parts costs 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by million at december  and increased by million and million at december  and the decrease in is primarily due to timing of payments to vendors and a decrease in workers compensation expense 
the increase in is due to an increase in commissions payable related to the increase in sales  timing of commissions payable and payments to vendors 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities in and was million and million  respectively  and primarily related to a decrease in capital expenditures 
management utilizes cash flows provided from operating activities to fund capital expenditures that are expected to increase growth and create efficiencies 
due to anticipated production demands  we expect to expend approximately million to million in for a building expansion  a building renovation of the leased facility and equipment 
we expect the cash requirements to be provided from cash flows from operations 
we did not invest in any certificates of deposits in and  respectively 
a previously invested certificate of deposit matured in the first quarter of cash flows used in financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase of cash used in financing activities primarily relates to cash dividends declared and paid and the continued repurchase of our stock 
we occasionally utilize the revolving line of credit as described below in general to meet certain short term cash demands based on our current liquidity at the time 
we have million of borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at december  we had no net borrowings under the revolving line of credit at december  we accessed million and million of borrowings under the line of credit during and  respectively

general our revolving credit facility provides for maximum borrowings of million which is provided by the bank of oklahoma  national association 
under the line of credit  there is one standby letter of credit totaling million 
the letter of credit is a requirement of our workers compensation insurance and was extended in and will expire on december  interest on borrowings is payable monthly at the wall street journal prime rate less or libor plus  at our election at december  
no fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount 
at december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings available under the revolving credit facility at december   were million

on july   we renewed the line of credit with a maturity date of july  we expect to renew our revolving credit agreement in july we do not anticipate that the current situation in the credit market will impact our renewal 
on july   our board of directors approved a three for two stock split of our outstanding stock for shareholders of record as of august  the stock split was treated as a stock dividend which was distributed on august  as a result of the stock split  our board of directors adjusted the dividend paid per share to 
the applicable share and per share data for and included herein has been restated to reflect the stock split management believes projected cash flows from operations and our bank revolving credit facility or comparable financing will provide us the necessary liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
the belief that we will have the necessary liquidity and capital resources is based upon management s knowledge of the hvac industry and our place in that industry  our ability to limit our growth if necessary  our ability to authorize dividend cash payments  and our relationship with our existing bank lender 
for information concerning our revolving credit facility at december   see note to the consolidated financial statements  revolving credit facility 
commitments and contractual agreements the following table summarizes our long term debt and other contractual agreements as of december  payments due by period in thousands caption contractual financial obligations less than after total year years years years 
del long term debt and capital leases purchase commitments total contractual obligations   del 
purchase commitments consist primarily of copper commitments 
in the normal course of business we expect to purchase approximately million of raw materials in the form of legally binding commitments 
the fixed rate interest on long term debt includes the amount of interest due on our fixed rate long term debt 
these amounts do not include interest on our variable rate obligation related to the revolving credit facility 
we are a party to several short term  cancelable and noncancelable  fixed price contracts with major suppliers for the purchase of raw material and component parts 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment  future actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions on a monthly basis 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of estimation or assumption revenue recognition we recognize revenues from sales of products when the products are shipped and the title and risk of ownership pass to the customer 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual agreements 
sales allowances and customer incentives are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experiences and current estimates 
for sales initiated by independent manufacturer representatives  we recognize revenues net of the representatives commission 
our policy is to record the collection and payment of sales taxes through a liability account 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends in collections and write offs  current customer status  the age of the receivable  economic conditions and other information 
aged receivables are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if the reserve is adequate and adjusted accordingly at that time 
the evaluation of these factors involves complex  subjective judgments 
thus  changes in these factors or changes in economic circumstances may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves we establish a reserve for inventories based on the change in inventory requirements due to product line changes  the feasibility of using obsolete parts for upgraded part substitutions  the required parts needed for part supply sales  replacement parts and for estimated shrinkage 
warranty a provision is made for estimated warranty costs at the time the product is shipped and revenue is recognized 
the warranty period is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or months from date of shipment for parts only  an additional four years on compressors if applicable  years on gas fired heat exchangers if applicable  and years on stainless steel heat exchangers if applicable 
warranty expense is estimated based on the warranty period  historical warranty trends and associated costs  and any known identifiable warranty issue 
warranty charges associated with heat exchanges do not occur frequently 
due to the absence of warranty history on new products  an additional provision may be made for such products 
our estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in actual warranty trends and cost experience 
should actual claim rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated product warranty liability would be required 
medical insurance a provision is made for medical costs associated with our medical employee benefit plan  which is primarily a self funded plan 
a provision is made for estimated medical costs based on historical claims paid and potential significant future claims 
the plan is supplemented by employee contributions and an excess policy for claims over  each 
stock compensation we adopted sfas r  effective january  applying this standard to value equity based compensation requires us to use significant judgment and to make estimates  particularly for the assumptions used in the black scholes valuation model  such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as for the expected option forfeiture rates 
in accordance with sfas r we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments using the black scholes valuation model to calculate the grant date fair value of the award 
the compensation cost is recognized over the period of time during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which will be the vesting period 
historically  actual results have been within management s expectations 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb released sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
although sfas applies to and amends the provisions of existing authoritative literature  it does not  of itself  require any new fair value measurements or establish valuation standards 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which creates an alternative measurement treatment for certain financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits fair value to be used for both the initial and subsequent measurements on an instrument by instrument basis  with changes in the fair value to be recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
this election is referred to as the fair value option 
sfas also requires additional disclosures to compensate for the lack of comparability that will arise from the use of the fair value option 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the fair value option has not been elected for any financial assets or liabilities at december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaced fasb statement  business combination  which changes the accounting for business combinations and noncontrolling interests 
among other things  when compared to the predecessor guidance sfas r will require i more assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date  ii liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured to fair value each subsequent reporting period  and iii acquirer in preacquisition periods to expense all acquisition related costs 
sfas r must be applied prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect adoption of sfas r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas  which changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas must be adopted no later than january  we do not expect adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which requires enhanced disclosures about i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  ii how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas and its related interpretations and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued no 
 determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities eitf  which addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore  need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share eps under the two class method 
eitf will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
all prior period eps data presented will be adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of eitf we are evaluating the expected impact of adoption of eitf in december  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets fas r  which provides guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan and requires employers to provide more transparency about the assets held by retirement plan and the concentrations of risk in those plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our revolving credit facility  which bears variable interest based upon a prime or libor rate 
we had million outstanding as of december  foreign sales accounted for less than approximately of our sales in and we accept payment for such sales in us and canadian dollars  therefore  we believe we are not exposed to significant foreign currency exchange rate risk on these sales 
foreign currency transactions and financial statements are translated in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency  except for the canadian subsidiaries  which use the canadian dollar 
adjustments arising from translation of the canadian subsidiaries financial statements are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
transaction gains or losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations applicable to transactions denominated in canadian currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the united states dollar was and at december  and  respectively 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
the raw materials market was volatile during due to the economic environment 
raw materials pricing had steadily increased from the beginning of until the second half of when pricing sharply decreased 
we experienced raw materials price increases of approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from through the second quarter of prices decreased by approximately for steel  for aluminum and for copper from june  to december  we attempt to limit the impact of price increases on these materials by entering cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or raw materials price risks
