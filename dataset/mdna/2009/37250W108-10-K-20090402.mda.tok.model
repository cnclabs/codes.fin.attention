item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this annual report 
backlog includes our sla with the nga  access fee agreements with our international regional affiliates  regional affiliate ground station operations and maintenance contracts  commercial imagery contracts and value added products and services 
our backlog as of december  included approximately million of contracts with the us government  including approximately million related specifically to the service level agreement 
most of our government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis  however  certain international regional affiliates have signed multi year access fee and operating and maintenance contracts 
changes in government policies  priorities or funding levels through agency or program budget reductions by the us congress or executive agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government at any time  with or without cause  which could result in a reduction in backlog 
company history geoeye was initially organized as orbimage holdings  inc  delaware corporation  on april  it was formed to enable its predecessor registrant  and subsequently its wholly owned subsidiary  orbimage inc  a delaware corporation  to implement a holding company organizational structure 
orbimage inc was established on december  in conjunction with orbital imaging corporation s reorganization and emergence from chapter bankruptcy 
effective june   we reorganized into a holding company structure  by means of a merger conducted pursuant to section g of the general corporation law of the state of delaware the merger 
as a result of the merger  each stockholder of orbimage inc became a holder of the common stock of orbimage holdings inc  evidencing the same proportional interests  and orbimage inc became a direct  wholly owned subsidiary of orbimage holdings inc accordingly  the company became the successor registrant of orbimage inc on january   we adopted the brand name geoeye 
on september   the stockholders of the company voted to formally change the legal name of the company from orbimage holdings  inc to geoeye  inc 
on september   we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement purchase agreement to acquire the operating assets of space imaging 
on january   we completed the acquisition of space imaging pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement 
the final cash purchase price  including acquisition costs  was approximately million 
the acquisition was financed mainly through the incurrence of million of indebtedness 
we were required to prepay the debt with of the excess cash flows of the acquired operations calculated on a quarterly basis 
we finished repaying the debt on february  on march   we acquired mj harden associates  inc mj harden through a stock purchase of all of the outstanding stock of mj harden s sole owner  i  inc mj harden is an industry leading provider of digital aerial imagery and geospatial information solutions 
competition we compete against various private companies  as well as systems owned by the us government and foreign state sponsored entities that provide satellite and aerial imagery and related products and services to the commercial market 
our major existing and potential competitor for high resolution satellite imagery is digitalglobe  inc digitalglobe  a privately held commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content  and operator of civilian remote sensing spacecraft 
international competitors for high resolution satellite imagery related products include  national remote sensing agency  department of space government of india  radarsat international canada  imagesat international nv israel  spot image sa france  taiwan and korea 
for risks associated with competition  see item a 
risk factors 
employees at december   we had employees 
generally  our employees are retained on an at will basis 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key employees 
certain of our employees have non competition agreements that prohibit them from competing with us for various periods following termination of their employment 
government regulation the satellite remote imaging industry is a highly regulated industry  both domestically and internationally 
in the us  the operation of remote imaging satellites generally requires licenses from the department of commerce doc and from the federal communications commission fcc 
furthermore  remote sensing satellite and ground control station technologies are subject to us export control licensing and regulation under the international traffic in arms regulations itar administered by the department of state and the export administration regulations ear administered by the doc 
in addition  we are party to certain classified us government contracts  the performance of which is subject to us facility and personnel clearance laws and regulations 
as is the case with any us business  we are subject to us government foreign corrupt practices act restrictions regarding conducting business with foreign government officials and us treasury department restrictions prohibiting conducting business with certain embargoed countries or entities or persons on the specifically designated nationals list maintained by the us treasury department 
finally  in order to provide satellite access services and imagery products internationally  our satellites may require international telecommunications union itu notification and registration and licenses from the governments of foreign countries where our services and products will be distributed 
united states doc regulation the doc  through the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa  is responsible for granting commercial imaging satellite operating licenses and for coordinating satellite imaging applications among several governmental agencies to ensure that any license addresses all us national security and foreign policy concerns  and complies with all international obligations of the united states 
we are required to obtain a doc license to operate each of our remote sensing satellite systems and provide imagery services to our customers 
we currently have doc licenses for all of our existing satellite systems 
we also hold a doc license that we intend to use subject to doc approval  for the geoeye satellite system that is being developed 
the doc licenses for our satellites are valid through the operational lifetime of each satellite 
we expect to satisfy the terms of each of the doc licenses for our satellites and to maintain the regulatory licenses and approvals necessary for their ongoing operations 
our doc licenses generally include the following key operating conditions we are required to maintain positive operational control of our satellite systems from a location within the united states at all times  we are restricted from disseminating to anyone other than the us government panchromatic imagery with a resolution better than meters or multispectral imagery with a resolution better than meters  the us government reserves the right to exercise shutter control the interruption of service by limiting imagery collection and or distribution as necessary to meet significant us government national security or foreign policy interests or international obligations 
although the us government has never exercised shutter control with respect to our satellite systems  the exercise of this authority would require us to make imagery data available exclusively to the us government by means of approved rekeyable encryption on the downlink 
we cannot anticipate whether or under what circumstances the us government would exercise its shutter control authority  nor can we reasonably determine what costs and terms would be negotiated between us and the us government in such event  we are required to obtain doc approval before implementing significant or substantial agreements with foreign nations  entities or consortiums foreign persons in order to protect the national security and foreign policy interests and international obligations of the us government 
transfers of significant or substantial agreements also require doc approval 
examples of significant or substantial agreements include customer agreements for high resolution imagery collection and distribution  operating agreements and agreements relating to equity investments in the company of or more of the total outstanding shares or that entitle a foreign person to a position on the company s board of directors 
foreign persons entering significant or substantial agreements with the company are required to comply with our doc license imagery collection and distribution restrictions and are subject to the us government s exercise of shutter control  which could adversely affect our ability to collect imagery products for distribution to our foreign customers  and we are restricted from disseminating imagery of the state of israel with a resolution better than meters 
fcc regulation the fcc is responsible for licensing commercial satellite and ground systems and the radio frequencies used by commercial satellite systems 
in general  the fcc grants licenses to commercial satellite systems that conform to the technical  legal and financial requirements for these systems set forth in fcc regulations 
below is a table summarizing the fcc license grant and expiration dates for the operation of our current satellites and related ground systems geoeye ikonos orbview orbview fcc satellite license grant date commercially operational yes yes yes yes in  but imaging operations ceased in march fcc satellite license expiration date october  renewable for or more years subject to fcc approval grant date of associated fcc ground station licenses expiration date of associated fcc ground station license april   renewable for years subject to fcc approval december   october   and october   renewable for years subject to fcc approval october   renewable for or more years subject to fcc approval april   renewable for years subject to fcc approval we expect that geoeye will operate in the same radio frequency bands as our geoeye and ikonos satellites and their associated ground stations  subject to fcc approval and that we will obtain the fcc licenses and approvals necessary for geoeye operations 
export controls and security clearance regulation we are subject to a complex set of export control and security clearance regulations for the products and services we offer 
among other things  we are a registrant under itar and we hold export licenses and other approvals from the us department of state s directorate of defense trade control ddtc for the export of hardware  software and technical data relating to the potential defense related satellites  ground stations  image processing facilities and support services provided to customers 
additional approvals may be required from ddtc and from the doc s bureau of industry and security in certain cases 
for example  export licenses may be required if certain foreign persons or entities are involved in the development or acquisition of our products and services 
also the export of a geoeye supplied ground station or image processing facility to a foreign person would require a ddtc export approval 
the suspension or cancellation of our itar registration or ddtc approval to export our products and services would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  we require certain facility and personnel security clearances to perform our classified us government related business 
security clearances are subject to regulations and requirements including the national industrial security program operating manual  which provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information released or disclosed to industry in connection with classified us government contracts 
the suspension or cancellation of our facility clearances  or the inability to maintain personnel security clearances for our personnel to perform classified us government contracts  would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
furthermore  any change in the ownership of geoeye involving a transfer to foreign persons or entities may increase us government scrutiny and lead to more onerous requirements in connection with both export controls and security clearances 
a transfer to foreign ownership could also trigger other requirements  including filings with and review by the committee on foreign investment in the united states pursuant to the exon florio provision and approval by noaa under our doc licenses 
depending on the country of origin and identity of foreign owners  other restrictions and requirements could arise 
future developments us regulators may subject us in the future to new laws  policies or regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies and regulations that modify the present us regulatory environment 
us regulators could decide to impose limitations on us companies that are currently applicable only to other countries  or other regulatory limitations that affect satellite remote imaging operations 
any limitations of this kind could adversely affect our business or our results of operations 
international all satellite systems providing services internationally must comply with the following general international regulations as well as the specific laws of the countries in which satellite imagery is downlinked or satellite imagery products are distributed 
international telecommunication union itu regulations itu regulations define for each service the technical operating parameters  including maximum transmitter power  maximum interference to other services and users and the minimum interference the user must operate under for that service 
the fcc  on our behalf  has completed the itu notification process for our ikonos  orbview and orbview satellite systems and we expect to complete this process for the geoeye satellite system within the next months 
intelsat inmarsat agreements the intelsat and inmarsat agreements require that operators of international satellite systems demonstrate that they will not cause technical harm to intelsat and inmarsat satellites 
we have completed this process for our orbview satellite and believe that the frequencies in use by the ikonos  orbview and geoeye satellites  and to be used by the geoeye satellite  will not cause any technical harm to the intelsat or inmarsat systems 
in the event that one of our satellite systems causes technical harm to the intelsat or inmarsat system  the fcc could fine us or seek to modify or terminate our underlying authorizations 
foreign downlink license the regulations of some foreign countries require satellite operators to secure appropriate licenses and operational authority to use the required spectrum in each country 
within foreign countries  our foreign customers are responsible for securing appropriate licenses and operational authority to use the required spectrum for downlinking our high resolution satellite imagery with assistance from us as required 
foreign imagery acquisition or distribution regulations the regulations or policies of foreign countries may restrict the acquisition or distribution of satellite imagery products and services 
for example  in the republic of india  we obtained permission from the government to promote satellite imagery product sales to customers in india  provided the actual product deliveries are made through a government appointed reseller 
while we believe we will be able to obtain all us  itu and foreign government licenses  authorizations and registrations necessary to provide services internationally  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so 
the failure to obtain some or all necessary licenses  approvals or registrations could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
item a 
risk factors the risks described below  among others  could cause geoeye s actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward looking statements made in this form k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
a substantial portion of our revenues are generated from contracts with us government agencies 
termination of these contracts at any given time could materially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business 
revenues from us government contracts accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  us government agencies may terminate or suspend their contracts at any time  with or without cause  or may change their policies  priorities or funding levels by reducing agency or program budgets or by imposing budgetary constraints 
our primary contract with the us government  through the nga  is the nextview imagery contract 
in the contract  nga originally agreed to order approximately million of imagery products beginning february  and continuing six quarters after the geoeye satellite s expected in service date 
the contract was subsequently modified in december to accommodate launch delays and to establish a sla whereby we provide a range of products and services rather than simply selling square kilometers of imagery 
further  the period of performance was changed to run through november  at a rate of million per month 
although we anticipate that the us government will either extend this contract or enter into a new contract before the end of the current period of performance  we cannot guarantee and there can be no assurances that they will continue to purchase at pre termination levels or at all 
if a us government agency terminates or suspends any of its contracts with us  or changes its policies  priorities  or funding levels  these actions would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot estimate what effect  if any  the new administration in the us will have on the demand for our products and services 
satellites have limited useful lives and are expensive to replace 
satellites have limited useful lives 
we determine a satellite s useful life  or its expected operational life  using a complex calculation involving the probabilities of failure of the satellite s components from design or manufacturing defects  environmental stresses or other causes 
the expected operational lives of our satellites are affected by a number of factors  including the quality of construction  the supply of fuel  the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels  the durability of various satellite components and the orbits in which the satellites are placed 
random failure of satellite components could cause damage to  or loss of  the use of a satellite before the end of its design life 
in rare cases  electrostatic storms or collisions with other objects could damage our satellites 
such objects could include debris from exploded satellites and spent rocket stages  dead satellites and meteoroids 
we cannot assure you that each satellite will remain in operation for its design life 
we expect the performance of each satellite to decline gradually near the end of its design life 
our geoeye satellite was launched in september and has an expected operational life of seven years 
ikonos was fully depreciated in june a study that was completed in august of by the ikonos manufacturer resulted in a revised life expectancy for ikonos to the timeframe 
based on that study  we currently expect to continue commercial operations with ikonos through that timeframe 
however  we can offer no assurance that ikonos will maintain its prescribed orbit or remain commercially operational 
despite the fact that orbview s operational life has expired  we currently expect to continue commercial operations with orbview in due to factors listed above  we cannot guarantee the use of orbview throughout or beyond 
replacing a satellite is expensive 
we anticipate using funds generated from operations to develop plans for future high resolution imagery satellites 
if we do not generate sufficient funds from operations or we cannot obtain financing from outside sources  we will not be able to deploy new satellites to replace geoeye at the end of its design life 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient funds from operations or to raise additional capital  on favorable terms or on a timely basis  if at all  to develop or deploy follow on high resolution satellites 
we cannot assure you that our satellites will operate as designed 
we may experience in orbit satellite failures or degradations in performance that could impair the commercial performance of our satellites  which could lead to lost revenue  an increase in our operating expenses  lower operating income or lost backlog 
our satellites employ advanced technologies and sensors that are subject to severe environmental stresses in space that could affect the satellite s performance 
hardware component problems in space could lead to degradation in performance or loss of functionality of the satellite  with attendant costs and revenue losses 
in addition  human operators may execute improper implementation commands that negatively impact a satellite s performance 
we cannot assure you that our satellites in orbit will continue to operate successfully throughout their expected remaining lives 
even if a satellite is operated properly  minor technical flaws in the satellite s sensors could significantly degrade their performance  which could materially affect our ability to market our products successfully 
our business model depends on our ability to sell imagery from our high resolution satellites 
we do not presently have plans to construct and launch a replacement satellite for ikonos or orbview if either fails prematurely 
although we are developing the geoeye satellite program  which will take approximately three to four years to complete  geoeye cannot be considered a near term replacement if the geoeye satellite were to fail 
any failure of our satellites or any interference with such satellites commercial operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business 
new or proposed satellites are subject to construction and launch delays  the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations 
we have in the past experienced delays in satellite construction and launch which have adversely affected our operations 
such delays can result from the delays in the construction of satellites and launch vehicles  the periodic unavailability of reliable launch opportunities  possible delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and launch failures 
a significant delay in the future delivery of any satellite may also adversely affect our marketing strategy for the satellite 
if satellite construction schedules are not met  a launch opportunity may not be available at the time a satellite is ready to be launched 
further  any significant delay in the commencement of service of any of our satellites could enable customers who pre purchased or agreed to utilize capacity on the satellite to terminate their contracts and could affect our plans to replace an in orbit satellite prior to the end of its service life 
delays in the launch of a satellite intended to replace an existing satellite that results in the existing satellite reaching its end of life before being replaced could result in loss of business to the extent an in orbit backup is not available 
we operate in a highly competitive and specialized industry and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can  which could result in loss of our market share 
our products and services compete with satellite and aircraft based imagery and related products and services offered by a range of private and government providers 
certain of these competitors may have greater financial  personnel and other resources than us 
our major existing us competitor for high resolution satellite imagery is digitalglobe  inc  a privately held commercial vendor of space imagery and geospatial content  and operator of civilian remote sensing spacecraft 
digitalglobe currently operates two high resolution satellites  quickbird  launched in  and worldview  launched in september under nga s nextview program 
digitalglobe announced that its worldview satellite is anticipated for launch in mid both worldview satellites have higher resolutions and more advanced technologies than our ikonos satellite 
both worldview satellites and geoeye can produce meter imagery the highest resolution that may be made available to non us government customers though worldview does not have the ability to produce color images 
historically we had a competitive advantage over digitalglobe regarding international markets because our high resolution satellites had the capability to directly download imagery to customers ground stations 
however  the worldview satellites now have the same capabilities 
current and future international competitors for high resolution satellite imagery customers include spot image sa france  india s national remote sensing agency  imagesat international nv israel and the governments of korea and taiwan 
in addition  the following operators of radar satellites provide a different type of satellite information but they could be considered to compete with us in the international market cosmo skymed italy  terrasar germany  and radarsat international canada 
many of our international competitors are either governmental agencies or receive funding from their governments which may allow them greater flexibility in pricing 
we also compete with aerial and unmanned aerial vehicles sometimes called uavs 
in the us  our aerial operations compete with several larger  better funded aerial imagery providers 
our competitors or potential competitors with greater resources than ours could in the future offer satellite based imagery or other products having more attractive features than our products 
the emergence of new remote imaging technologies  even if not ultimately successful  could negatively affect our ability to successfully penetrate existing or new markets using our existing technologies and retain our client base 
us and foreign governmental agencies may build and operate their own systems which could affect our current and potential market share of our products and services 
the us government and or foreign government agencies might develop  construct  launch and operate remote imaging satellites that generate non classified imagery products and services similar to geoeye s 
these products and services could cause a decrease in the demand of us and foreign governments to purchase our products and services 
in addition  such governmental agencies could sell imagery from their governmental satellites  which could also cause a decrease in demand for our imagery products 
the us government currently relies and is likely to continue to rely on government owned and operated systems for classified satellite based high resolution imagery 
the us government could reduce its purchases from commercial satellite imagery providers or decrease the number of companies to which it contracts with no corresponding increase in the total amount spent 
any reduction in purchasers of our products and services by the us government could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the success of our products and services will depend on market acceptance 
our success depends on existing markets accepting our imagery products and services and our ability to develop new markets 
our business plan is based on the assumption that we will generate significant future revenues from sales of high resolution imagery produced by geoeye and ikonos to our existing markets and to potentially new markets 
the commercial availability of high resolution satellite imagery is still a fairly new market 
consequently  it is difficult to predict accurately the ultimate size of the market and the market acceptance of our products and services 
our strategy to target certain markets for our satellite imagery relies on a number of assumptions  some or all of which may be incorrect 
the actual market for our products and services could vary materially from the potential markets that we have identified causing us to miss opportunities 
market acceptance of our high resolution satellite imagery products depends on a number of factors  including the spatial and spectral quality  scope  timeliness  sophistication and price and services and the availability of substitute products and services 
lack of significant market acceptance of our products and services particularly our high resolution imagery products and services  delays in acceptance  or failure of certain markets to develop would negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
foreign distributors and domestic value added resellers may not expand our commercial markets 
we rely on foreign regional distributors to market and sell our imagery from the geoeye and ikonos satellites internationally 
we are currently intensifying our efforts to develop further our current and future operations in international markets 
these regional distributors may not have the skill or experience to develop regional commercial markets for our products and services 
if we fail to enter into regional distribution agreements or if our foreign regional distributors fail to market and sell our imagery products and services abroad successfully  these failures could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on value added resellers to develop  market and sell our products and services to address certain target markets  including domestic markets  which may be vertical markets in defined industries or geographical markets 
if our value added resellers fail to develop  market and sell our products and services successfully  this failure could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance coverage may be more difficult and costly to obtain or maintain 
the terms of our senior secured floating rate notes due notes require  and we believe that the issuance of any future notes will require  us to obtain launch and on orbit insurance on geoeye and other subsequent satellites we construct and launch 
due to these covenants  we must maintain specified levels of on orbit operations insurance for geoeye  to the extent that such coverage can be obtained at a premium that is not disproportionately high 
we have currently secured million of insurance coverage for geoeye this insurance is not sufficient to cover the cost of a replacement high resolution imagery satellite such as geoeye we also carry million of insurance coverage on the ikonos satellite  but we do not carry any insurance coverage for the orbview satellite 
a partial or complete failure of a revenue producing satellite  whether insured or not  could require additional  unplanned capital expenditures  an acceleration of planned capital expenditures  interruptions in service  a reduction in contracted backlog and lost revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance market conditions or factors outside our control at a time when we would seek required insurance  such as failure of a satellite using similar components or a similar launch vehicle  could cause premiums to be significantly higher than current estimates 
higher premiums on insurance policies will increase our costs 
should the future terms of launch and on orbit insurance policies become less favorable than those currently available  this may result in limits on amounts of coverage that we can obtain or may prevent us from obtaining insurance at all 
any failure to obtain required insurance could cause a default under our current debt obligation 
the global financial crisis may impact our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the continuing credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system may have an impact on our business and our financial condition 
in particular  the cost of capital has increased substantially while the availability of funds from the capital markets has diminished significantly 
accordingly  our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted or be available only on terms we do not consider favorable 
limited access to the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or react to changing economic and business conditions and could adversely impact our strategy 
the current economic situation could have an impact on our customers  causing them to fail to meet obligations to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results from operations and cash flows 
state and local governments may be more vulnerable to the economic downturn  so our mj harden operations may face greater exposure to this risk 
the uncertainty and volatility of the global financial crisis may have further impacts on our business and our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows that we currently cannot predict or anticipate 
our business is capital intensive  and we may not be able to raise adequate capital to finance our business strategies  or we may be able to do so only on terms that significantly restrict our ability to operate our business 
implementation of our business strategy requires a substantial outlay of capital 
as we pursue our business strategies and seek to respond to opportunities and trends in our industry  our actual capital expenditures may differ from our expected capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our capital requirements in the future 
we currently expect that the majority of our liquidity requirements in will be satisfied by cash on hand  cash generated from our operations  and possible external financing 
however  we cannot provide assurances that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in amounts sufficient to enable us to execute our business strategy 
if we determine we need to obtain additional funds through external financing and are unable to do so  we may be prevented from fully implementing our business strategy 
lending institutions have suffered and may continue to suffer losses due to their lending and other financial relationships  especially because of the general weakening of the global economy 
as a result  changes in the financial markets may impact our ability to obtain new financing or refinance our existing debt on commercially reasonable terms and in adequate amounts  if at all 
in particular  the construction of our geoeye satellite will require significant capital  and the timing of the construction will vary depending on our ability to raise the necessary capital on terms which we deem to be acceptable 
we can provide no assurance that our businesses will be able to raise sufficient capital to allow for the construction of the geoeye satellite 
failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals could result in service interruptions or could impede us from executing our business plan 
us government approvals 
operation of our satellites requires licenses from the us department of commerce doc 
the failure to obtain these licenses  or the revocation of one or more licenses  could adversely affect our ability to conduct and generate revenue from these operations 
the doc licenses provide that the us government may interrupt service or otherwise limit our ability to distribute satellite images to certain parties in order to address national security or foreign policy concerns or because of the international obligations of the us actual or threatened interruptions or limitations on our service could adversely affect our ability to market our products 
in addition  the doc has the right to review and approve our agreements with foreign entities  including contracts with international customers for high resolution imagery 
we have received such approvals for the agreements in place with our existing international customers 
however  such reviews could delay or prohibit us from executing new international agreements 
in connection with customer agreements  we have in the past and may in the future supply our international customers with earth stations that enable these customers to downlink data directly from our satellites 
exporting these earth stations and technical information relating to these stations may require us to obtain export licenses from the doc or the us department of state 
if the doc or the us department of state does not issue these export licenses in connection with future exports  or if these licenses are significantly delayed or contain restrictions  or if the doc or the us department of state revokes  suspends or denies a request for renewal of existing licenses  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely effected 
our operation of satellites and earth stations also requires licenses from the us federal communications commission 
the fcc regulates the construction  launch and operation of our satellites  the use of satellite spectrum and the licensing of our earth station terminals located within the united states 
we currently have all required fcc licenses necessary to operate our business as it is currently conducted 
however  these licenses have expiration dates which are expected to occur while the satellites and ground systems are still in use 
the fcc generally renews licenses routinely  but there can be no assurance that our licenses will be renewed at their expiration dates for full terms or without adverse conditions 
failure to renew these licenses could have a material adverse affect on our ability to generate revenue and conduct our business as currently planned 
international registration and approvals 
the use of satellite spectrum is subject to the requirements of the international telecommunication union 
additionally  satellite operators must abide by the specific laws of the countries in which downlink services are provided from the satellite to earth station terminals within such countries 
our customers or distributors are responsible for obtaining local regulatory approval from the governments in the countries in which they receive imagery downlinked directly from our satellites to earth stations within such countries 
if these regional distributors are not successful in obtaining the necessary approvals  we will not be able to distribute real time imagery in those regions and this inability to offer real time service in a foreign country could negatively affect our business 
in addition  regulatory provisions in countries where we wish to operate may impose unduly burdensome restrictions on our operations 
our business may also be adversely affected if the national authorities where we plan to operate adopt treaties  regulations or legislation unfavorable to foreign companies or limiting the provision of our products and services 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting resulted in material misstatements in our financial statements that required us to restate certain of our historical financial statements 
if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations  investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities 
the audit committee of our board of directors  upon management s recommendation  has determined to restate certain of our historical financial statements and other financial information 
our management concluded that the accounting errors that necessitated the restatement resulted from control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting constituting material weaknesses 
specifically  our management concluded that we i had inadequate and ineffective controls over the periodic financial close process  and  ii did not maintain effective controls over the accuracy and valuation of the provision for income taxes 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
controls and procedures 
management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
as described in item a 
controls and procedures management s report on internal control over financial reporting  we have not yet fully remediated these material weaknesses 
until they are fully remediated  these material weaknesses could lead to errors in our reported financial results and could have a material adverse effect on our operations  investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities 
further  we cannot assure you that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  and cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated under section the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
our international business exposes us to risks relating to increased regulation and political or economic instability in foreign markets 
in  approximately of our total revenues were derived from international sales  and we intend to continue to pursue international contracts 
we expect to derive substantial revenues from international sales of our products and services 
international operations are subject to certain risks  such as changes in domestic and foreign governmental regulations and licensing requirements  deterioration of relations between the us and a particular foreign country  increases in tariffs and taxes and other trade barriers  changes in political and economic stability  including fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  which may make payment in us dollars  as provided for under our existing contracts  more expensive for foreign customers  and difficulties in obtaining or enforcing judgments in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends upon a limited number of key personnel 
our success depends on attracting  retaining and motivating highly skilled professionals 
a number of our employees are highly skilled engineers and other professionals 
in addition  our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of the members of our senior management 
if we fail to continue to attract  retain and motivate such professionals  our ability to compete in the industry could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our operating results could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including  without limitation risks and uncertainties affecting the current and proposed business of geoeye and the imagery derived products and processing service satellite industry  increased competition in the industry  and general economic conditions 
as a result of these possible fluctuations  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be reliable indicators of future performance 
the price of our common stock has been volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many companies in the technology sector 
in particular  over the last months  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for small companies  and which have often been unrelated to their operating performance or prospects for future operations 
these broad fluctuations may adversely impact the market price of our common stock

risk factors  which describes key risks associated with the company s operations and industry 
restatement of consolidated financial statements on march   management  with the approval of the audit committee of the board of directors  concluded we should restate our company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and and unaudited consolidated financial statements for each of the quarterly periods in  for the following items as disclosed in our company s quarterly report on form q for the nine months ended september   we determined that revenue had been overstated by million for additionally  we subsequently determined that certain other revenues had been understated by million for the impact of these adjustments is to decrease revenue by million for the year ended december   from million to million  to decrease accounts receivable by million and to decrease deferred revenues by million as of december  certain amounts included in satellite and related amounts were improperly capitalized and should be included in direct costs 
also  certain other costs related to in process projects were not properly recognized as direct costs in the correct period 
we have therefore increased direct costs by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have offset these amounts as a reduction to the capitalized costs for satellite and related rights for million and million as of december  and  respectively 
additionally  we have reduced prepaid expenses by million and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses by million as of december  we identified a million overstatement of certain accrued liabilities as of december  and have reduced selling  general and administrative expenses for to reduce these accrued liabilities 
as disclosed in our company s quarterly report on form q for the nine months ended september   capitalized interest had been calculated without properly considering amounts payable to subcontractors 
the reduction in capitalized satellite and related amounts  as discussed in item above  also resulted in an adjustment to the previously calculated capitalized interest 
consequently  interest expense has been increased by million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
these adjustments also reduced the capitalized satellite and related amounts costs for each corresponding period 
goodwill related to the mj harden acquisition has been increased and deferred tax asset reduced by million as of march  to properly account for the book and tax basis difference related to acquired fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets 
we incorrectly calculated the tax provisions for the years ended december   and due to an incorrect effective state tax rate and a discrepancy in the deferred tax balances from to the total overaccrual of the income tax payable and income tax provision was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  as a result of the preceding adjustments  the tax provision and the current tax payable were reduced by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  our cash flow statements have been adjusted to account for the restatement items listed above 
while this does not change the overall cash flow analysis  the change decreases operating cash flow with offsetting decreases to investing cash flows of million  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to these adjustments  we also reduced beginning retained earnings on january  by million to reflect the impact of capitalized interest and reductions in the capitalized satellite and related amounts  net of tax impact  and the overaccrual of the income tax payable and income tax provision for the year ended december   as explained in items  and above 
for a discussion of the significant restatement adjustments and the background leading to the adjustments  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
all amounts in this annual report on form k affected by the restatement adjustments reflect such amounts as restated 
overview geoeye is a premier provider of imagery  imagery information products and image processing services 
our products and services enable timely  accurate and accessible location intelligence 
we provide our products and services to the us government  including the national security community  international customers and north american commercial customers 
we have developed an advanced information technology infrastructure for capturing  receiving  processing and distributing high resolution and low resolution imagery  imagery information products and image processing services to customers around the world 
with our existing satellite and aerial infrastructure  which includes geoeye  currently the highest resolution commercial imaging satellite in the world  we are able to collect millions of square kilometers of imagery per year 
our collection systems and large scale product generation capabilities serve market demand worldwide for advanced imagery information products to map  measure and monitor the earth for a wide variety of applications including defense and intelligence  on line and precision mapping  infrastructure planning and monitoring  and environmental monitoring 
impact of significant transactions geoeye satellite the geoeye satellite was launched in september and started commercial operations on february  nga certified the imagery as meeting nga s specifications on february  and we commenced full operations 
geoeye is currently the world s highest resolution commercial remote sensing satellite which offers both black and white and color imagery 
the geoeye satellite was constructed as part of our participation in the nextview program created by the us government through nga 
total capitalized costs including financing and launch insurance costs of the geoeye satellite and related ground systems incurred were million as of december  approximately million of this amount was payable to subcontractors at december  under the nextview contract  nga agreed to support the project with a cost share totaling approximately million spread out over the course of the project development and subject to various milestones 
as of december   nga had paid us million of its cost sharing obligation 
we have deferred recognition of the cost share amounts from nga as revenue until geoeye s in service date which occurred on february  we will recognize revenue on a straight line basis over the depreciable life of the satellite which we believe will ultimately approximate the expected seven year life of the satellite 
as a result of the expected deployment geoeye for less than the maximum contractual cost  a portion of nga s cost share payments will be credited against its future imagery purchase obligation 
in september  as required under our debt indenture  we purchased million of launch plus first year on orbit insurance coverage and million of launch plus three year on orbit coverage for the geoeye satellite to be paid if the satellite s capabilities become impaired as measured against a set of specifications 
in august  we purchased an additional million of launch plus first year on orbit insurance in the event of the total loss of the satellite 
the premiums to be paid for the insurance policies total approximately million  of which million was paid as of december  the remaining million will be paid in two equal installments of million on the first and second anniversaries of geoeye s launch date  september  and  respectively  and the final million will be paid at the expiration of the launch plus three year on orbit policy  september the portion of the premiums associated with the insurance coverage of the launch and on orbit commissioning period prior to geoeye reaching start of commercial operations  are capitalized in the original cost of the satellite and will be amortized over the estimated life of the asset  which is currently seven years 
the remaining insurance premium amounts that are not capitalized are amortized to expense ratably over the related policy periods and are included in direct costs of revenue 
nextview program and service level agreement the nextview program was created by the us government  through the nga  in to support the continued development of the us commercial satellite imagery industry through contracts to support the engineering  construction and launch of the next generation of imagery satellites by two providers 
on september   nga awarded geoeye a contract as the second provider under the nextview program 
as noted previously  nga has supported the project development  under our nextview program award  with a cost sharing of approximately million 
the initial nextview contract with geoeye granted nga a right to purchase million of geoeye imagery products from us beginning in february of and continuing until six quarters after the geoeye in service date 
the initial nextview contract stipulated that nga would pay for imagery as it was delivered 
since the signing of the initial nextview contract  several amendments or modifications to our contractual relationship with nga have occurred on february   we entered into a modification to the initial contract which permitted nga to procure ikonos imagery as part of the million purchase commitment 
payment for such imagery occurred at the time of delivery 
as of december   nga had purchased million of imagery under this contract modification 
on december  we finalized a service level agreement modification to the nextview contract with nga 
under the service level agreement  nga will pay us million per month through november  nga s monthly payment is subject to our meeting a monthly imagery delivery volume requirement 
in the event we do not meet such volume requirement  nga will hold back up to of the monthly payment which will be utilized to purchase additional imagery from us on the backend of the contract period 
while the contract expires november   it is our expectation that the contract will be extended at a minimum until nga has purchased million of imagery and services 
the sla modification has replaced nga s remaining purchase commitment of million under the initial nextview contract 
the sla will provide us the ability to use either our geoeye or  subject to meeting required technical specifications for the delivered imagery  ikonos high resolution satellites to fulfill purchase orders from nga 
the service level agreement became effective on february  during  we received new production related contract awards totaling approximately million to supply products and related services to nga 
this includes a significant amount of value added  imagery based geospatial intelligence products including our airport mapping product line 
imagery processing and production will be performed at geoeye s advanced imagery processing centers located in st 
louis  mo and thornton  co 
geoeye satellite in october  we entered into a contract with itt corporation to begin work on the camera for our next earth imaging satellite  geoeye this was the first step in a phased development process for an advanced  third generation satellite 
geoeye will be of the same general class as geoeye  but will benefit from improvements in capability  including enhanced direct tasking  and the potential to collect imagery of the earth s surface at meter or inch ground resolution 
geoeye is slated for launch in the timeframe 
the company and itt are developing the sensor electronics and other elements of the camera s telescope  including the primary mirror 
we expect to contract with a satellite builder in  although the timing may vary depending on our perception of the market potential  especially the potential interest from the us government 
in light of the significant capital required to build geoeye and the current state of the financial markets  timing may also vary subject to our ability to raise the necessary capital on terms which we deem to be acceptable 
we will evaluate our options for financing the construction of geoeye in conjunction with the selection of the satellite builder 
we would expect to launch the satellite approximately three years after commencement of work by a selected contractor 
total capitalized costs for geoeye were approximately million as of december  business and industry factors business strategy with the successful launch and commencement of commercial operation of geoeye  we are now entering a new phase of our corporate development 
with a broad range of imagery collection assets  world class image processing and production facilities  and a strong global network of channel partners  we believe our company is positioned to be a leading global provider of imagery and imagery information products 
we plan to leverage our capabilities to further develop our range of products and services to meet the needs of the us government  commercial and international customers 
our focus will be to develop solutions that enable timely  accurate and accessible location based intelligence 
we plan to drive the success of our company as follows building on our existing customer base 
we are developing closer working relationships with our partners and their customers so that together we can jointly offer additional value added products and services to meet their needs  continued investment in corporate infrastructure 
in order to keep up with the growing demand for our production services  we are expanding our classified production capacity in thornton  co and our multi sensor  known in the industry as source agnostic  production capacity in st 
louis  mo 
to support the growth of our mj harden operation  we have purchased a third aircraft and a digital mapping camera  which will expand our service offerings 
in addition  with the successful launch of geofuse  our web based platform for imagery search and discovery  we will continue to invest in related technologies that will drive our ability to deliver new products through web services 
growth through acquisition and investment 
from time to time  we plan to consider selective acquisition and investment opportunities in companies that augment our technology portfolio  help expand our vertical market reach and strengthen our existing business lines 
industry factors the geospatial technologies industry is affected by many factors 
factors that drive market demand for our products and service include  but are not limited to  increased demand for technologies in response to national defense and environmental observation initiatives  commercial demand for satellite mapping technologies  infrastructure project initiatives and advances in communication technologies 
factors that could negatively impact market demand for our products and services include  but are not limited to  us and foreign governments launching their own imagery programs  the proliferation of competing surveillance technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles  us export constraints and decreasing defense budgets 
as with any industry there are trends  both positive and negative  that can have an impact on the commercial data providers 
positive trends include the following we expect that due to geopolitical uncertainty  global terrorist activity and large natural disasters  there will be continued demand from governments in the us and overseas for updated and accurate digital mapping databases 
defense personnel may be called upon to deploy to support actions in afghanistan and iraq and mission planners require the latest geospatial information 
as a result of terrorist activities  intelligence personnel around the world continue to need to monitor borders and other areas of interest 
in addition  the frequency of large natural disasters such as the tsunami that occurred in asia in  hurricane katrina and the earthquake in sichuan have increased awareness of the utility of imagery information products for humanitarian missions 
commercial demand for geospatial technologies is growing 
according to an industry study  the commercial market for imagery better than three meter ground resolution from high resolution imaging satellites is expected to grow over the next few years 
we believe that growth will be fueled in part by the broad awareness created by the on line mapping search engines such as google earth tm and microsoft virtual earth tm 
consumers are beginning to utilize location based technologies for everything from navigation to social networking 
the convergence of imagery with gps and personal navigation devices  combined with inexpensive access to broad band communications networks  appears to have generated a development of new applications incorporating imagery and imagery information products 
our technology is well suited for infrastructure project management 
both satellite and aerial imagery  along with other location based technologies  can help the us achieve its infrastructure goals more efficiently and cost effectively since every infrastructure project has a reference to a physical location on the surface of the globe 
according to an industry trade group  a significant portion of the new stimulus programs proposed by the current us administration will require geospatial data or services  particularly in the areas of design and planning for infrastructure projects  wildfire mapping  environmental infrastructure projects  surveying and charting and improvements to airports 
we believe the heightened focus on the global environment could increase use of imagery for global observation to support climate change initiatives or to verify or monitor carbon reduction projects established through legislation or done voluntarily 
rapid advancements in it infrastructure capabilities such as cloud computing  mobile communications and broadband may have dramatic effects on the industry 
while digital information  including satellite imagery and products  is easily distributed to customers over the internet  there is increasing customer interest in having others host imagery for them while adding value to it in a service oriented environment 
as a result  we anticipate growth in the increasing use of cloud computing where data and applications reside in cyberspace rather than on company servers or hard drives 
the nga s new sla is an example of how agencies may utilize geospatial technology rather than just buying imagery pixels by the square kilometer 
there are also some negative industry trends the us government may build and launch its own classified satellite imaging program and produce imagery similar to that currently provided by commercial data providers 
while the last two administrations in the us developed commercial remote sensing policies that are favorable for the commercial satellite imagery industry  the intelligence community may make efforts to fund satellite systems that could compete with the commercial data providers 
the current economic demands on the us government resources and the inherent time it takes to design and deploy new imagery satellite systems may mitigate any near term impact should the government decide to develop competing assets 
however  we continue to monitor for any evolution in the us government s policy toward commercial imagery providers 
more countries are increasingly interested in building and launching their own imaging systems 
according to a noaa study in october  more than two dozen countries are or will be operating earth imaging satellites within the next few years 
while none of these imaging systems can currently match the resolution and accuracy of us commercial systems  several countries are planning to launch systems with capabilities similar to our imaging assets 
the development and launch of such systems does involve significant risk and uncertainty  including technological  launch and financing risk 
we are mindful of this trend as we consider how best to grow our business 
the us government is increasingly using other sensors such as unmanned aerial vehicles for more persistent surveillance 
while these systems are mainly used for tactical intelligence collection  they provide commanders with visibility over an area of interest on a more sustained basis 
we believe that our imagery and products will remain an important element in fulfilling the us government s broad imagery needs in both tactical and non mission critical situations 
while not new  the us government continues to place onerous restrictions on the export of space components to all countries 
the international traffic in arms regulations created a decade ago to ensure us space technology does not fall in the wrong hands  has  in effect  hampered us competitiveness overseas 
such strict government licensing restricts exchange of technical data and export of commercial remote sensing hardware  such as ground stations  thereby encouraging development of foreign manufacturing capability 
because of itar  us sales of earth observation satellite systems overseas is virtually non existent 
we are mindful of overall market trends and the pressure on defense and intelligence budgets 
while our satellite imagery business is somewhat insulated from the general economic downturn because we provide crucial information to defense and intelligence agencies around the world  economic conditions at the state and local level could affect mj harden  and it may be harder to penetrate new markets  especially on the commercial side

in the second quarter of  we completed an updated analysis of our tax accounting methods  and we discovered that we had incorrectly excluded from taxable income million of cost share payments received through from the us government under the nextview program 
for financial reporting purposes  we will continue to recognize these cost share payments as deferred revenue

in interest expense  we recorded an unrealized loss on this derivative instrument of million for the year ended december  and an unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is defined as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and  as presented below  represents our company s net earnings or loss adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization expenses  net interest income or expense  income tax expense benefit  non cash loss on inventory and investment impairments and non cash stock compensation expense 
we present adjusted ebitda to enhance understanding our operating performance 
we use adjusted ebitda as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is an operating performance measure  and not a liquidity measure  that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies 
however  adjusted ebitda is not a recognized term under financial performance under gaap  and our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of our operating performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of cash flows  or as a measure of liquidity 
there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures  including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours 
a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted ebitda is as follows in thousands for the year ended december  as restated as restated net earnings add interest expense  net benefit provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization non cash loss on inventory and investment impairments non cash stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources as restated as restated in thousands  except ratios december cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments working capital current ratio year ended december operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above the company s principal sources of liquidity are its cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
our primary cash needs are for working capital  capital expenditures and debt service 
we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
however  our ability to continue to be profitable and generate positive cash flow through our operations beyond that period is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control and dependent on the continued expansion of commercial services  adequate customer acceptance of our products and services and numerous other factors 
to the extent that we sign a contract to construct our next generation satellite  geoeye  we would require substantial additional capital resources 
as described more fully above in overview impact of significant transactions geoeye  we expect to contract with a satellite builder in  although the timing may vary depending on our perception of the market potential and the current state of the financial markets 
we will evaluate our options for financing the construction of geoeye in conjunction with the selection of the satellite builder 
cash flow items net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  net earnings  after adjustments for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  changes in fair value of derivative instruments  asset impairment  deferred income taxes  and stock compensation  was million 
changes in working capital used million of cash  with most of that attributable to a million decrease in the current income tax payable  a million decrease in non current income tax reserve  a million increase in current assets  and a million increase in other assets offset by a million increase in deferred revenue and a million decrease in accounts payable and current liabilities 
the deferred revenue balance principally represents milestone payments received from or invoiced to nga for the nextview program through december in  net earnings  after adjustments for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  changes in fair value of derivative instruments  deferred income taxes  and stock compensation  was million 
changes in working capital provided million of cash  with most of that attributable to a million increase in the current income tax payable a million increase in non current income tax reserve a million increase in deferred revenue and a million decrease in other assets offset by a million increase in current assets  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in non current liabilities 
the deferred revenue balance principally represents milestone payments received from nga for the nextview program through december net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in these increased cash outflows were primarily attributable to expenditures related to the construction of geoeye and its related ground system assets 
however  million of capital expenditures in was attributable to costs incurred for the construction of geoeye during  we received million of proceeds from insurance for the loss of the orbview satellite 
in addition  during  we used million of cash to purchase the mj harden operations 
this partially offset million in capital expenditure in  primarily related to the construction of the geoeye satellite 
net cash used in or provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in and was related to the issuances of common stock related to stock options and warrants exercised 
in  net cash used in financing activities was million 
the funds were primarily used to repay the remaining million balance on the debt incurred to purchase the space imaging operations in the first quarter of the funds were offset by cash provided in the amount of million for the issuance of common stock related to stock options and warrants exercised 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
approximately million is committed for payments to subcontractors under the nextview program 
our performance under the nextview program required significant capital expenditures to complete the development  manufacture and launch of the geoeye satellite 
we have funded our non nextview capital expenditures with cash flows from operating activities using cash on hand and revenues from existing contracts 
our total long term debt consists of million of senior secured floating rate notes  net of unamortized discount of million  at december  we have reevaluated our tax accounting method for the cost share payments received from nga for the design  construction and commissioning of geoeye originally  we believed it was appropriate to recognize for tax purposes the cost share payments over a year period following the commissioning of geoeye  which is the method that will be used to recognize the cost share payments for financial reporting purposes 
upon reevaluation  we determined that these payments should have been recognized  for tax purposes  as income in the year that the company was entitled to receive them 
after this determination  we submitted an application with the irs on august  to change our accounting method for these payments and will now recognize the payments  for tax purposes  over the next four years  which began in the third quarter the amount of tax liability on these payments remains unchanged 
however  with the change in accounting method  the timing has changed 
this will result in higher than previously anticipated taxable income in the four year period starting in but will be mostly offset by the accelerated tax depreciation of geoeye in those same years  but differences exist in the periods and methods used for recognition 
the related liability has been placed on the balance sheet with a corresponding offset to a deferred tax asset 
the amount of actual income taxes to be paid over the next four years will be based on the calculation of our annual taxable income  which will include for  the recognition into taxable income of the cost share payments invoiced in  for each year to  the recognition into taxable income of one fourth of the prior cost share payments  and all other taxable income from operations net of associated expenses including accelerated depreciation for tax purposes 
based on expected significant tax deductions from accelerated tax depreciation of geoeye  beginning in and extending over the next several years  we believe that the tax deductions will mostly offset the effect of the increase in taxable income from the cost share payments  but differences exist in the periods and methods used for recognition 
the total project cost including financing and launch insurance costs to bring the geoeye satellite into service is expected to be approximately million 
we spent approximately million under the program through december  in october  we announced that we had entered into a contract with itt corporation to begin work on the camera for our next earth imaging satellite  geoeye as described more fully above in overview impact of significant transactions geoeye  we expect to contract with a satellite builder in  although the timing may vary depending on our perception of the market potential and the current state of the financial markets 
we will evaluate our options for financing the construction of geoeye in conjunction with the selection of the satellite builder 
long term debt as of december   our total long term debt consisted of million of notes 
under the indenture governing the notes  we are prohibited from paying dividends until the principal amount of all such notes has been repaid 
we may redeem the notes beginning in january the notes may be redeemed at of par for the first twelve month period  at of par for the next twelve month period  and at par thereafter 
the indenture governing our notes contains a covenant that restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness unless  among other things  we can comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we may incur additional indebtedness only if  after giving pro forma effect to that incurrence  our ratio of adjusted ebitda to total consolidated debt less cash on hand for the four fiscal quarters ending as of the most recent date for which internal financial statements are available meet certain levels or we have availability to incur such indebtedness under certain baskets in the indenture 
the notes bear interest at a rate per annum  reset semi annually  equal to the greater of six month libor or  plus a margin of  which was at december  in february  we entered into a million interest rate cap agreement intended to protect us from rises in interest rates by limiting our interest rate exposure to the three month libor with a cap of 
the cap was effective july  and terminates january  the cap agreement cost was million 
funding sources and uses we completed the construction of and launched geoeye in contractual provisions allowed us to hold back million due to our contractors 
those remaining amounts will be paid in we also continued construction of geoeye contracted backlog we have historically had and currently have a substantial backlog  which provides some assurance regarding our future revenue expectations 
backlog reduces the volatility of our net cash provided by operating activities more than would be typical for a company outside our industry 
our backlog was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  backlog includes our sla with the nga  access fee agreements with our international regional affiliates  regional affiliate ground station operations and maintenance contracts  commercial imagery contracts and value added products and services 
our backlog as of december  included approximately million of contracts with the us government  including approximately related specifically to the sla 
most of our government contracts are funded incrementally on a year to year basis  however  certain foreign government customers have signed multi year access fee and operating and maintenance contracts 
changes in government policies  priorities or funding levels through agency or program budget reductions by the us congress or executive agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  contracts with the us government may be terminated or suspended by the us government at any time  with or without cause  which could result in a reduction in backlog 
capital expenditures for  our capital expenditures included million for satellites and ground systems and million for property  plant and equipment 
we currently expect our total capital expenditures to range from approximately million to million 
the indenture governing our notes contains a covenant that restricts our ability to use cash flow from certain subsidiaries to incur capital expenditures that are not related to geoeye we may freely use cash flow from subsidiaries not restricted by the indenture to incur capital expenditures that are not related to geoeye the capital expenditures for the restricted group of subsidiaries will not exceed the limits set in the indenture 
we intend to fund our capital expenditure requirements through cash on hand  cash provided from operating activities and  if necessary  additional borrowings or funding from a customer or customers 
to the extent that we sign a contract for the construction of the geoeye satellite  we would expect to incur additional capital expenditures in excess of cash on hand and cash provided from operating activities in and beyond 
the timing of the geoeye program may vary depending on our perception of the market potential  especially the potential interest from the us government 
in light of the significant capital required to build geoeye and the current state of the financial markets  timing may also vary subject to our ability to raise the necessary capital on terms which we deem to be acceptable 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease various real properties under operating leases that generally require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance and minimum lease payments 
some of our leases have options to renew 
we do not have any other significant off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations  as of december  payments due by year and contractual obligations thereafter total in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations interest expense on long term debt total contractual obligations represents contractual interest payment obligations on the million outstanding principal balance of our notes  which bear interest at a rate per annum  reset semi annually  equal to the greater of six month libor or  plus a margin of  which was at december  operating leases we have commitments for operating leases primarily relating to equipment and office and operating facilities 
these leases contain escalation provisions for increases as a result of increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses 
as of december   minimum annual rentals of all leases  exclusive of potential increases in real estate taxes  operating assessments and future sub lease income  totaled approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preceding discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on geoeye s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  revenue recognition  business combinations  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
geoeye believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are from imaging services  the sale of satellite imagery directly to end users or value added resellers and the provision of direct access to our satellites and associated ground processing technology upgrades and operations and maintenance services 
we also derive significant revenue from value added production services where we combine our images with data and imagery from our own and other sources to create sophisticated information products 
we enter into fixed price  unit price and time and materials contracts with our customers 
for revenue recognition  we follow the guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants sop  and emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf we consider the nature of our contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for certain sales transactions that involve multiple element arrangements 
we record revenues from the sale of satellite imagery directly to end users or value added resellers based on the delivery of the imagery 
we recognize revenues for the provision of direct access to our satellites on a straight line basis over the delivery term of the contract 
we recognize revenues for the sale of ground processing technology upgrades and support services based on the delivery of these products and services 
if the satellite access service is combined with the sale of ground processing technology upgrades and operations and maintenance services and the requirements for separate revenue recognition are not met  we recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the combined delivery term of the services 
revenue is recognized on contracts to provide value added production services using the percentage of completion method whereby revenue is recognized on each production contract based either on the contract price of units of production delivered during a period or upon costs to date plus an estimate of gross profit to date 
anticipated contract losses are recognized as they become known 
under the units of delivery method  revenue on a contract is recorded as the units are delivered and accepted during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units 
contract costs are recognized as incurred  with costs to date of unfinished production for which revenue has not been recognized being capitalized 
under the cost plus gross profit earned method  progress toward completion is measured against all measurable deliverables based on either resources applied or cost incurred compared to total resources or cost projected for the project 
we recognize costs as incurred 
profit is determined based on our estimated profit on the contract multiplied by our progress toward completion 
revenue represents the sum of our costs and profit on the contract for the period 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on the company s best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the company s contracts 
we review our contract estimates on a continual basis to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion 
at times we may receive payments from some customers in advance of providing services 
amounts received from customers pursuant to satellite access prepayment options are recorded in the consolidated financial statements as deferred revenue 
theses deferred amounts are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the agreement terms 
in addition  our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether the collection is reasonably assured  which requires us  among other things  to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in judgments in these assumptions and estimates could materially impact the timing and or amount of revenue recognition 
business combinations our business combinations have been accounted for in accordance with the provisions set forth in sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date 
the portion of the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves estimates and judgments by our management that may be adjusted during the allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
these allocations are made based on management s best estimates and assumptions 
satellites and related ground systems satellites and related ground systems are recorded at cost 
pursuant to sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  the cost of our satellite includes capitalized interest cost incurred during the construction and development period 
in addition  capitalized costs of our satellite and related ground systems include internal direct labor costs incurred in the construction and development  as well as depreciation costs related to assets which support the construction and development of our satellite and related ground systems 
while under construction  the costs of our satellites are capitalized during the construction phase  assuming the eventual successful launch and in orbit operation of the satellite 
the portion of any insurance premiums associated with the insurance coverage of the launch and on orbit commissioning period prior to a satellite reaching start of commercial operations  are capitalized in the original cost of the satellite and are amortized over the estimated life of the asset 
ground systems are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use 
if a satellite were to fail during launch or while in orbit  the resulting loss would be charged to expense in the period in which such loss were to occur 
the amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance proceeds received as a result of the launch or in orbit failure 
asset impairment assessments goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the use of fair value in determining the amount of impairment  if any  for recorded goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we calculate the fair market value at the company level  which is the sole reporting unit  using a discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the fair market value  impairment is measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
an impairment test was performed on recorded goodwill and it was determined that no impairments existed as of december  long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of our satellites  fixed assets and other long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that certain long lived fixed assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
estimated future cash flows could be impacted by  among other things  changes in estimates of the useful lives of the assets eg  degradation in the quality of images downloaded from the satellite  changes in estimates of our ability to operate the assets at expected levels eg  due to intermittent loss of satellite transmissions and by the loss of one or several significant customer contracts 
satellites and other property and equipment are depreciated and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we estimate the useful lives of our satellites for depreciation purposes based upon an analysis of each satellite s performance  including its orbital design life and its estimated service life 
the orbital design life of a satellite is the length of time that the manufacturer has contractually committed that the satellite s hardware will remain operational under normal operating conditions 
in contrast  a satellite s service life is the length of time the satellite is expected to remain operational as determined by remaining fuel levels and consumption rates 
our in orbit satellites generally have orbital design lives ranging from seven to seven and a half years and service lives as high as ten years 
the useful depreciable lives of our satellites are generally the orbital design lives 
although the service lives of our satellites have historically extended beyond their depreciable lives  this trend may not continue 
we periodically review the remaining estimated useful lives of our satellites to determine if any revisions to our estimates are necessary based on the health of the individual satellites 
changes in our estimate of the useful lives of our satellites could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we charge to operations the carrying value of any satellite lost as a result of a launch or in orbit failure upon the occurrence of the loss 
in the event of a partial failure  we record an impairment charge to operations upon the occurrence of the loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the satellite 
we measure the impairment charge as the excess of the carrying value of the satellite over its estimated fair value as determined by the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we reduce the charge to operations resulting from either a complete or a partial failure by the amount of any insurance proceeds that were either due and payable to or received by us  and by the amount of any deferred satellite performance incentives that are no longer applicable following the failure 
income taxes income tax provision is based on income before taxes and is computed using the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates projected to be in effect for the year in which the difference is expected to reverse 
significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of our deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense and net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
as part of our financial process  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based in part on the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to realize the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we have made significant estimates involving current and deferred income taxes  tax attributes relating to the interpretation of various tax laws  historical bases of tax attributes associated with certain tangible and intangible assets and limitations surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is deemed more likely than not that certain tax positions will be sustained 
under sfas  a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and  if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  we evaluate our tax positions to determine if it is more likely than not that a tax position is sustainable  based solely on its technical merits and presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and having access to all relevant facts and information 
when a tax position does not meet the more likely than not standard  a liability is recorded for the entire amount of the unrecognized tax benefit 
additionally  for those tax positions that are determined more likely than not to be sustainable  we measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit more likely than not determined by cumulative probability to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority 
stock based compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the employee stock award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period in a manner similar to other forms of compensation paid to employees 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the award 
there is limited historical information available to support our estimate of certain assumptions required to value our stock options 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we consider the vesting period for the award  our recent historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures and the expected volatility 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change

 accounting for defensive intangible assets eitf 
eitf requires that a defensive intangible asset be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting and assigned a useful life which reflects the entity s consumption of the expected benefits related to that asset 
a defensive intangible asset is an acquired intangible asset which the acquirer does not intend to actively use  but intends to hold to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset  excluding intangible assets that are used in research and development 
under eitf  an entity s benefit from holding a defensive intangible asset is the direct and indirect cash flows resulting from the entity preventing others from realizing any value from the intangible assets 
the period over which a defensive asset diminishes in fair value can be used as a proxy for the entity s consumption of the expected benefits related to the asset 
eitf is effective for defensive intangible assets acquired on or after january  we will adopt eitf upon its effective date as appropriate for any future defensive intangible assets acquired

quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risk our primary exposure to market risk relates to interest rates 
the financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk principally are limited to the notes 
the notes are subject to interest rate fluctuation because the interest rate resets semi annually for the term of the notes
