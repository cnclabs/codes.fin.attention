item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview we believe that coast is one of the largest wholesale suppliers of replacement parts  supplies and accessories for recreational vehicles rvs and boats in north america 
we supply more than  products and serve more than  customers throughout the united states and canada  from regional distribution centers in the united states regional distribution centers in canada 
our sales are made to retail parts and supplies stores  service and repair establishments and new and used rv and boat dealers after market customers 
factors generally affecting sales of rv and boating products our sales are affected primarily by i the usage of rvs and boats by the consumers to whom after market customers sell our products  because such usage affects the consumers needs for and purchases of replacement parts  repair services and supplies  and ii sales of new and used rvs and boats  because consumers often accessorize their rvs and boats at or shortly after the time of purchase 
the usage and the purchase  by consumers  of rvs and boats depend  in large measure  upon the extent of discretionary income available to consumers  their confidence about economic conditions which affects their willingness to use and purchase rvs and boats and the availability and the cost of credit that consumers often use to finance their purchases of rvs and boats 
as a result  recessionary conditions and a tightening in the availability or increases in the costs of borrowings to consumers often lead to declines in the purchase and  to a lesser extent  in the usage  of rvs and boats 
additionally  increase in the prices and shortages in the supply of gasoline can lead to declines in the usage and purchases of rvs and boats  because these conditions increase the consumers costs and the difficulties of using their rvs and boats 
weather conditions also can affect our operating results  because unusually severe or extended winter weather conditions can reduce the usage of rvs and boats for periods extending beyond the ordinary winter months or to regions that ordinarily encounter milder winter weather conditions and can cause period to period fluctuations in our sales and financial performance 
as a result  our sales and operating results can be  and in the past have been  affected by recessionary economic conditions  tightening in the availability and increases in the costs of consumer and business financing  shortages in the supply and increases in the prices of gasoline and unusually adverse weather conditions

overview of fiscal operating results the following table provides information comparing our results of operations in the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operation in fiscal and fiscal dollars are in thousands  except per share data 
year ended december  increase decrease vs 
increase decrease vs 
amount amount amount amount percent amount percent net sales gross profits selling  general administrative expenses operating income loss interest expense earnings loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net earnings loss net earnings loss per share diluted as the above table indicates  we incurred a loss from operations of million and a net loss of million in fiscal those losses were due primarily to the worsening of the economic recession and the credit crisis in the united states during the second half of  which adversely affected our net sales and our gross profits and more than offset costs savings we realized as a result of a cost reduction program we implemented beginning in the third quarter of in response to these conditions 
set forth below is a summary of the conditions and circumstances that led to the operating loss and net loss we incurred in decrease in net sales 
net sales declined by million  or  in as compared to  primarily as a result of reductions in purchases and in the usage by consumers of rvs and boats and  therefore  in their need for and their purchases of the products we sell  due to the worsening of the economic recession and a credit crisis that significantly reduced the availability of consumer credit 
these conditions led to i a significant reduction in economic activity  ii sharp declines in the value of residential real estate which wiped out a substantial amount of the equity that many consumers had in their homes  iii sharp and rapid increases in unemployment  iv decreases in discretionary income  and v steep and rapid decreases in stock and bond prices which significantly reduced the retirement savings of many consumers  all of which combined to cause a significant decline in the confidence of consumers not only about the economy in general  but also about their own financial security and futures and led them to significantly curtail their spending  particularly during the second half of also contributing to the decline in our net sales were sharp increases in gasoline prices  which affected the willingness of consumers to use their rvs and boats particularly during the second and third quarters of 
table of contents gross margin and gross profits 
we were able to maintain our gross margin in at  down only slightly from in  primarily as a result of i price increases implemented on selected products  ii the strengthening of the canadian dollar during the first half of  which enabled our canadian subsidiary  which purchases products from suppliers in the united states  to improve its margins during that period  iii a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of higher margin products sourced from asia and iv reductions in warehouse labor and other distribution costs 
nevertheless  gross profits declined by million  or  in  as compared to  due primarily to the decline in net sales in operating expenses 
we implemented a program to reduce not only warehouse and other distribution costs  but also selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  beginning in the third quarter of  when it became apparent that the economic recession had become more severe and would continue well into among other things  we implemented staff reductions and a across the board reduction in executive and management salaries 
as a result  we were able to reduce sg a expenses by million  or  in  as compared to however  those costs savings were more than offset by the decrease in net sales and  as a result  as a percentage of net sales  such expenses increased to in from in income tax benefit 
our net loss for reflects an income tax benefit of nearly million  which resulted primarily from the pre tax loss incurred in the amount of that income tax benefit was net of a non cash charge recognized to establish a valuation allowance to reduce the amount of our deferred tax asset on our balance sheet which consists of tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions that are available to reduce taxes on income we generate in future years to the amount of such income tax benefits we believe is fully realizable 
see critical accounting policies and use of estimates our critical accounting policies deferred tax asset and valuation allowance in this section below 
outlook for the continued lack of available consumer and business credit and the worsening of and concerns and uncertainties among businesses and consumers regarding the ultimate severity and duration of the economic recession  have continued into we expect these economic and other conditions to continue to adversely affect the purchase and usage by consumers of rvs and boats and  therefore  their need for and purchases of the products that we sell  during moreover  in the past few months  the canadian dollar has weakened against the us dollar  as canada is also suffering through an economic recession and  as a result  our canadian subsidiary is experiencing increases in its costs of products sold  thereby adversely affecting our consolidated operating results 
in addition  our bank loan agreement was recently amended  largely due to the tightening of available business credit and the impact of the economic recession on our operating results 
that amendment reduces the maximum amount of borrowings we can obtain under our revolving bank credit line and increases the costs to us of such borrowings 
these amendments also may adversely affect our net sales because we may not be able to purchase as much inventory of the products we sell  which could adversely affect our service levels to our customers  and we may have to tighten the credit that we can extend to our customers in connection with their purchases of products from us 

table of contents our strategic goals for are to capture additional market share in order to offset declines in net sales attributable to these difficult economic conditions  and to improve our gross margin  despite these conditions  primarily by continuing to increase our sales of proprietary products and other foreign sourced products 
in addition  in response to this difficult economic climate  we are continuing to reduce our sg a expenses by implementing additional staff reductions and negotiating price concessions from our suppliers 
as a result  we believe that we can achieve a modest improvement in our operating results in  as compared to  assuming that economic and market conditions in the united states and canada stabilize and the availability of credit to businesses and consumers increases 
on the other hand  if such conditions do not begin to improve in  it may become necessary for us to take additional cost cutting measures  which could include the closing of one or more of our distribution centers 
however  due to the risks in the economy and in our business and the uncertainties that exist regarding future economic and market conditions  it is not possible to predict with any degree of accuracy whether we will succeed in achieving our goals for see risk factors in item a of part i of this report for a discussion of some of those risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates general in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we record most of our assets at the lower of cost or fair value 
in the case of some of our assets  principally accounts receivable  inventories and deferred income taxes  we make adjustments to their cost or fair values to arrive at what we expect to be able to collect on outstanding accounts receivables  the amounts for which we expect to be able to sell our inventories and the amount of available tax loss and credit carryforwards and deductions that we will be able to use to reduce our future income tax liability 
those adjustments are made on the basis of a number of different factors  including judgments or assumptions we make regarding economic and market conditions and trends and their impact on our financial performance  and those judgments and assumptions are  in turn  based on current information available to us 
if those conditions or trends were to change in ways that we did not expect  then based on our assessment of how those changes will affect the prospects for realizing the values at which we have recorded these assets  we may be required  pursuant to gaap  to further adjust the carrying values at which we record these assets for financial reporting purposes 
any resulting downward adjustments are commonly referred to as write downs of the assets affected by the changed conditions 
it is our practice to establish reserves or allowances against which we are able to charge any such downward adjustments or write downs to these assets 
examples include an allowance established for uncollectible accounts receivable sometimes referred to as bad debt reserves  an allowance for inventory obsolescence and a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset to the extent necessary to reduce its carrying value to the amount of that asset that we believe we are likely to be able to use to reduce our income tax liability in future periods 
the amounts at which those allowances are established and maintained are based on our historical experience and also on our assumptions and judgments about economic or market conditions or trends and any other factors that could affect the values at which we had recorded such assets 
those allowances are periodically increased to replenish the allowances following write downs of uncollectible accounts or to take account of increased risks due to changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
increases in the allowances are effectuated by charges to income or increases in expense in our statement of operations in the periods when those allowances are increased 
as a result  our judgments or assumptions about market and economic conditions or trends and about their effects on our financial performance can and will affect not only the amounts at which we record these assets on our balance sheet  but also our results of operations 
the decisions as to the timing of i adjustments or write downs of this nature and ii the increases we make to our reserves  also require subjective evaluations or assessments about the effects and duration of changes in economic or market conditions or trends 
for example  it is difficult to predict whether events or changes in economic or market conditions  such as economic slowdowns or a recession  or increasing gasoline prices or interest rates  will be of short or long term duration  and it is not uncommon for it to take some time after the onset of such changes for their full effects on our business to be recognized 
therefore  management makes such estimates based upon the information available at that time and reevaluates and adjusts its reserves and allowances for potential write downs on a quarterly basis 
under gaap  most businesses also must make estimates or judgments regarding the periods during which sales are recorded and also the amounts at which they are recorded 
those estimates and judgments will depend on such factors as the steps or actions that a business must take to complete a sale of products to or to perform services for a customer and the circumstances under which a customer would be entitled to return the products or reject or adjust the payment for the services rendered to it 
additionally  in the case of a business that grants its customers contractual rights to return products sold to them  gaap requires that a reserve or allowance be established for product returns by 
table of contents means of a reduction in the amount at which its sales are recorded based primarily on the nature  extensiveness and duration of those rights and historical return experience 
in making our estimates and assumptions we follow gaap and accounting practices applicable to our business that we believe will enable us to make fair and consistent estimates of the carrying value of those assets and to establish adequate reserves or allowances for downward adjustments in those values that we may have to make in future periods 
our critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are material to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations that are discussed below 
revenue recognition and the allowance for product returns 
we recognize revenue from the sale of a product upon its shipment to the customer 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are included in revenue in accordance with eitf no 
we provide our customers with limited rights to return products that we sell to them 
we establish an allowance for potential returns that reduces the amounts of our reported sales 
we estimate the allowance based on historical experience with returns of like products and current economic and market conditions and trends  which can affect the level at which customers submit product returns 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the normal course of our business we extend day payment terms to our customers and  due to the seasonality of our business  during late fall and winter we sometimes grant payment terms of longer duration to those of our customers that have good credit records 
we regularly review our customers accounts and estimate the amount of  and establish an allowance for  uncollectible amounts or receivables in each reporting period 
the amount of the allowance is based on several factors  including the age of unpaid amounts  a review of significant past due accounts  and current economic and market trends that can affect the ability of customers to keep their accounts current 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are reviewed periodically to determine if the allowance should be increased  and any increases are recorded in the accounting period in which the events that require such increases become known 
for example  if the financial condition of some of our customers or economic or market conditions were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis  increases in the allowance may be required 
since the allowance is increased or replenished by recording a charge which is included in  and has the effect of increasing  selling  general and administrative expenses  an increase in the allowance will reduce income in the period when the increase is recorded 
inventory and reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory 
we are a wholesale distributor  and not a manufacturer of products and  therefore  all of our inventory consists of finished goods 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and that value is reduced by an allowance for excess and slowing moving or obsolete inventories 
the amount of the allowance is determined on the basis of historical experience with different product lines  estimates or assumptions concerning future economic and market conditions and estimates of future sales 
if there is an economic downturn or a decline in sales  causing inventories of some product lines to accumulate  it may become necessary to increase the allowance 
other factors that can require increases in the allowance or inventory write downs are reductions in pricing or introduction of new or competitive products by manufacturers  however  due to the relative maturity of the markets in which the company operates  usually these are not significant factors 
increases in this allowance also will cause a decline in operating results as such increases are effectuated by charges against income 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory declined in absolute dollars to  at december  from  at december  however  the reserves at december  grew as a percentage of total inventories to approximately from approximately at december  as a result of i a decrease in our total inventories to million at december  from million at december  and ii a decision to leave the reserves substantially unchanged despite that decrease due primarily to the economic recession and the credit crisis which have led to lower demand for and a slowing of sales of the products we sell 
deferred tax asset and valuation allowance 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions tax benefits that are available to us to offset or reduce our income tax liability in future periods 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  such tax benefits will expire if not used within specified periods of time to reduce income taxes on taxable income that 
table of contents we generate during those periods 
accordingly  the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset depends on the amount of taxable income that we are able to generate during those time periods 
at least once each year  we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods 
if we conclude  on the basis of those estimates and the aggregate amount of the tax benefits available to us  that it is more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration  we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet 
on the other hand  if we conclude on the basis of those estimates and the aggregate amount of the tax benefits available to us that it is more likely that than not that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in their entirety prior to their expiration  then  we would establish or increase any existing valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount that we believe we will be able to utilize  by recognizing a non cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision  or reducing any credit  for income taxes that would be recorded in our statement of operations 
during we became eligible for a targeted jobs tax credit that had the effect of significantly increasing the amount of our deferred tax asset 
due primarily to that increase in tax benefits  however  we determined that as of december  it was no longer more likely than not that we would be able to fully utilize our deferred tax asset 
accordingly  at december  we established a valuation allowance primarily related to a targeted jobs tax credit to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to approximately million 
long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment at least annually or if and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any of those assets may not be recoverable in full  based on standards established by sfas no 
 by comparing the fair value of the long lived asset to its carrying amount 
foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period 
revenues and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the reporting period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses not impacting cash flows are credited to or charged against other comprehensive earnings 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
stock based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement sfas r  share based payment sfas r effective on january  this statement establishes accounting standards for recording in a company s financial statements transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
in the case of the company  sfas r applies primarily to transactions in which we obtain employee services for share based payments  such as the options issued under our stock incentive plans 
sfas r provides for  and we elected to adopt  the modified prospective method for applying sfas r 
under that method  we began recognizing compensation costs on january  for the fair value of i all share based award grants made on or after such date  and ii the portion of pre existing awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of january   in each case based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas r for pro forma disclosures 
our stock option compensation expense in the years ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
warranty costs 
we generally do not independently warrant the products that we distribute 
instead  the manufacturers of the products that we distribute warrant the products and allow us to return defective products  including those that have been returned to us by our customers 
however  we began selling a line of portable and standby generators under a product supply arrangement which obligates us to provide warranty services for these products and to share the costs of providing those services with the manufacturer 
the duration of the warranty period for these products is months following the sale of the product to a retail customer 
we established warranty reserves for these products of  and  at december  and  respectively 
in the event that the assumptions or estimates on which the amount of the reserves were determined later prove to be incorrect due to increases in the number or the dollar amounts of the warranty claims we receive  it could become necessary for us to increase the reserve by means of a charge to our income 
increases in sales of these products in the future also may require us to increase our warranty reserve from time to time 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities 
the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas on january  sfas applies primarily to financial assets and liabilities that are measured and reported on a fair value basis 
it requires new disclosures regarding those fair value measurements that are designed to enable the reader of financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine 
table of contents fair values 
more specifically  sfas requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data  and level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
in february  the fasb issued fsp  which delayed the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities other than those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually until  in the case of the company  january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position or results of our operations 
the following table summarizes  as of december   the fair value measurement in thousands of dollars  in accordance with sfas  of our financial assets  which consisted of a derivative instrument which we purchased to hedge our foreign currency risk in canada at december  total quoted market prices in active markets level significant other observable inputs level derivative asset we used the income approach to value this financial instrument  using observable level market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single discounted present amount  using the assumption that participants are motivated but not compelled to transact 
level inputs are limited to quoted prices that are observable for the asset and liabilities  which include interest rate and credit risk 
we have used mid market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value measurements 
key inputs for this currency derivative are the spot rate  option strike  interest rates  volatilities  and credit derivative markets 
the spot rate for each currency is the same spot rate used for all balance sheet currency translations at the measurement date and were sourced from the wall street journal 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option of financial assets and liabilities sfas 
sfas provides entities with the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
business entities adopting sfas will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date on items for which fair value option has been elected 
sfas established presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas requires additional information that will help investors and other financial statements users to understand the effect of an entity s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  although the company has adopted sfas  it has not elected to have any financial assets or liabilities presented or disclosed under the fair value option 
in april  the fasb issued fsp this guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas  and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r when the underlying arrangement includes renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon renewal or extension 
companies estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension as adjusted for sfas s entity specific factors 
fsp is effective for us beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of fsp to be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

r also will change the accounting treatment and disclosures for certain specific items in a business combination 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas no 
r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions effectuated after its effective date 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

this statement will require enhanced disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
management is currently assessing any impact that adoption of sfas may have on our financial results 
in june  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp on the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  fsp eitf

the following table sets forth certain information regarding the decreases in our net sales in fiscal and dollars in the table are in thousands 
change vs 
change vs 
the decline in net sales in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to worsening of the economic recession and the tightening in the availability of credit and the steep and rapid decline in stock and bond market prices  which significantly reduced the retirement savings of so called baby boomers that are most likely to purchase and use rvs and boats 
these conditions led consumers to curtail both their purchases and usage of rvs and boats which had the effect of reducing the demand for and sales of the products we sell 
higher gasoline prices during the first eight months of also contributed to the reductions in the usage of rvs and boats and  therefore  to the decline in our net sales in the decline in net sales in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to an industry wide decline in the purchase and usage of rvs and boats by consumers and the consequent decline in sales of the rv and boating products we sell 
we believe that this decline was primarily attributable to higher gasoline prices and  to a lesser extent  a tightening of available financing for the purchase of rvs and boats and uncertainties and concerns about the direction of the economy  particularly during the fourth quarter of  which led consumers to begin curtailing their discretionary spending 
gross margin gross profit is calculated by subtracting the costs of sales from net sales 
costs of sales consist primarily of the amounts paid to manufacturers and suppliers for the products that we purchase for resale  inbound freight charges  merchandise receiving  handling and storage costs  and out bound freight charges 
gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage of net sales 
dollars in thousands gross profit gross margin due to the worsening of the economic recession and its impact on our sales revenues  gross profits declined by million or in  as compared to notwithstanding that decline  however  we were still able to maintain our gross margin at in  almost unchanged from our gross margin in each of the prior two years  as a result of i price increases that we implemented on selected products  ii a change in the mix of products sold to a greater proportion of higher margin products sourced primarily from asia and iii the strengthening of the canadian dollar  which enabled our canadian subsidiary  which purchases products from suppliers in the united states  to improve its margins during the first three quarters of during the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of  the canadian dollar has declined in value in relation to the us dollar and  as a result  during those periods we have experienced a decline in the gross margin and gross profits generated by our canadian subsidiary 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing costs  selling and administrative labor and other administrative costs  professional fees  insurance and the provision made for uncollectible accounts 

table of contents year ended december  dollars in thousands sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales our sg a expenses decreased  in absolute dollars  by  or in as compared to  primarily as a result of a cost reduction program that we commenced in the third quarter of in response to the worsening of the economic recession and credit crisis that resulted in the decline in our sales in pursuant to that program  we made reductions in staffing and reduced salaries  across the board  by 
however  the full effects of these cost reductions will not be fully reflected in our results of operations until as a result  as a percentage of net sales  those expenses rose to in as compared to in in  sg a expenses increased by  or  as compared to  due primarily to increases in labor costs associated with sales  design  engineering and quality control personnel for our proprietary and foreign sourced products 
also contributing to that increase were legal expenses  and expenses relating to the documentation and testing of the company s internal control systems as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which became applicable to the company effective as of december  the majority of our corporate overhead costs are incurred in the united states 
a portion of those costs are allocated to our foreign operations to the extent that they directly benefit from the expenses incurred 
operating income loss year ended december  dollars in thousands operating income loss as a percentage of net sales the loss from operations in was due primarily to the above described declines in net sales and gross profits  which more than offset the reduction in sg a expenses in the decrease in operating income in  as compared to  was due primarily due to the declines in net sales and gross profits  and an increase in sg a expenses 
other income expense year ended december  dollars in thousands other income expense interest expense other income expense total as a percentage of net sales the largest component of other income expense is the interest expense that we incur on borrowings 
to a much lesser extent  other income expense also includes foreign currency gains or losses and gains or losses on disposal of assets 
interest expense decreased by  or  in this decrease was primarily the result of reductions in our average outstanding borrowings and a decrease in the average rate of interest charged on borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit during the interest rate on our bank borrowings is tied to market rates of interest and that interest rate decrease was primarily the result of interest rate reductions implemented by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  which led most banks including our bank lender to reduce their prime interest rates 

table of contents the increase in interest expense in was due primarily to increases in our average outstanding borrowings under our long term revolving credit line and  to a lesser extent  increases during the first half of in prevailing market rates of interest  on which the interest rate on our borrowings is based 
income tax provision benefit year ended december  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit as a percentage of net sales effective tax rate our effective income tax rate is affected primarily by the amount of our expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes  such as stock based compensation expense  and by varying tax rates on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
due to the pre tax loss we incurred in  we recorded a tax credit or benefit of nearly million for  as compared to a provision for income taxes of  for see critical accounting policies and use of estimates our accounting policies deferred tax asset and valuation allowance 
the decrease in the amount of the income tax provision in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to decreases in taxable income in the increase in the effective tax rate in  as compared to  was due to the proportionally higher percentage of non deductible expenses to our pre tax earnings in as compared to liquidity and capital resources working capital  liquidity and cash flows we finance our working capital requirements for our operations primarily with borrowings under a long term revolving line of credit from a bank and internally generated funds 
during  under the terms of the revolving line of credit  we were able to borrow up to the lesser of i  during the period from march through july  and  during the period from august through february  of each year  or ii an amount equal to of eligible accounts receivable and between to of eligible inventory 
during  interest on our borrowings under the revolving line of credit was payable at the bank s prime rate plus or  at the company s option but subject to certain limitations  at libor plus per annum 
the revolving line of credit agreement with the bank contains certain restrictive covenants  including a tangible net worth covenant 
due to the loss we incurred in  we failed to meet that tangible net worth covenant as of december  as a condition to the bank s waiver of the default that would have resulted from such failure  we entered into an agreement with the bank which amended our bank loan agreement 
among other things  in addition to waiving the default of the tangible net worth covenant  that amendment i reduces the maximum amount of our borrowings that may be outstanding at any one time under our revolving credit facility to a maximum of million or of eligible inventory and of eligible accounts receivable  whichever is less  ii provides that the bank may reduce the respective percentages of eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivable that will determine the maximum amount of our borrowings that may be outstanding at any one time under the line of credit  iii substitutes  for the annual tangible net worth covenant  a quarterly pre tax income covenant that will require us to generate profits during at least one quarter of fiscal and to reduce our net loss in as compared to  and iv increases the rate at which interest is payable on borrowings under that credit line from prime plus per annum to prime plus per annum  or libor plus per annum  which will increase our borrowing costs 
the amendment also prohibits us from paying cash dividends or repurchasing our shares 
the maturity date of the line of credit  which is may  remains unchanged 
these amendments will make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures  because we will have less borrowing capacity to meet our working capital requirements in the event that internally generated cash flow declines as a result of the economic recession or other adverse conditions 
in such an event  we could find it necessary to reduce our purchases of inventory and shut down some of our distribution centers  which would adversely affect our results of operations and we may not be able to meet our loan covenants 
see risk factors we rely heavily on bank borrowings in the operation of our business that makes us more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in item a of part i of this report 

table of contents at march   outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility totaled  our bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of our consolidated assets and rank senior in priority to any other indebtedness that the company may incur 
due to the nature of our business  our primary need for working capital is to finance our accounts receivable and our purchases of inventory 
typically we bill our customers on an open account basis with  day  net day terms 
during late fall and in winter  however  we sometimes provide our most creditworthy customers with payment terms of longer duration and  as a result  we generally use a greater proportion of our borrowing availability during the first and fourth quarters of each year than during other parts of the year 
however  the amount of credit we provided to our customers on such extended payment terms declined substantially during the fourth quarter of  as compared to prior years  because customers reduced their product purchases due  we believe  to the effect of the economic recession on their sales and their concerns about how long the economic recession would continue and  therefore  how their sales during the upcoming spring months might be affected 
as a result  we did not have to rely as much on bank borrowings to fund our working capital requirements during the fourth quarter of sources and uses of cash we generally use cash for  rather than generate cash from  operations in the first half of the year  because we build inventories  and accounts receivables increase  as our customers begin increasing their product purchases prior to and in anticipation of the spring and summer selling seasons 
see seasonality and inflation below 
cash provided by operations in during  our operations provided cash of million  comprised of a million reduction in inventory and million reduction in accounts receivable and net of cash used by operations consisting of a million reduction in accounts payable million  a million increase in prepaid expenses  a million increase in deferred taxes  and a net loss of million partially offset by million of non cash operating expenses 
cash used by financing activities in during  we used nearly million of cash for financing activities  consisting of million of cash to fund the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders and million to fund the repayment of long term debt under our revolving bank line of credit 
cash flows used in investing activities in we used million of cash in investing activities in  principally to fund capital expenditures  primarily for warehouse  testing and design and computer equipment 
contractual obligations lease obligations 
we lease our facilities and certain of our equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
in  rent expense under all operating leases totaled approximately  the following table sets forth our future operating lease commitments in thousands of dollars  as of december  year ending december  thereafter total 
table of contents total and maturity of contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth the total and the maturities of our contractual obligations  in thousands of dollars  at december  maturities of contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  total of contractual obligations less than one year more than one and less than four years four to five years more than five years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations under letters of credit totals consists primarily of borrowings under our bank credit facility  which matures in may our long term debt obligations consist primarily of borrowings under our long term revolving bank credit facility 
it is not possible to calculate future estimated interest payments on those borrowing predictably  because the amounts of such borrowings fluctuate throughout the year depending on our liquidity needs  which can vary widely primarily due to the seasonality of our business and the effects of prevailing economic conditions on the demand for and the purchases of our products by customers 
also  the interest rate on those borrowings is determined by reference to the bank s prime rate or libor  which also can and often does fluctuate during the year 
additionally  the formulas for determining the specific interest rate that will apply to such borrowings can change from year to year 
set forth above  under the caption financial condition  liquidity and capital resources are the formulas for determining the interest rates that will apply to those borrowings during the fiscal year ending december  dividend policy and dividend payments 
in the first quarter of  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy that provided for the payment of quarterly cash dividends to our stockholders in the amount of per share  which was increased to per share in in  our board of directors approved a further increase in the quarterly dividend to per share 
in  and we paid total cash dividends of   and  respectively 
in november  our board of directors suspended the payment of cash dividends in order to preserve cash for operations in response to the worsening of the economic recession and the tightening of credit by banks and other lending institutions to businesses  as well as consumers 
additionally  the amendment agreement recently entered into with respect to the terms of the revolving bank line of credit prohibits us from paying cash dividends in the future 
see working capital  liquidity and cash flows above 
as a result  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends at least for the foreseeable future 
share repurchases 
in  our board of directors adopted share repurchase programs authorizing us to repurchase up to an aggregate of  of our shares of common stock in open market or private transactions 
during  and  we made share repurchases pursuant to those programs totaling   and  respectively 
we funded the share repurchases with a combination of internally generated funds and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the amendment agreement recently entered into with respect to the terms of the revolving bank line of credit prohibits us from repurchasing any of our shares in the future 
see working capital  liquidity and cash flows above 
as a result  we do not anticipate resuming purchases of our shares at least for the foreseeable future 
expected uses and sources of funds we expect to make capital expenditures in that we estimate will range from  to  we expect that these expenditures will be of a recurring nature  for such purposes as the replacement and upgrading of warehouse or computer equipment in the ordinary course of our business 
we expect to be able to fund these expenditures and our working capital requirements with borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit and internally generated funds  assuming that there is not a further worsening of the economic recession in see item a above  entitled risk factors our business and financial performance are affected by economic conditions we rely heavily on bank borrowings in the operation of our business  which makes us more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in part i of this report 

table of contents we will continue to explore opportunities to increase our sales and our market share and to improve our profit margins 
we plan to establish new product supply relationships  including relationships that enable us to increase the products that we source from lower cost  but high quality  overseas suppliers  including product suppliers in asia  and to invest in tooling needed for such products 
we also may seek to take advantage of other growth opportunities if and when they may arise 
as a result  we may have occasion in the future to use internally generated funds or bank borrowings for these purposes 
there is no assurance  however  that  if required  we will be able to obtain bank borrowings for these purposes 
seasonality and inflation seasonality 
we generate significantly higher sales during the six month period from march through august  when usage of rvs and boats are at their peak  than we do during the remainder of the year when weather conditions are not optimal for outdoor activities 
because a substantial portion our expenses are fixed  operating income declines and we sometimes incur losses  and must rely more heavily on borrowings to fund operating requirements  during the period from september through february when our sales are lower 
the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the fiscal years ended december  and this information has been prepared by us on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the information includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that management considers necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited quarterly operating results when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
these quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected in future periods

inflation 
generally  we have been able to pass inflationary price increases on to our customers 
however  inflation also may cause or may be accompanied by increases in gasoline prices and interest rates 
such increases  or even the prospect of increases in the price or shortages in the supply of gasoline  can adversely affect the purchase and usage of rvs and boats  which can result in a decline in the demand for our products 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk with respect to financial instruments is primarily related to changes in interest rates with respect to borrowing activities  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
the fair value of borrowings under our revolving credit facility approximates the carrying value of such obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank line of credit of million 
we have substantial sales operations in canada and as a result  our earnings  cash flows and financial position can be affected by movements in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
consequently  we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency fluctuations associated with our canadian operations and our canadian currency denominated debt 
therefore  it is our policy to hedge the net investment of our foreign operations in canada by sometimes purchasing foreign exchange derivatives  such as purchased put option contracts  to mitigate the risk of changes in value of our net investment in our canadian subsidiary that can occur as a result of changes in currency exchange rates 
we account for such derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
as of december  we held foreign currency derivatives maturing in approximately six months 
on the other hand  we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
net investment hedges 
as described above  we hedge certain portions of our net investment in our canadian subsidiary against currency exchange risks and  for that purpose we held derivatives  in the form of foreign currency purchased option contracts  with a notional value of  as of december  we have elected to designate those contracts for special hedge accounting treatment under sfas as net investment hedges 
accordingly  those contracts are held at fair value on our balance sheet with the effective portion of the hedge recorded in accumulative other comprehensive income 
in fiscal  we recorded  in accumulated other comprehensive income in fiscal in respect of the effective portion of that hedge 
there were no material amounts of ineffectiveness recorded during fiscal and the hedge relationship is expected to be highly effective throughout the remaining life of the hedge 
the counterparties associated with those derivative contracts are large creditworthy commercial banking institutions and the derivatives transacted with these institutions are relatively short in duration 
as a result  we do not consider counterparty non performance to be a material risk
