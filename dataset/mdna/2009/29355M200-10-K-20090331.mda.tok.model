item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the matters addressed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may contain certain forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
overview enova systems believes it is a leading supplier of efficient  environmentally friendly digital power components and systems products in conjunction with our associated engineering services 
our core competencies are focused on the development and commercialization of power management and conversion systems for mobile and stationary applications 
enova applies unique enabling technologies in the areas of alternative energy propulsion systems for light and heavy duty vehicles as well as power conditioning and management systems for distributed generation systems 
our products can be found in a variety of oem vehicles including those from hyundai motor company and ford motor company  trucks and buses for first auto works of china  wrightbus and optare plc of the uk and the uk military  as well as digital power systems for edo  hydrogenics and utc fuel cells  a division of united technologies 
we continue to support ic corp 
in their efforts to maximize exposure in the hybrid school bus market 
we have been involved in large shows in albany  ny and reno  nv  chicago  il  washington  dc  smaller venues throughout the midwest as well as in birmingham in the united kingdom 
the exposure via shows and direct interface was aggressively pursued throughout the remainder of  in an effort to promote ic corp 
s production intent for hybrid school buses 
as a result of these continued domestic efforts  the company expanded throughout the north american continent and has delivered hybrid school buses to canada and mexico through ic corp 
some notable highlights of enova s accomplishments in are in cooperation with international truck and engine ic corp  we delivered a plug in hybrid bus to denali national park for use in transporting visitors 
the ic corp bus included our unique post transmission parallel hybrid drive technology 
we believe the utilization of our products in environments such as national parks further demonstrates the diverse opportunities for our drive system 
the delivery of this plug in hybrid bus is part of the continued worldwide sales growth of our drive system technology for commercial and transit buses 
according to results from recent independent third party dynamometer testing  our ic corporation plug in hybrid bus is cleaner than standard diesel buses as they reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as percent  nitrogen oxide by up to percent and particulate matter by as much as percent 
the internal revenue service irs granted several ic corp school and commercial buses equipped with enova s charge depleting hybrid drive system for the qualified heavy hybrid vehicles tax credit 
qualifying heavy hybrid vehicles are new vehicles with a gross vehicle weight in excess of  pounds that meet the definition of a qualifying hybrid vehicle 
a qualifying hybrid vehicle means a motor vehicle which draws propulsion energy from onboard sources of stored energy which are both an internal combustion or heat engine using consumable fuel  and a rechargeable energy storage system 
the and navistar ic bus model pb ce series hybrid school buses as well as the and navistar ic bus model pb ce commercial buses  both equipped with enova s charge depleting hybrid drive systems with gross vehicle weights ranges from   lbs 
and   lbs 
are eligible for  and  tax credits  respectively 
enova management visited first auto works of china s faw research and development center and faw s affiliate electronics manufacturer in china  to further develop the basis for a continued cooperation on hybrid transit buses  and potentially on other faw vehicles 
in addition  enova completed twenty successful trials of our pre transmission hybrid drive systems 
these trials were completed on passenger routes within the olympic sector during the beijing olympics 
as a result of these trials  additional orders have been placed for our pre transmission hybrid electric drive from faw 
the faw hybrid electric city 
table of contents bus is a vehicle that is built by the wuxi division of faw bus coach 
the factory is now set to begin mass production of the new hybrid municipal transit bus which is designed for china s increasingly popular bus rapid transit brt systems and traditional inner city mass transit routes 
this new model  for which faw has proprietary patents  delivers a fuel economy increase of and an emissions reduction of  compared to traditional diesel buses 
optare plc optare engaged enova to develop two different prototype transit buses for a new uk bus manufacturer 
these vehicles were delivered in the third quarter of the plug in hybrid diesel electric and full electric vehicles will use the latest lithium ion battery technology to provide maximum vehicle range and fuel efficiency 
enova s electric and hybrid drive system solutions include fully integrated on board or stationary battery charging systems 
the enova drive systems and chargers will were featured in two  new optare transit buses which debuted in the fourth quarter of at the euro bus expo in birmingham  uk 
in september  the material weakness in our inventory process was remediated and management asserted that internal controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as of september  management asserts that our internal controls over financial reporting were also operating effectively as of december  or the date of this form k annual report as referenced in item a of part ii herein 
enova s product focus is digital power management and power conversion systems 
its software  firmware  and hardware manage and control the power that drives either a vehicle or stationary device s 
they convert the power into the appropriate forms required by the vehicle or device and manage the flow of this energy to optimize efficiency and provide protection for both the system and its users 
our products and systems are the enabling technologies for power systems 
the latest state of the art technologies in hybrid vehicles  fuel cell and micro turbine based systems  and stationary power generation  all require some type of power management and conversion mechanism 
enova systems supplies these essential components 
enova drive systems are fuel neutral  meaning that they have the ability to utilize any type of fuel  including diesel  liquid natural gas or bio diesel fuels 
we also develop  design and produce power management and power conversion components for stationary power generation both on site distributed power and on site telecommunications back up power applications 
additionally  enova performs significant research and development to augment and support others and our internal related product development efforts 
our products are production engineered 
this means they are designed so they can be commercially produced ie  all formats and files are designed with manufacturability in mind  from the start 
for the automotive market  enova designs its products to iso manufacturing and quality standards 
we believe enova s redundancy of systems and rigorous quality standards result in high performance and reduced risk 
for every component and piece of hardware  there are detailed performance specifications 
each piece is tested and evaluated against these specifications  which enhances and confirms the value of the systems to oem customers 
our engineering services focus on system integration support for product sales and custom product design 
in light of our efforts to grow market share in our target markets and penetrate emerging ones  the company acknowledges the principal barrier to commercialization of our drive systems is cost 
the high cost of engineering proprietary software and hardware for our drive systems is high because economies of production in specialized hybrid drive system component parts  batteries  and vehicle integration have not been achieved 
therefore  the cost of our products and engineering services are currently higher than our gasoline and diesel competitor counterparts 
we also believe maturation into commercialization of our drive systems will result in decreases to our long run average costs of materials and services as volume increases over time 
critical accounting policies the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues which require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents cash consists of currency held at reputable financial institutions 
short term  highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable  however  changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
past due balances over days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectibility 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  the company maintains a general reserve for all invoices by applying a percentage based on the age category 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
inventory inventories are priced at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first in  first out fifo cost flow assumption 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
inventory reserve we maintain an allowance against inventory for the potential future obsolescence or excess inventory 
a substantial decrease in expected demand for our products  or decreases in our selling prices could lead to excess or overvalued inventories and could require us to substantially increase our allowance for excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues in the period the revision is made 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to seven years using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
the company uses other depreciation methods generally  accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate 
amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends  and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
long lived assets that management commits to sell or abandon are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
equity method investment investment in itc  a joint venture see note is accounted for by the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  an investee company s accounts are not reflected within the company s balance sheets or statements of operations  however  the company s share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the caption equity losses in non consolidated joint venture in the statements of operations 
the company s carrying value in an equity method joint venture company is reflected in the caption investment in non consolidated joint venture in the company s balance sheets

the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of the beginning in the company s determination of estimated fair value of share based awards utilizes the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding certain highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards as well as actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
revenue recognition the company manufactures proprietary products and other products based on design specifications provided by its customers 
the company recognizes revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee for the arrangement is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement the company documents all terms of an arrangement in a written contract signed by the customer prior to recognizing revenue 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the company performs all services or delivers all products prior to recognizing revenue 
professional consulting and engineering services are considered to be performed when the services are complete 
equipment is considered delivered upon delivery to a customer s designated location 
in certain instances  the customer elects to take title upon shipment 
the fee for the arrangement is fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue  a customer s fee is either fixed or determinable under the terms of the written contract 
fees professional consulting services  engineering services and equipment sales are fixed under the terms of the written contract 
the customer s fee is negotiated at the outset of the arrangement and is not subject to refund or adjustment during the initial term of the arrangement 
collectibility is reasonably assured the company determines that collectibility is reasonably assured prior to recognizing revenue

new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay 
the company does not enter into arrangements unless collectibility is reasonably assured at the outset 
existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors 
if it is determined during the arrangement that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized on a cash basis 
additionally  in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  amounts received upfront for engineering or development fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of committed services or performance  if such arrangements require the company to provide on going services or performance 
all amounts received under collaborative research agreements or research and development contracts are nonrefundable  regardless of the success of the underlying research 
pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board issue eitf issue addressed the accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
specifically  issue requires the recognition of revenue from milestone payments over the remaining minimum period of performance obligations 
as required  the company applies the principles of issue to multiple element agreements 
the company also recognizes engineering and construction contract revenues using the percentage of completion method  based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 

table of contents customer furnished materials  labor  and equipment  and in certain cases subcontractor materials  labor  and equipment  are included in revenues and cost of revenues when management believes that the company is responsible for the ultimate acceptability of the project 
contracts are segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts received are classified as current assets under contract work in progress 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as current liabilities on contracts 
changes in project performance and conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in future revisions to engineering and development contract costs and revenue 
these accounting policies were applied consistently for all periods presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results is included in the footnotes to our financial statements 
several other factors related to the company may have a significant impact on our operating results from year to year 
for example  the accounting rules governing the timing of revenue recognition related to product contracts are complex and it can be difficult to estimate when we will recognize revenue generated by a given transaction 
factors such as acceptance of services provided  payment terms  creditworthiness of the customer  and timing of delivery or acceptance of our products often cause revenues related to sales generated in one period to be deferred and recognized in later periods 
for arrangements in which services revenue is deferred  related direct and incremental costs may also be deferred 
research and development in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research development costs research  development  and engineering costs are expensed in the year incurred 
costs of significantly altering existing technology are expensed as incurred

in the prior year  the share of revenues attributable to tanfield  ic corporation and hcatt were  and  respectively 
the company concentrated on support of several major customers in our migration to a first phase production company through and the first half of the change in the economic environment and the slow down in sales volume from major customers has led management to pursue development contracts with several new customers during the second half of the year  such as optare plc and the darwen group 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or 
the cost of revenues decreased in proportion with sales  with the exception that the company recorded a charge of  resulting from evaluation of slow moving inventory in light of changes in our customer demands 
cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  integration costs and overhead related to manufacturing our products 
product development costs incurred in the performance of engineering development contracts for the us government and private companies are charged to cost of sales 
our customers continue to require additional integration and support services to customize  integrate  and evaluate our products 
we believe that a portion of these costs are initial  one time costs for these customers and anticipate similar costs to be incurred with respect to new customers as we gain additional market share 
customers who have been using our products over one year do not typically incur this same type of initial costs 
gross margin 
the gross margin for the year ended december  was negative compared to a negative in the prior year 
in  we continued efforts to manage product costs through our production process 
however  gross margins declined compared to the prior year due to an increase in the inventory reserve as well as reduced margins experienced in the second half of compared to improvements achieved due to record sales volumes in the second half of the company experienced its largest ever overall shipment volume of units in  which fell to units in research and development expenses

cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to meet our obligations 
therefore  we have had to raise funds through several financing transactions 
at least until we reach breakeven volume in sales and develop and or acquire the capability to manufacture and sell our products profitably  we will need to continue to rely on cash from external financing sources 
our operations during the year ended december  were financed by product sales  working capital reserves and equity capital raises 
at fiscal year end  the company had  of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we have a secured revolving credit facility from union bank of california for  the credit facility expires on june  as of december    was available under the credit facility as a  irrevocable letter of credit was issued by union bank in favor of our landlord with respect to the lease of our new corporate headquarters
