part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation is one of the world s leading producers of titanium melted and mill products 
we are the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium consumption 
we are currently the largest us producer of titanium sponge  a key raw material  and a major recycler of titanium scrap 
titanium metals corporaton was formed in and was incorporated in delaware in unless otherwise indicated  references in this report to we  us or our refer to timet and its subsidiaries  taken as a whole 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications where these qualities satisfy essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium  other end use applications for titanium in military and industrial markets have continued to develop  including the use of titanium based alloys in armor plating  structural components  chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
demand for titanium is also increasing in emerging markets with diverse uses including oil and gas production installations  automotive  geothermal facilities and architectural applications 
our products include titanium sponge  melted products  mill products and industrial fabrications 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers that  like us  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
our long term strategy is to maximize the value of our core aerospace business while expanding our presence in non aerospace markets and developing new applications and products 
over the past three years  we used our operating cash flow and capital resources to fund completion of the expansion of our productive capacity 
the expansion of our existing productive capacity and the availability of our secure third party conversion capabilities allow us to respond to the industry s demand volatility 
as the titanium industry progresses through its demand cycle  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to strategically expand our existing production and conversion capacities through internal expansion and long term third party arrangements  as well as potential joint ventures and acquisitions 
titanium industry 
we develop certain industry estimates based on our extensive experience within the titanium industry as well as information obtained from publicly available external resources eg  united states geological survey  international titanium association and japan titanium society 
we estimate we accounted for approximately of and of worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products and approximately of worldwide titanium sponge production in each of and the following chart illustrates our estimates of aggregate industry mill product shipments over the past ten years industry mill product shipments by sector volumes exclude shipments within china and russia the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace sector has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in titanium mill product shipment volume 
over the past years  the titanium industry has had various cyclical peaks and troughs in mill product shipments 
since  titanium mill product demand in the military  industrial and emerging market sectors has increased  primarily due to the continued development of innovative uses for titanium products in these industries 
over the last several years we  and the industry as a whole  have experienced significantly increased demand with periods of increased volatility 
we estimate that industry shipments approximated  metric tons in and  metric tons in  with each year setting a new industry shipment record 
the estimated growth in was supported by continued strength in the commercial aerospace sector and growth in the industrial sector 
however  we currently expect total industry mill product shipments to decrease by approximately to  driven by anticipated reductions in the commercial aerospace and industrial sectors 
commercial aerospace sector demand for titanium products within the commercial aerospace sector is derived from both jet engine components eg  blades  discs  rings and engine cases and airframe components eg  bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear  wing supports and fasteners 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers 
while industry shipments increased approximately in due in part to strength in the commercial aerospace sector  demand from the commercial aerospace sector is expected to be negatively impacted in by i revisions and push outs of production schedules for the boeing  ii adjustments and delays in certain other commercial aircraft build out schedules and iii boeing s labor dispute  which lasted approximately eight weeks and ended in november these factors are expected to continue to negatively impact demand until uncertainties within the commercial aerospace production cycle are resolved and demand is stabilized on a longer term basis 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  and our business cycle generally correlates to this timeline  although the actual timeline can vary considerably depending on the titanium product 
our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
we shipped approximately of our mill products to the commercial aerospace sector in  whereas we estimate approximately of the overall titanium industry s mill products were shipped to the commercial aerospace sector in the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  traditionally issues worldwide forecasts each january and july for commercial aircraft deliveries  approximately one third of which are expected to be required by the us over the next years 
the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast january estimates deliveries of large commercial aircraft aircraft with over seats totaled including twin aisle aircraft which require more titanium in  and the following table summarizes the forecasted deliveries of large commercial aircraft over the next five years forecasted deliveries increase decrease over previous year year total twin aisle total twin aisle the latest forecast from the airline monitor reflects a decrease in forecasted deliveries over the next five years compared to the july forecast  mainly due to the airline monitor s expectation that airlines will delay or cancel existing orders due to general economic conditions and revisions of production schedules for the boeing boeing and airbus booked orders for  planes in  a decrease from the record bookings in through  and the airline monitor forecasts that aggregate new orders in will be lower than the strong bookings in through have increased the order backlog for both boeing and airbus  which will be delivered over the next several years 
changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of airlines can result in rescheduling or cancellation of orders 
accordingly  aircraft manufacturer backlogs are not necessarily a reliable indicator of near term business activity  but may be indicative of potential business levels over a longer term horizon 
the latest forecast from the airline monitor estimates increases for firm order backlog for both airbus and boeing 
airbus firm order backlog is estimated at  twin aisle planes and  single aisle planes  and boeing s firm order backlog is estimated at  twin aisle planes and  single aisle planes 
boeing does not plan to increase their build rates to make up for aircraft not delivered due to the strike  and boeing has announced that the most recent delay of the will postpone the first customer aircraft delivery until at year end  a total of firm orders had been placed for the airbus a  a program officially launched in with its first delivery in october additionally  at year end  a total of firm orders have been placed for the boeing  a program officially launched in april  with anticipated first deliveries in the will contain more composite materials than other boeing aircraft 
in early years of the manufacturing cycle for the boeing  and any aircraft model  we believe additional titanium will be required to produce each aircraft  and as the program reaches maturity  less titanium will be required for each aircraft manufactured 
during  airbus officially launched the a xwb program  which is a major derivative of the airbus a  with first deliveries scheduled for as of december   a total of firm orders had been placed for the a xwb 
these a xwbs will use composite materials and new engines similar to those used on the boeing and are expected to require significantly more titanium as compared with earlier airbus models 
however  the final titanium buy weight may change as the a xwb is still in the design phase 
twin aisle planes eg  boeing   and and airbus a  a  a and a tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their airframes  engines and parts than single aisle planes eg  boeing and and airbus a  a and a  and new generation models require a significantly higher percentage of titanium 
additionally  boeing generally uses a higher percentage of titanium in its airframes than airbus 
based on information we receive from airframe and engine manufacturers and other industry sources  we estimate approximately metric tons of titanium products are required to manufacture each boeing  approximately metric tons are required to manufacture each boeing  approximately metric tons are required to manufacture each boeing and approximately metric tons will be required to manufacture each boeing  including both the airframes and engines 
additionally  based on these same sources  we estimate approximately metric tons of titanium products are required to manufacture each airbus a  approximately metric tons are required to manufacture each airbus a  approximately metric tons are required to manufacture each airbus a  approximately metric tons will be required to manufacture each airbus a xwb and approximately metric tons are required to manufacture each airbus a  including both the airframes and engines 
military sector titanium shipments into the military sector are largely driven by government defense spending in north america and europe 
military aerospace programs were the first to utilize titanium s unique properties on a large scale  beginning in the s 
titanium shipments to military aerospace markets reached a peak in the s before falling to historical lows in the early s after the end of the cold war 
since  titanium shipments to military aerospace have increased  as discussed below 
based on its physical and performance properties  titanium has become widely accepted for use in applications for ground combat vehicles as well as in naval vessels 
the importance of military markets to the titanium industry is expected to continue to rise in coming years as defense spending budgets increase in reaction to terrorist activities and global conflicts and to replace aging conventional armaments 
defense spending for most systems is expected to remain strong until at least current and anticipated future military strategy leading to light armament and mobility favor the use of titanium due to light weight and improved ballistic performance 
as the strategic military environment demands greater global lift and mobility  the us military needs more airlift capacity and capability 
airframe programs are expected to drive the military market demand for titanium through several of today s active us military programs  including the c and f  are currently expected to continue in production through the middle of the next decade  while other programs  such as the f a and f  are expected to continue into the middle of the next decade 
european military programs also have active aerospace programs offering the possibility for increased titanium consumption 
production levels for the saab gripen  eurofighter typhoon  dassault rafale and dassault mirage are all forecasted to remain steady through the middle or end of the next decade 
in addition to the established programs  newer us programs offer growth opportunities for increased titanium consumption 
the f a raptor was given full rate production approval in april additionally  the f joint strike fighter  now known as the lightning ii  has begun low rate initial production and assembly with delivery of the first production aircraft planned in although no specific delivery schedules have been announced  according to the teal group  a leading aerospace publication  procurement is expected to extend over the next to years and may include production of as many as approximately  planes  including sales to foreign nations 
utilization of titanium on military ground combat vehicles for armor appliqu and integrated armor or structural components continues to gain acceptance within the military market segment 
titanium armor components provide the necessary ballistic performance while achieving a mission critical vehicle performance objective of reduced weight in new generation vehicles 
in order to counteract increased threat levels globally  titanium is being utilized on vehicle upgrade programs in addition to new builds 
based on active programs  as well as programs currently under evaluation  we believe there will be additional usage of titanium on ground combat vehicles that will provide continued growth in the military market sector 
in armor and armament  we sell plate and sheet products for fabrication into appliqu plate and reactive armor for protection of the entire ground combat vehicle as well as the vehicle s primary structure 
industrial and emerging markets sectors the number of end use markets for titanium has continued to expand significantly 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
rapid growth of the chinese and other southeast asian economies has brought unprecedented demand for titanium intensive industrial equipment 
in november  we entered into a joint venture with xi an baotimet valinox tubes co 
ltd 
baotimet to produce welded titanium tubing in the peoples republic of china 
baotimet s production facilities are located in xi an  china  and production began in january titanium continues to gain acceptance in many emerging market applications  including transportation  energy including oil and gas and architecture 
although titanium is often more expensive than other competing metals  over the entire life cycle of the application  we believe titanium is a less expensive alternative due to its durability  longevity and overall environmental impact 
in many cases customers also find the physical properties of titanium to be attractive from the standpoint of weight  performance  design alternatives and other factors 
the oil and gas market  a relatively new  potentially large growth area  utilizes titanium in down hole casing  critical riser components  tapered stress joints  fire water systems and saltwater cooling systems 
additionally  as offshore development of new oil and gas fields moves into the ultra deep water depths and as geothermal energy production expands  market demand for titanium s light weight  high strength and corrosion resistance properties is creating new growth opportunities 
we have focused additional resources on development of alloys and production processes to promote the expansion of titanium use in this market and in other non aerospace applications 
although we estimate emerging market demand presently represents only about of the total industry demand for titanium mill products  we believe emerging market demand  in the aggregate  could grow at double digit rates over the next several years 
we have ongoing initiatives to actively pursue and expand our presence in these markets 
products and operations 
we are a vertically integrated titanium manufacturer whose products include i titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in titanium products  ii melted products ingot  electrodes and slab  the result of melting titanium sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various alloys  iii mill products that are forged and rolled from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe  and iv fabrications spools  pipe fittings  manifolds  vessels  etc 
that are cut  formed  welded and assembled from titanium mill products 
all of our net sales were generated by our integrated titanium operations our titanium melted and mill products segment  which is our only business segment 
business and geographic financial information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
titanium sponge is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal with a porous and sponge like appearance 
the first step in our sponge production involves the combination of titanium containing rutile ores derived from beach sand with chlorine and petroleum coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and magnesium chloride as co products 
our titanium sponge production facility in henderson  nevada uses vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining a vacuum in a chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the sponge mass  and then the sponge mass is mechanically pushed out of the distillation vessel  sheared and crushed to prepare the sponge for incorporation into one of our melted products 
we electrolytically separate and recycle the residual magnesium chloride  a by product of the vdp process  to improve cost efficiency and reduce environmental impact 
melted products ingot  electrodes and slab are produced by melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with alloys  to produce various grades of titanium products suited to the ultimate application of the product 
by introducing other alloys such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium  the melted titanium product is engineered to produce quality grades with varying combinations of certain physical attributes such as strength to weight ratio  corrosion resistance and milling compatibility 
titanium ingot is a cylindrical solid shape that  in our case  weighs up to metric tons 
titanium slab is a rectangular solid shape that  in our case  weighs up to metric tons 
the melting process for ingot and slab is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
in most cases  we use our ingot and slab as the intermediate material for further processing into mill products 
however  we also sell melted products to our customers 
mill products are forged or rolled from our melted products ingot or slab 
mill products include long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe 
our mill products can be further machined to meet customer specifications with respect to size and finish 
we send certain products to outside vendors for further processing eg  certain rolling  forging  finishing and other processing steps in the us  and certain melting and forging steps in france before being shipped to customers 
in france  our primary processor is also a partner in our owned subsidiary  timet savoie  sa during  we entered into a year conversion services agreement with a supplier  whereby they will provide an annual output capacity of  metric tons of titanium mill rolling services until  with our option to increase the output capacity to  metric tons 
additionally  during  we entered into a long term agreement with another supplier whereby they will provide us dedicated annual forging capacity of  metric tons beginning in and increasing to  metric tons for through at least these agreements provide us with long term secure sources for processing round and flat products  resulting in a significant increase in our existing mill product conversion capabilities  which allows us to assure our customers of our long term ability to meet their needs 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  we perform extensive testing on our products 
sonic inspection as well as chemical and mechanical testing procedures are critical to ensuring that our products meet our customers high quality requirements  particularly in aerospace component production 
we certify that our products meet customer specification at the time of shipment for substantially all customer orders 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products and components 
scrap by products from our mill production processes  as well as the scrap purchased from our customers or on the open metals market  is typically recycled and introduced into the melting process once the scrap is sorted and cleaned 
we have the capacity to recycle  to  metric tons of titanium scrap annually at our facility in morgantown  pennsylvania depending on the scrap and end use product mix 
we believe our capability and expertise in recycling titanium scrap provides a competitive advantage 
distribution 
we sell our products through our own sales force based in the us and europe and through independent agents and distributors worldwide 
we also own eight service centers five in the us and three in europe  which we use to sell our products on a just in time basis 
the service centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products  including bar  sheet  plate  tubing and strip 
we believe our service centers provide a competitive advantage because of our ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium ingot  slab and mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloys 
the following table summarizes our raw material usage requirements in the production of our melted and mill products percentage of total raw material requirements internally produced sponge purchased sponge titanium scrap alloys total sponge the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
rutile ore is currently available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa and sri lanka 
we purchase the majority of our supply of rutile ore from australia and south africa 
we believe the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and do not anticipate any interruptions of our rutile supplies 
we currently obtain chlorine from a single supplier near our sponge plant in henderson  nevada 
while we do not anticipate any chlorine supply problems  we have taken steps to mitigate this risk in the event of supply disruption  including establishing the feasibility of certain equipment modifications to enable us to utilize material from alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase and utilize an intermediate product which will allow us to eliminate the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
we are currently the largest us producer of titanium sponge 
in  we completed an expansion of our existing premium grade titanium sponge facility at our henderson plant 
this expansion increased our annual productive sponge capacity to approximately  metric tons  and we supplement our produced sponge with purchases from third parties 
from through  other sponge producers have also undertaken additional capacity expansion projects 
however  we do not know the degree to which quality and cost of the sponge produced by our competitors will be comparable to the premium grade sponge we produce in our henderson facility 
we are party to long term sponge supply agreements that require us to make minimum annual purchases 
these long term supply agreements  together with our current sponge production capacity in henderson  should provide us with a total annual available sponge supply at levels ranging from  metric tons up to  metric tons through  which we expect to meet our sponge supply requirements 
titanium melted and mill products require varying grades of sponge and or scrap depending on the customers specifications and expected end use 
we will continue to purchase sponge from a variety of sources in  including those sources under existing supply agreements 
due to anticipated reductions in demand in for titanium products  we continue to evaluate alternatives to balance our internal and external sources for titanium sponge 
scrap we recycle titanium scrap into melted products that will be sold to our customers or used as intermediate feedstock for our mill production process 
our titanium scrap is generated from our melted and mill product production processes  purchased from certain of our customers under contractual agreements or acquired in the open metals market 
such scrap consists of alloyed and commercially pure solids and turnings 
scrap obtained through customer arrangements provides a closed loop arrangement resulting in certainty of supply and cost stability 
externally purchased scrap comes from a wide range of sources  including customers  collectors  processors and brokers 
due to our successful efforts to increase the volume of scrap obtained through closed loop arrangements  we only purchased of our scrap requirement from the open metals market in  and we expect our scrap purchases to remain at the same rate during we expect our scrap consumption to remain at high levels as we continue to emphasize the utilization of scrap for our electron beam cold hearth eb melting activity 
we also occasionally sell scrap  usually in a form or grade we cannot economically recycle for use in our production operations 
overall market forces can significantly impact the supply or cost of externally produced scrap  as the amount of scrap generated in the supply chain varies during titanium business cycles 
early in the titanium cycle  the demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to increase the scrap requirements for titanium manufacturers 
this demand precedes the increase in scrap generation by downstream customers and the supply chain 
the pressure on scrap generation and the supply chain at this stage of the cycle places upward pressure on the market price of scrap 
the opposite situation occurs when demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to decline  resulting in greater availability of scrap supply and downward pressure on the market price of scrap 
during the middle of the cycle  scrap generation and consumption are in relative equilibrium  minimizing disruptions in supply or significant changes in the available supply and market prices for scrap 
increasing or decreasing cycles tend to cause significant changes in both the supply and market price of scrap 
these supply chain dynamics result in selling prices for melted and mill products which generally tend to correspond with the changes in raw material costs 
all of our major competitors utilize scrap as a raw material in their titanium melt operations  and steel manufacturers also use titanium scrap as an alloy to produce interstitial free steels  stainless steels and high strength low alloy steels 
prices for all forms and grades of titanium scrap declined steadily during the first half of due to increased availability and reduced demand 
the global recession reduced demand for titanium scrap in the second half of  which resulted in sharp declines in scrap prices late in as a result of the market forces described above  general economic conditions are expected to continue to affect the prices of titanium scrap in other various alloy additions used in the production of titanium products  such as vanadium and molybdenum  are also available from a number of suppliers 
the decline in demand from steel manufacturers for vanadium and molybdenum also resulted in dramatic drops in cost for these alloys  and we expect alloy costs will continue to fluctuate in the future 
customer agreements 
we have long term agreements ltas with certain major customers  including  among others  the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc and its german and us affiliates rolls royce  united technologies corporation utc  pratt whitney and related companies  the safran companies safran  snecma and related companies  wyman gordon company wyman gordon  a unit of precision castparts corporation pcc and valtimet sas 
these agreements expire at various times through  are subject to certain conditions and generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements or firm annual volume commitments  ii formula determined prices including some elements based on market pricing and iii price adjustments for certain raw material  labor and energy cost fluctuations 
generally  the ltas require our service and product performance to meet specified criteria and contain a number of other terms and conditions customary in transactions of these types 
certain provisions of these ltas have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
our sales revenues to customers under ltas were of our total sales revenues 
in certain events of nonperformance by us or the customer  an lta may be terminated early 
although it is possible that some portion of the business would continue on a non lta basis  the termination or expiration of one or more of the ltas could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the ltas were designed to limit selling price volatility to the customer and to us  while providing us with a committed volume base throughout the titanium industry business cycles and certain mechanisms to adjust pricing for changes in certain cost elements 
markets and customer base 
as discussed previously  we produce a wide range of melted and mill titanium products for our customers  and selling prices generally reflect raw material and other productions costs as well as reasonable profit margins 
selling prices are generally influenced by industry and global economic conditions 
for instance  since early  increases in global capacity and manufacturing activity for titanium products throughout the supply chain have increased the availability of titanium scrap  which has resulted in declining costs for this raw material 
this decline in raw material costs has  in turn  contributed to lower selling prices for certain products under ltas  due in part to raw material indexed pricing adjustments included in certain of these agreements  as well as for our non contract sales volume 
the demand for our titanium products is global  and our global productive capabilities allow us to respond to our customers needs 
the following table summarizes our sales revenue by geographical location year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue sales revenue to customers within north america europe other total further information regarding our external sales  net income  long lived assets and total assets can be found in our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income and notes and to the consolidated financial statements

we sell directly to these major manufacturers  as well as to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use our titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft and or jet engine build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on our business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
the market for titanium in the military sector includes sales of melted and mill titanium products engineered for applications for military aircraft both engines and airframes  armor and component parts  armor appliqu on ground combat vehicles and other integrated armor or structural components 
we sell directly to many of the major manufacturers associated with military programs on a global basis 
outside of commercial aerospace and military sectors  we manufacture a wide range of products for customers in the chemical process  oil and gas  consumer  sporting goods  healthcare  automotive and power generation sectors 
in addition to melted and mill products  which are sold into all market sectors  we sell certain other products such as titanium fabrications  titanium scrap and titanium tetrachloride 
our backlog was approximately billion at december  and billion at december  over of our year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during our order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
we have explored and will continue to explore strategic arrangements in the areas of product development  production and distribution 
we will also continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique properties and qualities 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of melted and mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  france  germany  italy  russia  china and the united kingdom 
additionally  producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be used or modified to process titanium products 
there are also several producers of titanium sponge in the world  at least four of which are currently in some stage of increasing sponge production capacity 
we believe entry as a new producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment  substantial technical expertise and significant lead time 
our principal competitors in the aerospace titanium market are allegheny technologies incorporated ati and rti international metals  inc rti  both based in the united states  and verkhnaya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo  based in russia 
uniti a joint venture between ati and vsmpo  rti and certain japanese producers are our principal competitors in the industrial and emerging markets 
we compete primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of foreign participants has become a significant competitive factor 
prior to  imports of foreign titanium products into the us were not significant  primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
to the extent we are able to take advantage of this situation by purchasing sponge from such countries for use in our own operations  the negative effect of these imports on us can be somewhat mitigated 
trade and tariffs generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
because a significant portion of end use products made from titanium products are ultimately exported  we  along with our principal competitors and many customers  actively utilize the duty drawback mechanism to recover most of the tariff paid on imports 
from time to time  the us government has granted preferential trade status to certain titanium products imported from particular countries notably wrought titanium products from russia  which carried no us import duties from approximately until 
it is possible that such preferential status could be granted again in the future 
the japanese government has raised the elimination or harmonization of tariffs on titanium products  including titanium sponge  for consideration in multi lateral trade negotiations through the world trade organization the so called doha round 
as part of the doha round  the united states has proposed the staged elimination of all industrial tariffs  including those on titanium 
the japanese government has specifically asked that titanium in all its forms be included in the tariff elimination program 
we have urged that no change be made to these tariffs  either on wrought or unwrought products 
the negotiations are ongoing and are expected to continue during we will continue to resist efforts to eliminate duties on titanium products  although we may not be successful in these activities 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  slab and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge  ingot  slab and mill products and thus our results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
section b of title  united states code  legislation formerly known as the berry amendment  requires that subject to certain exceptions the united states department of defense dod expend funds for products containing specialty metals  including titanium  only if the specialty metals have been melted or produced in the united states 
in  the dod proposed regulations regarding the implementation of this specialty metals law that may reduce its effectiveness 
we have filed comments urging the dod not to adopt the proposed regulations and will continue to resist attempts to undermine this specialty metals law 
a weakening in the enforcement of this specialty metals law could increase foreign competition for sales of titanium for defense products  adversely affecting our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
research and development 
our research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
key research activities include the development of new alloys  development of technology required to enhance the performance of our products in the traditional industrial and aerospace markets and applications development for emerging markets 
in addition  we continue to work in partnership with the united states defense advanced research projects agency darpa and others to explore means to reduce the cost of titanium production 
the work with darpa complements our research  development and exploration of innovative technologies and improvements to the existing processes such as vacuum distillation of sponge and vacuum arc remelting processes 
we conduct the majority of our research and development activities at our henderson technical laboratory  with additional activities at our witton  england facility 
we incurred research and development costs of million in  million in and million in patents and trademarks 
we hold us and us patents applicable to certain of our titanium alloys and manufacturing technology  which expire at various times from through and we have certain other patent applications pending 
we continually seek patent protection with respect to our technology base and have occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
we believe the trademarks timet and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are important to our business 
however  the majority of our titanium alloys and manufacturing technologies do not benefit from patent or other intellectual property protection 
employees 
our employee headcount varies due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and its impact on our business 
our employee headcount includes both our full and part time employees 
the following table shows our approximate employee headcount at the end of the past years employees at december  us europe total our production and maintenance workers in henderson and our production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio approximately half of our total us employees are represented by the united steelworkers of america under contracts expiring in january and june  respectively 
employees at our other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a majority of the salaried and hourly employees at our european facilities are represented by various european labor unions 
our labor agreement with our uk production and maintenance employees expired at the end of  and a new labor agreement is currently under negotiation 
our labor agreement with our uk managerial and professional employees runs through march our labor agreements with our french and italian employees are renewed annually 
we currently consider our employee relations to be good 
however  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
regulatory and environmental matters 
our operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the occupational  safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the toxic substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
we use and manufacture substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous  extremely hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
we have used and manufactured such substances throughout the history of our operations 
although we have substantial controls and procedures designed to reduce continuing risk of environmental  health and safety issues  we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws  common law theories of liability or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
in addition  government environmental requirements or the enforcement thereof may become more stringent in the future 
it is possible that some  or all  of these risks could result in liabilities that would be material to our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
our policy is to maintain compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker health and safety laws and strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
we incurred capital expenditures related to health  safety and environmental compliance and improvement of approximately million in  million in and million in from time to time  we may be subject to health  safety or environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties or the expenditure of additional funds on compliance 
furthermore  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental  health or safety laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
as part of our continuing environmental assessment with respect to our plant site in henderson in the third quarter of we completed and submitted to the nevada department of environmental protection ndep a remedial alternative study ras with respect to the groundwater located beneath the plant site 
the ras  which was submitted pursuant to an existing agreement between the ndep and us  addressed the presence of certain contaminants in the plant site groundwater that require remediation 
the ras proposes various alternatives to the ndep for the remediation of these contaminants 
upon our completion and submission of the ras to ndep  we increased our estimated cost to complete the groundwater remediation by million during the ndep completed its review of the ras and our proposed remedial alternatives during the fourth quarter of  and the ndep issued its record of decision concerning the remediation plan in february see note to the consolidated financial statements

item a risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with our business 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor that could result in reduced earnings  liquidity or operating losses  could in turn adversely affect our ability to meet our liabilities or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace industry  which represents a significant portion of our business  creates uncertainty regarding our future profitability 
in addition  adverse changes to  or interruptions in  our relationships with our major commercial aerospace customers could reduce our revenues and impact our profitability 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers 
the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace sector has been the principal driver of the fluctuations in the performance of most titanium product producers 
our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
we shipped approximately of our mill products to commercial aerospace customers in  whereas we estimate approximately of the overall titanium industry s mill products were shipped to commercial aerospace customers in our melted and mill product sales to commercial aerospace customers accounted for of our total sales in  in and in in addition to general economic conditions  the commercial aerospace sector is expected to be negatively impacted in by i revisions and push outs of production schedules for the boeing  ii adjustments and delays in certain other commercial aircraft build out schedules and iii boeing s labor dispute  which lasted approximately eight weeks and ended in november these factors are expected to continue to negatively impact commercial aerospace demand until uncertainties within the commercial aerospace production cycle are resolved and demand is stabilized on a longer term basis 
we estimate that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will decrease to from levels 
events that could adversely affect the commercial aerospace sector  such as future terrorist attacks  world health crises  the general economic downturn or unforeseen reductions in orders from commercial airlines  could significantly decrease our results of operations and financial condition 
see business titanium industry commercial aerospace sector 
sales under ltas with customers in the commercial aerospace sector accounted for approximately of our total sales 
these ltas expire at various times beginning in through if we are unable to maintain our relationships with our major commercial aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce  safran  utc and wyman gordon  under the ltas we have with these customers  our sales could decrease substantially  negatively impacting our profitability 
see business customer agreements and business markets and customer base 
global economic conditions may affect pricing and demand for our products which could lead to reduced revenues and profitability 
pricing and demand for our products are affected by a number of factors  including changes in demand for our customer s products  changes in general economic conditions  availability of credit  changes in market demand  lower overall pricing due to overcapacity  lower priced imports and increases in the use of substitute materials 
the current global economic downturn could lead to further reductions in demand for our products and our customers products  excess inventory within the titanium supply chain and excess capacity throughout the industry  including our manufacturing locations 
furthermore  reductions in credit generally available in the financial markets could have adverse impacts on the industry including our business 
in addition to the impact that global economic conditions have already had on our business  if these conditions worsen or persist  our financial condition and results of operations may be further impacted 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
the global titanium markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  such as price  product quality and service 
some of our competitors may be able to drive down market prices because their costs are lower than our costs 
in addition  some of our competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the industries in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
in addition  producers of metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities 
such facilities could be used or modified to process titanium mill products  which could lead to increased competition and decreased pricing for our titanium products 
in addition  many factors  including excess capacity resulting from reduced demand in the titanium industry  work to intensify the price competition for available business at low points in the business cycle 
our dependence upon certain critical raw materials that are subject to price and availability fluctuations could lead to increased costs or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers around the world  and principally on those located in australia and south africa  for our supply of titanium containing rutile ore  one of the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge 
while chlorine  another of the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge  is generally widely available  we currently obtain our chlorine from a single supplier near our sponge plant in henderson 
also  we cannot supply all our needs for all grades of titanium sponge and scrap internally and are therefore dependent on third parties for a substantial portion of our raw material requirements 
all of our major competitors utilize sponge and scrap as raw materials in their melt operations 
titanium scrap is also used in certain steel making operations  and demand for these steel products  especially from china  also influences demand for titanium scrap 
purchase prices and availability of these critical materials are subject to volatility 
at any given time  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical materials on a timely basis  on price and other terms acceptable to us  or at all 
to help stabilize our supply of titanium sponge  we have entered into ltas with certain sponge suppliers that contain fixed annual supply obligations 
these ltas contain minimum annual purchase requirements and  in certain cases  include take or pay provisions which require us to pay penalties if we do not meet the minimum annual purchase requirements 
see business products and operations raw materials  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual commitments and note to the consolidated financial statements 
although overall inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate  during the same period certain critical raw material costs in our industry  including titanium sponge and scrap  have been volatile 
while we are able to mitigate some of the adverse impact of fluctuating raw material costs through ltas with suppliers and customers  rapid increases in raw material costs may adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to implement price increases 
we change prices on certain of our products from time to time 
our ability to implement price increases is dependent on market conditions  economic factors  raw material costs and availability  competitive factors  operating costs and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
the benefits of any price increases may be delayed due to long manufacturing lead times and the terms of existing contracts 
pricing under our ltas  which were designed to limit selling price volatility to our customers and us  are generally revised on an annual basis 
these factors have had  and may have  an adverse impact on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
our failure to develop new markets would result in our continued dependence on the cyclical commercial aerospace sector  and our operating results would  accordingly  remain cyclical 
in an effort to reduce dependence on the commercial aerospace market and to increase participation in other markets  we have devoted certain resources to developing new markets and applications for our products 
developing these emerging market applications involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to the fact that titanium must compete with less expensive alternative materials in these potential markets or applications 
we may not be successful in developing new markets or applications for our products  significant time may be required for such development and uncertainty exists as to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
because we are subject to environmental and worker safety laws and regulations  we may be required to remediate the environmental effects of our operations or take steps to modify our operations to comply with these laws and regulations  which could reduce our profitability 
various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations govern our operations 
throughout the history of our operations  we have used and manufactured  and currently use and manufacture  substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous  extremely hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
although we have substantial controls and procedures designed to reduce continuing risk of environmental  health and safety issues  we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
in addition  government environmental requirements or the enforcement thereof may become more stringent in the future 
some or all of these risks may result in liabilities that could reduce our profitability 
reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all tariffs on imported titanium products into the united states could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  slab and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could decrease pricing for our products 
in the us titanium market  the increasing presence of foreign participants has become a significant competitive factor 
until  imports of foreign titanium products into the us had not been significant 
this was primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
from time to time  the us government has granted preferential trade status to certain titanium products imported from particular countries notably wrought titanium products from russia  which carried no us import duties from approximately until 
it is possible that such preferential status could be granted again in the future  and we may not be successful in resisting efforts to eliminate duties or tariffs on titanium products

these capacities are as of december  and do not reflect the increases expected to be realized during as a result of capacity expansion projects  several of which are mentioned below 
practical capacities are based on the approximate maximum equivalent product that cezus is contractually obligated to provide 
during the past three years  our major production facilities have operated at varying levels of practical capacity 
overall our plants operated at approximately of practical capacity in each of and and in while practical capacity and utilization measures can vary significantly based upon the mix of products produced  we anticipate operating our plants at lower production levels in due to reduced demand 
united states production 
in  we completed the expansion of our existing premium grade titanium sponge facility in henderson and reached practical capacity for commercial production in early this expansion increased our annual productive capacity to approximately  metric tons 
our us melting facilities in henderson  morgantown and vallejo produce ingot and slab  which are either used as feedstock for our mill products operations or sold to third parties  and we are in the process of expanding our melt capacity 
our melting facilities operated at approximately of annual practical capacity in we expect lower capacity utilization in  as melt capacities increase during in early  we completed an  metric ton expansion of our eb melt capacity in morgantown 
in addition  we have commenced construction of another eb furnace at the same facility  which is currently on schedule to be completed in the first half of which  upon completion  will increase our eb melt capacity by approximately 
also during  we completed an addition to our var capacity in morgantown  which increased our var capacity by approximately  metric tons 
our raw materials processing facility in morgantown primarily processes scrap used as melting feedstock  either in combination with sponge or separately 
we produce titanium mill products in the us at our forging and rolling facility in toronto  which receives ingot and slab principally from our us melting facilities 
our us forging and rolling facility operated at approximately of annual practical capacity in  and we expect lower utilization in capacity utilization across our individual mill product lines varies 
under various conversion services agreements with third party vendors  we have access to a dedicated annual capacity at certain of our vendors facilities 
our access to outside conversion services includes dedicated annual rolling capacity of at least  metric tons until  with the option to increase the output capacity to  metric tons 
additionally  we have access to dedicated annual forging capacity of  metric tons beginning in and ramping up to  metric tons for through at least these agreements provide us with long term secure sources for processing round and flat products  resulting in a significant increase in our existing mill product conversion capabilities  which allows us to assure our customers of our long term ability to meet their needs

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary general overview 
we are a vertically integrated producer of titanium sponge  melted products and a variety of mill products for commercial aerospace  military  industrial and other applications 
we are one of the world s leading producers of titanium melted products ingot  electrodes and slab and mill products billet  bar  plate  sheet and strip 
we are the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
we are currently the largest producer of titanium sponge  a key raw material  in the united states 
we sell our titanium melted and mill products into four worldwide market sectors 
aggregate shipment volumes for titanium mill products in were derived from the following sectors timet titanium industry mill product shipments of total mill product shipments of total metric tons metric tons commercial aerospace military industrial emerging markets estimates based on our titanium industry experience and information obtained from publicly available external resources eg  united states geological survey  international titanium association and japan titanium society 
the titanium industry derives a substantial portion of its demand from the highly cyclical commercial aerospace sector 
as shown in the table above  our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments  and select from a range of possible estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory allowances  asset lives  impairments of investments  the recoverability of other long lived assets  including property and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related underlying actuarial assumptions  the realization of deferred income tax assets  and accruals for asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments  to varying degrees  on historical experience  advice of external specialists and various other factors we believe to be prudent under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts and such estimates  assumptions and judgments are regularly subject to revision 
we consider the policies and estimates discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires our most significant judgments in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
inventory valuation 
we provide reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for our products  alternate uses of the inventory and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  we may be required to recognize additional inventory reserves 
impairment of long lived assets 
generally  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets may not be recoverable  we undertake an evaluation of the assets or asset group 
if this evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is not recoverable  the amount of the impairment would typically be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows or appraised values 
all relevant factors are considered in determining whether an impairment exists 
we did not evaluate any long lived assets for impairment during because no such impairment indicators were present 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance if realization of our gross deferred income tax assets is not more likely than not after giving consideration to recent historical results and near term projections  and we also consider the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact the need for  or amount of  any valuation allowance 
we record reserves for uncertain tax positions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions  for tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
see results of operations income taxes for discussion of our analysis of our deferred income tax valuation allowances and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
pension and opeb expenses and obligations 
our pension and opeb expenses and obligations are calculated based on several estimates  including discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
we review these rates annually with the assistance of our actuaries 
see further discussion of the factors considered and potential effect of these estimates in liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
results of operations comparison of to summarized financial information 
the following table summarizes certain information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and our reported average selling prices reflect actual selling prices after the effects of currency exchange rates  customer and product mix and other related factors throughout the periods presented 
for the year ended december  of total net sales of total net sales in millions  except product shipment data net sales melted products mill products other titanium products total net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  administrative and development expense other expense  net operating income melted product shipments volume metric tons average selling price per kilogram mill product shipments volume metric tons average selling price per kilogram net sales 
our net sales were  million during compared to net sales of  million during average selling prices for melted and mill products decreased and  respectively  from to revisions and delays in the build out schedules of certain commercial aircraft  and the resulting effects on production and inventory levels throughout the supply chain  continue to negatively impact near term demand and selling prices for titanium products 
recent declines in raw material costs  primarily titanium scrap  have also contributed to lower selling prices for certain products under long term agreements  due in part to raw material indexed pricing adjustments included in certain of these agreements 
although we believe long term demand trends are favorable  the adjustments and delays in the production schedule for the boeing  including production delays resulting from boeing s labor dispute which was resolved during the fourth quarter of  and the recent decline in global economic conditions  are expected to continue to impact customer inventory levels and product demand in cost of sales 
our cost of sales was million during compared to cost of sales of million in  a increase from  primarily resulting from a shift in our product mix to a higher concentration of mill products for mill products carry a higher unit cost than melted products due to labor  overhead and yield costs associated with additional processing 
cost of sales for was favorably impacted by declining costs for titanium scrap  but these favorable impacts were substantially offset by higher costs of production  primarily energy  and certain other raw materials 
we anticipate that our per unit cost of sales for both melted and mill products will continue to be favorably impacted by declining titanium scrap costs  but these favorable effects could be offset if production volumes decrease  which could result in additional per unit overhead allocations  or if costs of production and other raw materials rise 
gross margin 
during  our gross margin was million as compared to million for  primarily reflecting decreases in the average selling prices for our melted and mill products 
operating income 
our operating income for was million compared to million during primarily due to the decline in gross margin 
the period includes a million expense related to previously capitalized costs associated with the planning and engineering for a new vdp sponge plant  based on our decision to delay the project indefinitely 
net other non operating income and expense 
during  we recognized other non operating income of million consisting primarily of million in foreign currency gains as the dollar strengthened against the pound sterling and the euro in the second half of and a million gain on sale of an investment discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we recognized other non operating income of million consisting primarily of an million gain on the sale of our investment in compx discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  and as a result  the geographic mix of our pre tax income or loss can impact our overall effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate for was lower than the us statutory rate  primarily due to a change in the mix of our pre tax earnings  with a higher percentage of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions in  primarily as a result of the implementation of an internal corporate reorganization in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax expense to our actual tax expense 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to an internal reorganization we implemented in the second quarter of  an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforward following the sale of an investment  an income tax benefit of million from the special manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of  and an income tax expense of million related to an increase in our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to an internal reorganization we implemented in the second quarter of  an income tax benefit of million related primarily to the reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforward following the sale of our interest in compx  and an income tax benefit of million from the special manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of the uk has proposed legislation that  if enacted  would increase our effective income tax rate and our cash tax payments 
comparison of to summarized financial information 
the following table summarizes certain information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and our reported average selling prices reflect actual selling prices after the effects of currency exchange rates  customer and product mix and other related factors throughout the periods presented 
for the year ended december  of total net sales of total net sales in millions  except product shipment data net sales melted products mill products other titanium products total net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general  administrative and development expense other income expense  net operating income melted product shipments volume metric tons average selling price per kilogram mill product shipments volume metric tons average selling price per kilogram net sales 
during  net sales increased to  million from  million in average selling prices for melted and mill products increased and  respectively  in compared to customer demands influenced a shift of our product mix toward an increased proportion of mill products  which require additional processing and resources and also command higher sales prices as compared to melted products 
while our combined melted and mill product shipment volume declined during  our mill product shipment volume increased slightly in compared to the prior year 
the increased pricing on our products and the favorable shift in product mix more than offset the effect of lower aggregate sales volume for compared to cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased million  or  in as compared to due to an increase in certain raw material costs  including titanium sponge and scrap  and higher production costs associated with our shift in product mix to a greater percentage of mill products 
the higher cost of sponge in is partially due to our final utilization in the first half of of lower cost sponge previously purchased from the us defense logistics agency stockpile and the rapid rise in titanium sponge and scrap market prices experienced through early in  increases in global titanium sponge capacity and increased use of titanium in the manufacture of components and products resulted in the increased availability of titanium sponge and scrap 
as a result  our cost of purchased titanium sponge and scrap declined during the latter part of these declining raw material costs  in certain cases  resulted in indexed adjustments to selling prices under our long term sales agreements 
the majority of the products sold during included higher cost raw materials acquired during prior periods due to the elapsed time required to convert these raw materials into their final form and to deliver them to our customers 
gross margin 
during  our gross margin increased to million as compared to reflecting the net effect of increases in average selling prices  and partially offsetting cost of sales increases associated with our higher raw material costs and higher cost of production  as discussed above 
operating income 
our operating income for was million compared to million for the period includes a million expense related to previously capitalized costs associated with the planning and engineering for a new vdp sponge plant based on our decision to delay the project indefinitely 
the period was positively impacted by million of equity in earnings related to our interest in the valtimet joint venture that we sold in december  partially offset by million of travel  relocation and severance expenses incurred in connection with the relocation of our headquarters to dallas  texas and our operational management and information technology group to exton  pennsylvania 
net other non operating income and expense 
during  we recognized other non operating income of million compared to other non operating income of million during as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we realized an million gain on the sale of our investment in compx during  and we realized a million gain on the sale of our investment in valtimet during income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  and as a result  the geographic mix of our pre tax income or loss can impact our overall effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate for was lower than the us statutory rate  primarily due to a change in the mix of our pre tax earnings  with a higher percentage of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions in  primarily as a result of the implementation of an internal corporate reorganization in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax expense to our actual tax expense 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to an internal reorganization we implemented in the second quarter of  an income tax benefit of million related primarily to the reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforward following the sale of our interest in compx  and an income tax benefit of million from the special manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of a portion of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforward following the sale of our interest in valtimet  an income tax benefit of million from the special manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of  and an income tax benefit of million related to the elimination of certain items included in other comprehensive income following the sale of our interest in valtimet 
european operations we have substantial operations located in the united kingdom  france and italy 
approximately of our sales originated in europe for  a portion of which were denominated in foreign currency  principally the british pound sterling or the euro 
certain raw material costs  principally purchases of titanium sponge and alloys for our european operations  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries  and the european subsidiaries are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that may impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
borrowings of our european operations may be in us dollars or in functional currencies 
our export sales from the us are denominated in us dollars and are not subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not use currency contracts to hedge our currency exposures 
at december   consolidated assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currencies were approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of us dollar cash  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
outlook we sold a record  metric tons of titanium mill products during  despite softening demand in the fourth quarter of the year 
in addition to the global credit crisis and economic recession  circumstances within the commercial aerospace market  including i the eight week labor dispute at boeing  ii continued production delays on the boeing and iii the resulting excess titanium inventory in the supply chain  have contributed to weakened customer demand and lower prices for titanium products 
we expect customer demand to remain volatile until uncertainties in the global economy and within the commercial aerospace production schedules begin to be resolved and inventory levels begin to stabilize 
although we have long term agreements with a majority of our major customers  many of which specify annual pricing mechanisms and minimum volume commitments that limit our exposure to the volatility of market pricing and fluctuating demand  we still anticipate reductions in our overall sales volumes and average selling prices for we anticipate that our per unit cost of sales for both melted and mill products will continue to be favorably impacted by declining titanium scrap costs  but these favorable effects could be offset if production volumes decrease  which could result in additional per unit overhead allocations  or if costs of production and other raw materials rise 
despite the demand volatility the industry is currently experiencing and the uncertainty surrounding the extent and duration of the current economic downturn  we believe the overall industry outlook supports a long term favorable trend in demand for titanium products 
we continue to pursue our strategic plans to increase and improve our production capabilities  with a focus on opportunities to improve our operating flexibility  efficiency and cost structure  to meet the long term demands reflected in the titanium product volumes our customers have committed to purchase under long term agreements and in long term market sector forecasts 
in particular  we continue to enhance our ability to meet our current and prospective customers needs and strengthen our position as a reliable supplier in markets where technical ability and precision are critical 
we have been successful over the last two years in establishing significant flexibility and cost advantages in our entire manufacturing process 
we believe that our strong customer relationships  efficient manufacturing processes and strong balance sheet have kept us well positioned in the current economic environment 
we are in a strong financial position  with no debt and significant positive cash flow 
we believe our financial strength will allow us to continue to invest in our business  fully serve our current and prospective customer requirements and pursue strategic opportunities 
liquidity and capital resources our consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities operating activities 
cash flow from operations is considered a primary source of our liquidity 
changes in pricing  production volume and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
cash provided by operating activities increased million  from million in to in the net effects of the following significant items contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities lower operating income in of million  lower net cash used in operations resulting from changes in receivables  inventories  payables and accrued liabilities of million in in response to changing working capital requirements and improved collections of receivables  and lower net cash paid for income taxes in of million due primarily to lower taxable income in cash provided by operating activities increased million  from million in to million in the net effects of the following significant items contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities lower operating income in of million  the million payment made to haynes in in return for the dedicated rolling capacity  lower net cash used in operations resulting from changes in receivables  inventories  payables and accrued liabilities of million in in response to changing working capital requirements  and higher net cash paid for income taxes in of million due to the utilization of the remainder of our us net operating loss carryforward in investing activities 
cash flows used in our investing activities changed from million in to million in to million in our capital expenditures were million during both and compared to million in capital projects and other significant investing activities include the following during  we incurred a higher level of expenditures related to the eb melt capacity expansion project at our facility in morgantown and other capacity expansion projects at several of our us and european plants 
during  we had lower capital expenditures on the sponge capacity expansion project compared to  as the expansion was completed in april however  during we incurred a higher level of expenditures than we incurred during related to the eb melt capacity expansion project at our facility in morgantown and other capacity expansion projects initiated in which largely offset the expenditure reductions on the sponge plant expansion project 
the capital expenditure amount includes expenditures related to our sponge plant expansion in henderson  which became fully operational in  and our eb furnace at our facility in morgantown  which became operational in early we purchased million in marketable equity securities during we received principal payments on notes receivable from affiliates of million in and million in we received proceeds of million from the sale of our interest in valtimet during financing activities 
we had net repayments under our us bank credit facility of million in  funded primarily with a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in valtimet 
we had no net borrowing activity during and other significant items included in our cash flows from financing activities included dividends paid on our common stock of million in and million in  as we began paying a quarterly dividend of per share in the fourth quarter of  dividends paid on our series a preferred stock of million in  million in and million in  dividends paid to cezus of million in  million in and million in  treasury stock purchases of million during  proceeds from the issuance of our common stock upon exercise of stock options of million in  million in and a nominal amount in  and an income tax benefit of million in  million in and a nominal amount in related to the exercise of stock options 
future cash requirements liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is our cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under various credit facilities 
we generally use these amounts to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness  iii make investments in marketable and other securities including the acquisition of securities issued by our subsidiaries and affiliates or iv fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our alternative uses of capital  debt service requirements  the cost of debt and equity capital and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past  or in light of our current outlook  may in the future  seek to raise additional capital  modify our common and preferred dividend policies  restructure ownership interests  incur  refinance or restructure indebtedness  repurchase shares of common stock  purchase or redeem series a preferred stock  sell assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the titanium  specialty metal and other industries 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunities  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing equity securities or incurring additional indebtedness 
we paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share in and four such quarterly cash dividends in in february  our board of directors decided to suspend our quarterly dividend after considering the current economic and financial environment 
we believe it is in our best interest to enhance our financial strength which will allow us to continue investing in our business and taking advantage of potential opportunities in our industry  including acquisitions  long term partnering agreements or joint ventures  if and when such strategic opportunities arise 
additionally  we will have the flexibility to repurchase shares of our common stock under our previously announced repurchase programs without sacrificing our ability to pursue other opportunities in our industry 
the declaration and payment of future dividends will be dependent upon the board s consideration of our cash requirements  contractual requirements  strategic plans and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
at december   we had aggregate borrowing availability under our existing u 
s and european credit facilities of million  and we had an aggregate of million of cash and cash equivalents 
our us credit facility matures in february  and our us credit facility matures in july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon our expectations of our operating performance  the anticipated demands on our cash resources  borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities and anticipated borrowing capacity after the maturity of these credit facilities  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the short term defined as the next twelve month period and our long term obligations  including our planned capacity expansion projects  some of which are discussed below 
repurchases of common stock 
at february   we had approximately million available for repurchase of our common stock under the authorizations described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures 
we currently estimate we will invest a total of approximately million to million for capital expenditures during in response to current economic conditions  our planned capital expenditures are limited to those required to properly maintain our equipment and facilities or complete active projects  such as the ongoing construction of a melt furnace at our morgantown facility 
capital spending for is expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities or existing cash resources and available credit facilities 
we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to improve or replace productive assets including capital projects  acquisitions or other investments which  if consummated  any required funding would be provided by borrowings under our us or european credit facilities 
contractual commitments 
as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we were a party to various agreements at december  that contractually commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including pricing  quantity and date of payment payment due date after total in millions operating leases purchase obligations raw materials other other contractual obligations these obligations generally relate to the purchase of titanium sponge pursuant to ltas that expire at varying dates as described in item business and various other open orders or commitments for purchase of raw materials 
certain of the ltas contain automatic renewal provisions  however  we have only included the purchase commitments associated with the initial terms of each lta 
these obligations generally relate to contractual purchase obligations for conversion services  certain operating fees paid to cezus for use of a portion of its ugine plant pursuant to an agreement expiring in as described in item properties  energy purchase obligations with bmi which expire in and various other open orders for purchase of energy  utilities and property and equipment 
these obligations are generally based on an average price and an assumed constant mix of services purchased  as appropriate 
all open orders are primarily for delivery in these other obligations include an obligation under a worker s compensation bond and capital and interest payments under capital lease agreements  both of which are recorded on our balance sheet as of december  additionally  we have an obligation to contran under an intercorporate services agreement isa which will be recorded ratably over the service period 
we expect renew the isa annually 
the above table does not reflect any amounts that we might pay to fund our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans  as the timing and amount of any such future fundings are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the future performance of defined benefit pension plan assets  interest rate assumptions and actual future retiree medical costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing agreements other than the outstanding letters of credit and operating leases discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plans 
as of december   we maintain three defined benefit pension plans one each in the us  the us and france 
the majority of the discussion below relates to the us and uk plans  as the french plan is not material to our consolidated balance sheets  statements of income or statements of cash flows 
we recorded net consolidated pension expense of million in  million in and million in pension expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
the discount rate we utilize for determining pension expense or income and pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds to year maturities that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies  composite indices provided by our actuaries and discount rates derived from our expected cash flows for each of our us defined benefit pension and opeb plans 
changes in our discount rate over the past three years reflect the fluctuations in such bond rates during that period 
we establish a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense or income for the subsequent year 
we used the following discount rate assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in us plan uk plan in developing our expected long term rate of return assumptions  we evaluate historical market rates of return and input from our actuaries  including a review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity large cap  small cap and international and bond corporate and government indices as well as anticipation that the plans active investment managers will generate premiums above the standard market projections 
we used the following long term rate of return assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans long term rates of return used for pension expense for the year ended december us plan uk plan lowering the expected long term rate of return on our us plan s assets by from to would have decreased pension income by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased our us plan s pension income by approximately million 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our uk plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased our uk plan s pension expense by approximately million 
all of our us plan s assets are invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt 
the cmrt is a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefit plans sponsored by contran and related companies 
a sub account of the cmrt held of timet common stock at december   however  our plan assets are invested only in the portion of the cmrt that does not hold timet common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
mr 
simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the trustee of the cmrt  along with the cmrt s investment committee  of which mr 
simmons is a member  actively manages the investments of the cmrt 
the trustee and investment committee periodically change the asset mix of the cmrt based upon  among other things  advice from third party advisors and their respective expectations as to what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
at december   the asset mix for our portion of the cmrt based on an aggregate asset value of million was debt securities  us equity securities  foreign equity securities and cash and other securities 
during  and  the assumed long term rate of return for our us plan assets that were invested in the cmrt was 
in determining the appropriateness of the long term rate of return assumption  we considered  among other things  the historical rates of return  the current and projected asset mix and the investment objectives of the cmrt s managers for our portion of the cmrt 
during the history of the cmrt from its inception in through december   the average annual rate of return earned by our portion of the cmrt  as calculated based on the average percentage change in the net asset value per unit for each applicable year  has been 
for our uk plan  as a result of market fluctuations experienced and the strategic movement toward our long term funding and asset allocation strategies  actual asset allocation as of december  was equity securities and debt and other securities 
our future expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our uk plan is based on our target asset allocation assumption of equity securities and fixed income securities and all current contributions to the plan are invested wholly in fixed income securities in order to gradually affect the shift 
based on various factors  including economic and market conditions  gains on the plan assets during each of the preceding years and projected asset mix  our assumed long term rate of return for our pension expense was for  for and for because all contributions continue to be put into fixed income securities  we expect the asset mix for our uk plan to continue to move closer to the projected mix  which reflects a higher percentage of fixed income securities 
although the expected rate of return is a long term measure  we continue to evaluate our expected rate of return annually and adjust it as considered necessary 
as part of this evaluation  we considered the historical long term average annual rates of return and recent economic downturn impacting virtually all global equity markets  and based on our evaluation  the recent declines in value for our plans assets are not indicative of a long term trend requiring an adjustment to our long term expected rate of return for any of our defined benefit pension plans 
actual returns on plan assets for a given year that are greater than the assumed rates of return result in an actuarial gain  while actual returns on plan assets for a given year that are less than the assumed rates of return result in an actuarial loss 
all of these actuarial gains and losses are not recognized in earnings currently  but instead are deferred and amortized into income in the future as part of pension expense 
however  any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative actuarial gains 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  we estimate that our us plan will have pension expense of approximately million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
a increase or decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions including an exchange rate of  we estimate that pension expense for our uk plan will approximate million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
a increase or decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
actual future pension expense will depend on actual future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans 
we made cash contributions of million in  million in and nil in to our us plan and cash contributions of approximately million in and million in each of and to our uk plan 
the contribution to our uk plan included a million discretionary contribution 
based upon the current funded status of the plans and the actuarial assumptions being used for  we believe that we will be required to make contributions of million to our uk plan and none to our uk plan in the current global economic downturn has negatively impacted the performance of each plans assets during  and as a result  the fair values of the plans assets have decreased significantly over the last year 
the fair value of the assets of the us plan was million at december   million at december  and at december   and the fair value of the assets of the uk plan was million at december   million at december  and million at december  the combination of actual investment returns  changing discount rates and changes in other assumptions has a significant effect on our funded plan status plan assets compared to projected benefit obligations 
the effect of positive investment returns and an increase in the discount rate increased the overfunded status of the us plan from million at december  to million at december   and the effect of negative investment returns and a decrease to the discount rate during resulted in an underfunded status of million at december  in the effect of positive investment returns and an increase in the discount rate for our uk plan  more than offset the effect of the weakening dollar compared to the british pound sterling  thereby reducing the underfunded status of the uk plan from million at december  to million at december  during  negative investment returns and a strengthening dollar versus the pound sterling both contributed to an increase in the underfunded status of our uk plan while the increase in the discount rate partially offset these effects  thereby increasing the underfunded status for our uk plan to million at december  postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
we provide limited opeb benefits to a portion of our us employees upon retirement 
we fund such opeb benefits as they are incurred  net of any retiree contributions 
we paid opeb benefits  net of retiree contributions  of million in and million in each of and we recorded consolidated opeb expense of million in  million in and million in opeb expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term health care trend rate 
the discount rate we utilize for determining opeb expense and opeb obligations is the same as that used for our us pension plan 
lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have had a nominal impact on our opeb expense 
we estimate the expected long term health care trend rate based upon input from specialists in this area  as provided by our actuaries 
in estimating the health care trend rate  we consider industry trends  our actual healthcare cost experience and our future benefit structure 
for  we used a beginning health care trend rate of 
if the health care trend rate were increased or decreased by for each year  opeb expense would have increased or decreased by approximately million in  respectively 
for  we are using a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to reduce to an ultimate rate of in based on a discount rate of  a health care trend rate as discussed above and various other assumptions  we estimate that opeb expense will approximate million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a nominal impact on estimated opeb expense in a increase or decrease in the health care trend rate for each year would increase or decrease the estimated service and interest cost components of opeb expense by approximately million in  respectively 
based upon the actuarial assumptions being used in  we believe we will be required to pay opeb benefits of million in  net of retiree contributions and a medicare part d federal subsidy 
environmental matters 
see business regulatory and environmental matters in item and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of environmental matters 
affiliate transactions 
corporations that may be deemed to be controlled by or affiliated with mr 
simmons sometimes engage in i intercorporate transactions such as guarantees  management and expense sharing arrangements  shared fee arrangements  joint ventures  partnerships  loans  options  advances of funds on open account  and sales  leases and exchanges of assets  including securities issued by both related and unrelated parties  and ii common investment and acquisition strategies  business combinations  reorganizations  recapitalizations  securities repurchases  and purchases and sales and other acquisitions and dispositions of subsidiaries  divisions or other business units  which transactions have involved both related and unrelated parties and have included transactions which resulted in the acquisition by one related party of a publicly held minority equity interest in another related party 
we continuously consider reviews and evaluate such transactions  and understand that contran and related entities consider  review and evaluate such transactions 
depending upon the business  tax and other objectives then relevant  it is possible that we might be a party to one or more such transactions in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain related party transactions that we were a party to during  and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to indebtedness 
we typically do not enter into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage our interest rate market risk 
we had no outstanding bank indebtedness at december  and our borrowings accrue interest at variable rates  generally related to spreads over bank prime rates and libor 
because our bank indebtedness reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such debt is believed to approximate fair value 
foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations 
we do not enter into currency forward contracts to manage our foreign exchange market risk associated with receivables  payables or indebtedness denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the particular entity 
see results of operations european operations in item md a for further discussion 
commodity prices 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in commodity prices as a result of our long term purchase and supply agreements with certain suppliers and customers 
these agreements  which offer various fixed or formula determined pricing arrangements  effectively obligate us to bear i the risk of increased raw material and other costs to us that cannot be passed on to our customers through increased titanium product prices in whole or in part or ii the risk of decreasing raw material costs to our suppliers that are not passed on to us in the form of lower raw material prices 
however  our ability to offset increased material costs with higher selling prices increased in the last several years  as many of our ltas have either expired or have been renegotiated with price adjustments that take into account raw material  labor and energy cost fluctuations 
securities prices 
as of december  and  we held certain marketable securities that are exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the securities 
the aggregate market value of these equity securities was million at december  and million at december  the potential change in the aggregate market value of these securities  assuming a change in prices  would have been nominal at december  and million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest bearing notes receivable 
we held a note receivable from compx with the principal amount of million at december  and million at december  our note receivable accrues interest at variable rates  related to the spread over libor 
because our note receivable reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such note receivable is believed to approximate fair value 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we held a note receivable from contran with the principal amount of million at december  our note receivable accrues interest at variable rates  related to the spread under prime 
because our note receivable reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such note receivable is believed to approximate fair value
