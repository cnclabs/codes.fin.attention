table of contents dividend policy and share repurchase programs dividend policy and payment of dividends 
our board of directors has followed the policy of retaining earnings to support the growth of the company s banking franchise  but will consider paying cash dividends based on a number of factors  including prevailing market conditions and the availability and alternative uses that can be made of cash in excess of the requirements of the company s business 
pursuant to that policy  in february  the board of directors declared a one time cash dividend  in the amount of per share of common stock  that was paid on march  to all shareholders of record as of february  it continues to be the policy of the board to retain earnings to support future growth and  at the present time  there are no plans to declare any additional cash dividends 
however  the board of directors intends from time to time to consider the advisability of paying additional dividends in the future 
any such decision will be based on a number of factors  including the company s financial performance  its available cash resources and any competing needs for cash that the company may have 
share repurchase programs 
in june  our board of directors concluded that  at prevailing market prices  the company s shares represented an attractive investment opportunity and  therefore  that repurchases of company shares would be a good use of company funds 
as a result  the board of directors approved a share repurchase program  which authorized the company to purchase up to two percent of the company s outstanding common shares  which are approximately  shares in total 
we have purchased  shares  with approximately  shares remaining to be purchased  under this program 
in october  the board of directors approved a new share repurchase plan which authorizes the company to purchase up to an additional million of its shares of common stock 
no shares have yet been purchased pursuant to this program 
these programs  which were publicly announced on july  and october   respectively  provide for share repurchases to be made in the open market or in private transactions  in accordance with applicable securities and exchange commission rules  when opportunities become available to purchase shares at prices believed to be attractive 
we are not under any obligation to repurchase any additional shares under these share repurchase programs and the timing  actual number and value of shares that we may repurchase under these programs will depend on a number of factors  including our financial performance and available cash resources  competing uses for our corporate funds  prevailing market prices of our common stock and the number of shares that become available for sale at prices that we conclude are attractive  as well as any regulatory requirements applicable to us 
the following table sets forth information regarding our share repurchases in each of the months during the fourth quarter ended december  a b c d total number of shares purchased average price paid per share total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced programs maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the programs october to october  november to november  december to december  total we have assumed  for purposes of this table  that  shares will be the maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the share repurchase program approved in october  based on assumed average purchase price of per share 
that assumed purchase price has been used solely for purposes of preparing this table and is not intended to be indicative of the future prices of our common stock 
as a result  the maximum number of shares that may ultimately be purchased under this program may ultimately prove to be less or greater than  shares 

table of contents these share repurchase programs do not have expiration dates 
however  the company may elect i to suspend share repurchases at any time or from time to time  or ii to terminate the programs prior to the repurchase of all of the shares authorized for repurchase under these programs 
accordingly  there is no assurance that any additional shares will be repurchased under these programs 
restrictions on the payment of dividends cash dividends from the bank represent the principal source of funds available to the bancorp  which it might use to pay dividends or for other corporate purposes  such as expansion of its business 
therefore  government regulations  including the laws of the state of california  as they pertain to the payment of cash dividends by california state chartered banks  limit the amount of funds that would be available to the bancorp to pay cash dividends or fund other expenditures by the bancorp in the future 
in particular  under california law  cash dividends by a california state chartered bank may not exceed  in any calendar year  the lesser of i the sum of its net income for the year and its retained net income from the preceding two years after deducting all dividends paid during the period  or ii the amount of its retained earnings 
at december   the bank s retained earnings totaled approximately million 
additionally  because the payment of cash dividends has the effect of reducing capital  the capital requirements imposed on bank holding companies and commercial banks often operate  as a practical matter  to preclude the payment  or limit the amount of  cash dividends that might otherwise be permitted by california law  and the federal bank regulatory agencies  as part of their supervisory powers  generally require insured banks to adopt dividend policies which limit the payment of cash dividends much more strictly than do applicable state laws 
restrictions on intercompany transactions section a of the federal reserve act limits the amounts that a bank may loan to its bank holding company to an aggregate of no more than of the bank subsidiary s capital surplus and retained earnings and requires that such loans be secured by specified assets of the bank holding company see business supervision and regulation restrictions on transactions between the bank and the company and its other affiliates 
we do not have any present intention to obtain any borrowings from the bank

the consequences of those operating trends on our business and the realization of our expected future financial results  which are discussed in those forward looking statements  are subject to the uncertainties and risks that are described above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
due to those uncertainties and risks and the uncertainties with respect to the duration and effects of those operating trends on our business  our future financial performance may differ  possibly significantly  from the performance that is currently expected as set forth in the forward looking statements

background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is pacific mercantile bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 

table of contents overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth information comparing our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operations in the years ended december  and year ended december amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands  except per share data interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss per share data diluted income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net income loss per share diluted weighted average number of diluted shares net of taxes 
as the above table indicates  in we incurred a net loss of million as compared to net income of million in  due to a number of factors  the most important of which was the worsening of the economic recession which led to i significant increases in defaults by borrowers of their loans  which required us to recognize losses on those loans and to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses and ii a decrease in our net interest income 
the following provides an overview of the more significant changes in our operating results in fiscal  which are discussed in greater detail in the discussion that follows this overview 
increase in loan losses and in the provision for loan losses 
the adverse effects of the worsening economic recession are reflected in the provisions that we made for loan losses in fiscal during  we made provisions for loan losses totaling almost million  as compared to approximately million for fiscal  in order to i to provide for loan charge offs and write downs totaling million  and ii to increase the allowance for loan losses after giving effect to those loan charge offs and write downs  to approximately million at december  the increase in loan write downs and our decision to significantly increase our loan loss reserves were primarily attributable to a substantial increase in loan defaults by borrowers who were adversely affected by the worsening economic recession and uncertainties as to its continued duration and future severity 
decrease in net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million  or  in fiscal  despite an increase in lending  primarily as a result of an million  or  decrease in interest income that was primarily attributable to a reduction in prevailing market rates of interest resulting from interest rate reductions implemented by the federal reserve board to stimulate the economy and spur borrowings by businesses and consumers 
due to those federal reserve board actions  the prime rate of interest  which is the rate we charge on a large portion of the loans we make  decreased by basis points from the beginning to the end of those federal reserve board interest rate reductions also enabled us to reduce the interest rates we paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities  which led to a million  or  decrease in interest expense that partially offset the reduction in interest income in 
table of contents increase in noninterest income 
noninterest income increased by  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase of million in gains on securities available for sale  and a  increase in transaction fees and service charges  offset by a million impairment in the carrying value of certain available for sale securities 
increase in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased by million  or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to i a million increase in in expenses incurred in connection with real properties acquired from borrowers on or in lieu of foreclosures commonly referred to as real estate owned or reo  and ii an  increase of salaries and employee benefits due principally to the addition of loan officers 
partially offsetting these increases was a  decrease in amortization of debt issuance costs 
income tax benefit 
our net loss reflects the recognition of an income tax benefit of million for  net of a valuation allowance of million 
this income tax benefit was primarily attributable to the loss incurred in and an increase in deferred tax benefits  consisting principally of tax credit carryforwards and income tax deductions 
set forth below are certain key financial performance ratios and other financial data from continuing operations for the periods indicated year ended december  return on average assets return on average shareholders equity ratio of average equity to average assets net interest margin net interest income expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets 
changes in financial condition to reduce our exposure to the deteriorating conditions in the real estate market  we have been reducing the volume of single family residential and real estate construction loans since the fourth quarter of  while increasing the volume of commercial and business loans 
as a result  as of december   single family residential and real estate construction loans accounted for of the loans in our loan portfolio  as compared to at december  we believe that these reductions in the volume of real estate related loans  together with our actions in charging off non performing loans and significantly increasing the allowance for loan losses  have improved the quality of our loan portfolio and  at the same time  has enhanced our ability to absorb additional loan losses that may occur as a result of the continuing economic recession 
the net loss in reduced shareholders equity by million to million and our tangible book value per share to at december  from million and  respectively  at december  however  notwithstanding the net loss in and the resulting decrease in shareholders equity  the ratio of our total capital to risk weighted assets  which is the principal federal regulatory measure of the financial strength of banking institutions  was 
as a result  we continued to be classified  under bank regulatory guidelines  as a well capitalized banking institution  which is the highest of the capital standards established under federal banking regulations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and general practices in the banking industry 
certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies  because they require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets 
those estimates and assumptions are made based on current information available to us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances 
if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our estimates or assumptions were based  or other unanticipated events were to occur that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates and to reduce the carrying values of the affected assets on our balance sheet  generally by means of charges against income 
our critical accounting policies relate to the determination of our allowance for loan losses  the fair value of securities available for sale and the realizability  and hence the valuation  of our deferred tax asset 
allowance for loan losses 
the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining the sufficiency of the allowance we establish for possible loan losses require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market 
table of contents conditions and trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations to us 
accordingly  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current economic and market conditions  other economic indicators and applicable bank regulatory guidelines  to determine the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
if unanticipated changes were to occur in those conditions or trends  or the financial condition of borrowers were to deteriorate  or there were changes to these loss factors or regulatory guidelines  actual loan losses could be greater than those that had previously been predicted 
in such an event  it could become necessary for us to increase the allowance for loan losses by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of the loans on our balance sheet  and the additional provision for loan losses taken to increase that allowance would reduce our income in the period when it is determined that an increase in the allowance for loan losses is necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  federal bank regulatory agencies adopted new and more stringent guidelines and methodologies for identifying losses in bank loan portfolios and determining the sufficiency of loan loss reserves  due to the worsening of the economic recession and the prospects that conditions would not improve during we applied those new guidelines and methodologies beginning in the fourth quarter of and we will continue applying them in see the discussion in the subsections entitled provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 
fair value of securities available for sale 
we determine the fair value of our investment securities by obtaining quotes from third party vendors and securities brokers 
when quotes are not available  a reasonable fair value is determined by using a variety of industry standard pricing methodologies including  but not limited to  discounted cash flow analysis  matrix pricing  option adjusted spread models  as well as fundamental analysis 
these pricing methodologies require us to make various assumptions relating to such matters as future prepayment speeds  yield  duration  monetary policy and demand and supply for the individual securities 
consequently  if changes were to occur in the market or other conditions on which those assumptions were based  it could become necessary for us to reduce the fair values of our securities  which would result in changes to accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheet 
if the company determines reductions in the fair values of any securities are other than temporary  it will be necessary for the company to take an impairment loss directly to our income statement 
utilization and valuation of deferred income tax benefits 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for tax credits 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability using a consistent approach that considers the relative impact of negative and positive evidence  including our historical profitability and projections of future taxable income 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income or stockholders equity if we determine  based on available evidence at the time the determination is made  that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans and ongoing tax planning strategies 
this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between our projected operating performance  our actual results and other factors 
accordingly  we have included the assessment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a critical accounting policy 
our deferred tax assets increased to million at december   net of a non cash charge of million that we recorded to establish a partial deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
discontinued business in the second quarter  the bank sold pmb securities corp  our retail securities brokerage business  which had been operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of the bancorp 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the operating results of the retail securities brokerage business has been classified as discontinued operations and prior period financial statements were restated on that same basis 
see selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
additionally  as a result of the sale of the securities brokerage business  our commercial banking business constitutes our continuing operations and the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on its operations 
results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is its net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board which affect interest rates  the demand for loans by prospective borrowers  the competition among banks and other lending institutions for loans and deposits  and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest income decreased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of an million  or  decrease in interest income that more than offset a million  or  decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest income in over was due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate earned i on loans to in from in  and ii on short term investments to in from in  primarily as a result of the interest rate reductions implemented by the federal reserve board during 
table of contents the average interest rate on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities declined to in from in  primarily due to those same interest rate reductions by the federal reserve board  which enabled us to reduce interest rates on deposits and benefit from reductions in interest rates on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin for fiscal decreased to in from in fiscal  as the decrease in interest income was greater than the decrease in interest expense in  because the beneficial impact of the decline in interest rates on our interest expense in was partially offset by the effects on interest expense of i an increase in the volume of our deposits and ii a change in the mix of our deposits to a higher proportion of time deposits on which we pay higher rates of interest than on other deposits and a lower proportion of non interest bearing deposits 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest decreased by  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in interest expense that more than offset a million  or increase in interest income 
the increase in interest expense in over was due primarily to i increases of million in the average volume of our time deposits  on which we pay higher rates of interest than on core deposits  and ii an increase in the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities to in from in  primarily as a result of the increases in interest rates promulgated by the federal reserve board during the first nine months of the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to i an increase of million  or  in the average volume of our outstanding loans during fiscal over fiscal and ii an increase in yields on interest earning assets to in from in  due primarily to the effects of interest rate increases by the federal reserve board in furtherance of its national monetary policies 
we funded the increase in loan volume by increasing the volume of interest bearing deposits and with funds generated by sales of securities held for sale 
our net interest margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal that decrease was primarily attributable to the overall increase in deposits  together with a change in the mix of our deposits to a higher proportion of time deposits and a lower proportion of non interest bearing deposits  in compared to  which caused our interest expense to increase at a faster rate than did our interest income

table of contents the above table indicates that in declines in interest rates resulted in a million decline in net interest income  partially offset by a  increase in net interest income attributable to increased loan volume 
in  declines in interest rates resulted in a million decrease in net interest income  partially offset by a million increase in net interest income that was attributable to increases in the volumes of loans and short term investments 
provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining an allowance for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced written down to what management believes is its realizable value or  if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value  the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety a loan charge off 
loan charge offs and write downs are charged against that allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is increased periodically i to replenish the allowance after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs  ii to reflect increases in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or adverse changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below in this section of this report 
increases in the allowance for loan losses are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of operations  referred to as the provision for loan losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance and  therefore  have the effect of increasing the allowance and reducing the amount of the provision that might otherwise have to be made to replenish or increase the allowance 
we employ or if changes were made to regulatory guidelines  industry standards and historical loan loss experience to determine both the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and  the amount of the provisions that are required to be made for potential loan losses 
however  those determinations involve judgments about trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us 
the duration and anticipated effects of prevailing economic conditions or trends can be uncertain and could be affected by number of risks and circumstances that are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors we could incur losses on the loans we make 
if changes in economic or market conditions or unexpected subsequent events were to occur  or if changes were made to bank regulatory guidelines or industry standards that are used to assess the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses  it could become necessary to incur additional  and possibly significant  charges to increase the allowance for loan losses  which would have the effect of reducing our income or causing us to incur losses 
in addition  the frb and the california department of financial institutions the dfi  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses  over and above the provisions that we have already made  the effect of which would be to reduce our income 
in fiscal we made provisions for possible loan of million  as compared to million in that increase was due to a million in loan charge offs and write downs and increases in non performing loans  primarily consisting of real estate related loans  and a decision to increase the allowance for loans losses at december  to million after giving effect to those loan charge offs and write downs 
the principal factors that led us to make that decision were i the worsening of the economic recession during the second half of and uncertainties with respect to its duration and ultimate severity  which increased the risks of loan defaults by borrowers  and ii a million increase in the volume of outstanding loans

the increase in noninterest expense in was primarily attributable to i an increase in the number of real properties acquired on or in lieu of foreclosure  which caused us to incur expenses of nearly million as compared to just  in  and ii a  increase in salaries and employee benefits due primarily to the addition  during  of new loan officers at the bank  partially offset by a  decrease in the amortization of debt issuance costs 
in fiscal  noninterest expense increased by million or  compared to fiscal  due primarily to i the early redemption  in the third quarter of  of million principal amount of junior subordinated debentures as a result of which we recognized a non cash charge of  representing the original issuance costs of those debentures that we had formerly been amortizing over their original year term  and ii increases  mandated by the federal deposit insurance reform act of  in fdic insurance assessments payable by all fdic insured banking institutions 
a measure of our ability to control noninterest expense is our efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expense to net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income 
as a general rule  a lower efficiency ratio indicates an ability to generate increased revenue without a commensurate increase in the staffing and equipment and third party services and  therefore  would be indicative of greater operational efficiencies 
however  a bank s efficiency ratio can be adversely affected by factors such as the opening of new banking offices or in the bank s case  the impact of additional reo expenses 
as a result of the decrease in our net interest income and the increase in noninterest expense in  our efficiency ratio was in  as compared to in and in income tax expense benefit due primarily to the pre tax loss we incurred in  our deferred tax assets increased from million at december  to million  net of a valuation allowance of million  at december  we recognized and established the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount we considered to be recoverable after we had made a determination that it had become less likely than not that we would be able to use the tax deductions and tax credit carryforwards comprising the deferred tax assets  in full  prior to their expiration 
the valuation allowance was established by a non cash charge to our statement of operations that was reflected in the income tax benefit recorded for the factors that led us to record a partial valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets are discussed above in critical accounting policies utilization and valuation of deferred income tax benefits of this item and in the notes to consolidated financial statements note  income taxes 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods 
we will continue to monitor available evidence related to our ability to utilize our remaining deferred tax assets 
if we determine  in the future  that a full recovery of our remaining deferred tax assets has become unlikely  we would record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate may not be recoverable 
our income tax expense or benefit in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases to our valuation allowance 

table of contents financial condition assets our total consolidated assets increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december   primarily as a result of i an increase in the volume of our outstanding loans  which was primarily attributable to the addition of new loan officers and the growth of our lending business  and ii an increase in cash and cash equivalents during to increase our liquidity in response to the worsening of the economic recession and its impact on california  which has seen significant declines in real property values  increases in real estate foreclosures and sharp increases in unemployment which exceeds the national average 
this increase in outstanding loans was funded primarily by increases in time deposits

investment policy and securities available for sale our investment policy is designed to provide for our liquidity needs and to generate a favorable return on investment without undue interest rate risk  credit risk or asset concentrations 
our investment policy authorizes us to invest in obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the united states government  certain federal agency obligations  time deposits issued by federally insured depository institutions  municipal securities and in federal funds sold  provides that the weighted average maturities of us government obligations and federal agency securities cannot exceed years and municipal obligations cannot exceed years  provides that time deposits that we maintain at other financial institutions must be placed with federally insured financial institutions  cannot exceed the maximum fdic insured amount in any one institution and may not have a maturity exceeding months  and prohibits engaging in securities trading activities 
securities available for sale 
securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but which may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs  in interest rates  or in prepayment risks or other similar factors  are classified as securities available for sale 
such securities are recorded on our balance sheet at their respective fair values and increases or decreases in those values are recorded as unrealized gains or losses  respectively  and are reported as other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheet  rather than included in or deducted from our earnings

expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities and historical prepayments  particularly with respect to collateralized mortgage obligations  because changes in interest rates will affect the timing and the extent of prepayments by borrowers

the allowance for loan losses at december  was million  which represented approximately of the loans outstanding at december   as compared to million  or  of the loans outstanding at december  this increase in the allowance for loan losses was primarily attributable to i the deteriorating economy during the second half of  and uncertainties as to the duration and ultimate severity  of the current economic recession and ii the application of new and more stringent guidelines and methodologies for assessing the sufficiency of the allowance that were recently adopted by bank regulatory agencies largely in response to these economic conditions and uncertainties 
see results of operations provision for loan losses above 

table of contents we carefully monitor changing economic conditions  the loan portfolio by category  the financial condition of borrowers  the history of the loan portfolio  and we follow bank regulatory guidelines in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we believe that the allowance at december  was adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  as the volume of loans increases  additional provisions for loan losses will be required to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
additionally  the allowance was established on the basis of assumptions and judgments regarding such matters as economic conditions and trends  the financial condition of borrowers  and historical industry loan loss data and bank regulatory guidelines and  if there were changes in those economic conditions or trends or in applicable bank regulatory guidelines  actual loan losses in the future could be greater  possibly to a significant extent  than the losses that had been predicted on the basis of those earlier assumptions  judgments and guidelines 
see results of operations provision for loan losses above  which includes a table that sets forth the changes in the allowance for loan losses in each of the years in the five year period ended december  the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories at the dates indicated below 
the allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that loans charged to the allowance will occur in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories as the total allowance is applicable to the entire loan portfolio

substantially all of the loans in our loan portfolio are graded in the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
non performing loans 
we also measure and establish reserves for loan impairments on a loan by loan basis using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we exclude  from our impairment calculations  smaller  homogeneous loans such as consumer installment loans and lines of credit 
also  loans that experience insignificant payment delays or shortfalls are generally not considered impaired 
we cease accruing interest and  therefore  classify as nonaccrual  any loan as to which principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more  or if repayment in full of interest or principal is not expected 
the following table sets forth  as of the dates indicated below  the amount of adequately collateralized or reserved loans that were days or more delinquent and which were classified as nonaccrual loans at december  in thousands 
table of contents we had no loans with delinquent balances of days or more that were still accruing interest as of december    or  whereas we had  in principal balances more than days past due and still accruing interest at december  at december   we carried million of restructured loans of which million were classified as non accrual loans and million were classified as accruing and performing in accordance to the modification agreements

table of contents liquidity we actively manage our liquidity needs to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our cash requirements and  thereby  provide for the ongoing needs of our customers for cash 
we project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain sufficient liquid funds for unanticipated events 
our primary sources of cash include i payments on loans  and ii the sale or maturity of investments  iii growth in deposits  and iv borrowings 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on our customers lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding deposit withdrawals  reducing outstanding borrowings and paying operating expenses 
we maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
we also have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions which can be drawn upon to meet any additional liquidity requirements 
as of december   we had unused borrowing capacity of million with the federal home loan bank and million of additional borrowing capacity in the form of security repurchase agreements with two investment banking firms and unused federal funds lines of credit of million with correspondent banks 
our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock totaled million or of total assets at december   as compared to million or of total assets at december  cash flow from operating activities 
during the year ended december   operations provided million of cash flow 
cash flow used in investing activities 
in the year ended december   we used cash flow of million in investing activities  primarily to fund an increase of million in loans  which was funded in substantial part by million in cash generated by sales of securities available for sale  offset by the purchase of million of securities available for sale 
cash flow provided by financing activities 
cash flow of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   the source of which consisted primarily of a net increase of million in deposits and million of additional borrowings 
the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides a useful measure of our liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields and higher interest income on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on assets 
at december   the ratio of loans to deposits was  compared to at december  although our loans to deposits ratio was at december   we were able to maintain what we believe is adequate liquidity by means of federal home loan bank borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  we had outstanding commitments to fund loans totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made can be as much as the amount of those commitments assuming amounts drawn by customer total of their commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we 
table of contents would apply if we were approving loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
as a consequence  our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations borrowings 
as of december   we had million of outstanding short term borrowings and million of outstanding long term borrowings that we had obtained from the federal home loan bank

table of contents junior subordinated debentures 
pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies are permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that will  subject to certain conditions  qualify as and  therefore  augment capital for regulatory purposes 
pursuant to those rulings  in  we formed subsidiary grantor trusts to sell and issue to institutional investors a total of million principal amount of floating junior trust preferred securities trust preferred securities

the payment terms of the debentures mirror those of the trust preferred securities and the payments that we make of interest and principal on the debentures are used by the grantor trusts to make the payments that come due to the holders of the trust preferred securities pursuant to the terms of those securities 
the debentures also were pledged by the grantor trusts as security for their payment obligations under the trust preferred securities 
the debentures are redeemable at our option  without premium or penalty  beginning five years after their respective original issue dates  require quarterly or semi annual interest payments 
subject to certain conditions  we have the right  at our discretion  to defer those interest payments for up to five years 
however  we have no plans to exercise this deferral right

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk arises from the instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  securities  deposit liabilities  and short term borrowings 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as market interest rates change 
our interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset liability framework 
asset liability management the primary objective of asset liability management is to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  which can affect our net interest margins and  therefore  our net interest income and net earnings 
we seek to achieve this objective by matching interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintaining the maturities and the repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels in light of the prevailing interest rate environment 
generally  all other things being equal  i when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  net interest income will be positively impacted during a rising interest rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining interest rate environment  and ii when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  net interest income generally will be positively impacted during a declining interest rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising interest rate environment 
the table below sets forth information concerning our rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  the assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of maturity or repricing dates in accordance with their contractual terms 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the following table  which are discussed below 
three months or less over three through twelve months over one year through five years over five years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest bearing time deposits in other financial institutions investment in unconsolidated trust subsidiaries securities available for sale federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions loans  gross non interest earning assets  net total assets liabilities and shareholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowings junior subordinated debentures other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative of rate sensitive assets in maturity period rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities n a cumulative ratio as the above table indicates  at december  our rate sensitive assets exceeded our rate sensitive liabilities and  as a result  our rate sensitive balance sheet was shown to be in a positive twelve month gap position 
this implies that our net interest margin would increase in the short term if interest rates rise and would decrease in the short term if interest rates were to fall 

table of contents however  the extent to which our net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interests rates will depend on a number of factors  including how quickly rate sensitive assets and liabilities react to interest rate changes  the mix of our interest earning assets loans versus other interest earning assets  such as securities and the mix of our interest bearing deposits between for example  lower cost core deposits and higher cost time certificates of deposit and our other interest bearing liabilities 
it is not uncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag behind changes in market rates of interest 
additionally  prepayments of loans and securities available for sale  and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit  could cause the interest sensitivities to vary 
the rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the table above also assumes that we would make no changes in the mix of our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities in response to changes in the interest rate environment  which is not consistent with our practices 
as a result  the relationship or gap between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  as shown in the above table  is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing rates of interest on our net interest income is likely to be different from that predicted on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the above table
