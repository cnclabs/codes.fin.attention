we generally sell these devices at prices below our cost in response to competition  to attract new subscribers and as retention inducements for existing subscribers 
we sell accessories  such as carrying cases  hands free devices  batteries  battery chargers and other items to subscribers  and we sell handsets and accessories to agents and other third party distributors for resale 
wireless network technologies we provide our sprint branded post paid  some of our boost mobile branded prepaid and wholesale wireless services over our cdma network  an all digital wireless network with spectrum licenses that allow us to provide service in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
the cdma network uses a single frequency band and a digital spread spectrum wireless technology that allows a large number of users to access the band by assigning a code to all voice and data bits  sending a scrambled transmission of the encoded bits over 
table of contents the air and reassembling the voice and data into its original format 
we provide nationwide service through a combination of operating our own digital network in both major and smaller us metropolitan areas and rural connecting routes using cdma technology  affiliations under commercial arrangements with third party affiliates  or pcs affiliates  and roaming on other providers networks 
we provide our nextel branded post paid and most of our boost mobile branded prepaid wireless services over our iden network 
our iden network is an all digital packet data network based on iden wireless technology provided by motorola  inc we are the only national wireless service provider in the united states that utilizes iden technology and  generally  the iden handsets that we currently offer are not enabled to roam on wireless networks that do not utilize iden technology 
iden is a proprietary technology that relies principally on our and motorola s efforts for further research  product development and innovation 
for additional information  see item a  risk factors if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and handsets in support of our iden based services  as well as anticipated handset and infrastructure improvements for those services  our operations will be adversely affected 
beginning in  our subscribers in certain markets will also have access to clearwire s wimax network through a mobile virtual network operator  or mvno  arrangement that enables us to resell clearwire s g wireless services under the sprint brand name 
the services supported by wimax give subscribers with compatible devices high speed access to the internet 
this relationship with clearwire was developed through a transaction that closed on november   at which time we and clearwire corporation and its subsidiary clearwire communications llc  which we refer to in this form k on a consolidated basis as clearwire  joined together to combine our next generation wireless broadband businesses 
at closing  we contributed billion of net assets  including our gigahertz  or ghz  spectrum and wimax related assets 
in exchange  we received million class b common shares and common interests in clearwire corporation and clearwire communications llc  respectively  which as of february  after settlement of the post closing day ownership adjustment  represents approximately of the voting power of clearwire corporation and approximately of the economic interests in clearwire communications 
although we have a interest in clearwire  we do not control the company 
sales  marketing and customer care we focus the marketing and sales of wireless services on targeted groups of subscribers individual consumers  businesses and government subscribers 
we offer a variety of pricing options and plans  including value driven plans designed specifically for business subscribers  individuals and families  including the simply everything plans and boost mobile prepaid plans 
we use a variety of sales channels to attract new subscribers of wireless services  including direct sales representatives whose efforts are focused on marketing and selling cdma and iden based wireless services primarily to mid sized to large businesses and government agencies that value our industry and technical expertise and extensive product and service portfolio  as well as our ability to develop custom communications capabilities that meet the specific needs of these larger subscribers  retail outlets that focus on sales to the consumer market  including sprint nextel retail stores owned and operated by us  as well as third party retailers  indirect sales agents that primarily consist of local and national non affiliated dealers and independent contractors that market and sell services to small businesses and the consumer market  and are generally paid through commissions  and customer convenient channels  including web sales and telesales 
we market our post paid services under the sprint and nextel brands 
we offer these services on a contract basis typically for one or two year periods  with services billed on a monthly basis according to the applicable pricing plan 
we market our prepaid services under the boost mobile brand  as a means to provide value driven prepaid service plans to particular markets 

table of contents although we market our services using traditional print and television advertising  we also provide exposure to our brand names and wireless services through various sponsorships  including the national association for stock car auto racing  or nascar  and the national football league 
the goal of these marketing initiatives is to increase brand awareness and sales 
our customer management organization works to improve our customer s experience  with the goal of retaining subscribers of our wireless services 
customer service call centers  some of which are operated by us and some of which are operated by independent contractors  receive and respond to inquiries from subscribers 
we have implemented initiatives that are designed to improve call center processes and procedures  and we measure our performance by various metrics  including customer satisfaction ratings with respect to customer care and first call resolution 
during  we completed the migration of our post paid and prepaid subscribers to a single billing platform  which we believe has increased functionality for our customer care representatives and has the potential to enhance the customer experience 
unlike the offerings under our sprint  nextel and boost brands  we do not market our wholesale services to our end user customers 
our wholesale customers are resellers of our wireless services and market their products using their brands 
competition we believe that the market for wireless services has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price  the types of services and devices offered and quality of service 
we compete with a number of wireless carriers  including three other national wireless companies at t  verizon wireless and t mobile 
our primary competitors offer voice  high speed data  entertainment and location based services and walkie talkie type features that are designed to compete with our products and services 
other competitors offer or have announced plans to introduce similar services 
at t and verizon also offer competitive wireless services packaged with local and long distance voice  high speed internet services and video 
our boost mobile branded prepaid services compete with a number of regional carriers  including metro pcs communications  inc and leap wireless international  inc  which offer competitively priced calling plans that include unlimited local calling 
competition will increase to the extent that new firms enter the market as additional radio spectrum is made available for commercial wireless services 
we also expect competition to increase as a result of other technologies and services that are developed and introduced in the future  including potentially those using unlicensed spectrum  including wireless fidelity  or wifi  and long term evolution  or lte 
wholesale services and products also contribute to increased competition 
in some instances  wholesalers that use our network and offer like services compete against our offerings 
most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services  thereby limiting the growth of subscribers of wireless services 
as the wireless market matures  it is becoming increasingly important to retain existing subscribers in addition to attracting new subscribers 
to do this  we and our competitors continue to offer more service plans that combine voice and data offerings  plans that allow users to add additional mobile devices to their plans at attractive rates  plans with a higher number of bundled minutes included in the fixed monthly charge for the plan  plans that offer the ability to share minutes among a group of related subscribers  or combinations of these features 
consumers respond to these plans by migrating to those they deem most attractive 
in addition  wireless carriers also try to appeal to subscribers by offering devices at prices significantly lower than their cost  and we may offer higher cost handsets at greater discounts than our competitors  with the expectation that the loss incurred on the device will be offset by future service revenue 
as a result  we and our competitors incur immediate losses that will not be recovered for several quarters 
our ability to compete is based on our ability to retain and attract new subscribers  which we plan to achieve by providing a good subscriber experience and strengthening our brand 
we also strive to offer relevant  high quality  differentiated products  features and services that are simple to use and understand and that allow subscribers to be productive at an attractive price 
we believe that if we are successful in delivering a value driven  simplified and productive customer experience  we will improve our profitability 
however  to the extent 
table of contents that our competitors offer  or are able to provide products  features and applications that are comparable to ours  any competitive advantage from the differentiation of our services from those of our competitors would be reduced 
to the extent that the competitive environment requires us to decrease prices or increase service and product offerings  our revenue could decline or our costs could increase 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings also may adversely impact customer retention 
see item a  risk factors if we are not able to attract and retain wireless subscribers  our financial performance will be impaired 
wireline we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services to our wireless segment  other communications companies and targeted business customers 
we are one of the nation s largest providers of internet protocol  or ip  wide area network and long distance services 
we operate an all digital long distance and gigabyte capacity tier ip network 
our strategy for the wireline segment is to deliver low cost  high quality voice and data services to our wireless segment to enable it to compete effectively  take advantage of the growth in voice services provided by cable multiple system operators  or msos  leverage available capacity by selling it to other communications service providers  and provide communications services to our business customers with a particular focus on ip voice data and wireline wireless converged services 
for our business customers  we aim to increase their productivity by helping them upgrade from older  less flexible network technologies to ip and by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining ip networks with wireless technology 
this differentiation enables us to acquire and retain both wireline only and combined wireline wireless customers on our networks 
consumers are increasing their use of cable msos as alternatives to local and long distance voice communications providers 
we are taking advantage of this development by providing large cable msos with local and long distance voice over ip  or voip  communications services  which they offer as part of their bundled service offerings 
in all of these strategies  we are utilizing our principal strategic assets our high capacity national fiber optic network  our tier ip network  our base of business customers  our established national brand and converged wireless wireline service offerings 
services and products our services and products include domestic and international data communications using various protocols such as multi protocol label switching  or mpls  ip  ip based frame relay  managed network services  voip and traditional voice services 
our ip services can be combined with our wireless services 
such services include our wireless integration service which enables a wireless handset to operate as part of a customer s wireline voice network and our datalink service  which uses our wireless networks to connect a customer location into their primarily wireline wide area ip mpls data network  making it easy for businesses to adapt their network to changing business requirements 
we also provide ip and other services to cable msos that resell our local and long distance service and or use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities primarily to residential end user customers 
although we continue to provide voice services to residential consumers  we no longer actively market those services 
our wireline segment markets and sells its services primarily through direct sales representatives 

table of contents competition our wireline segment competes with at t  verizon communications  qwest communications  level communications  inc  other major local incumbent operating companies  cable operators and other telecommunications providers in all segments of the long distance communications market 
some competitors are targeting the high end data market and are offering deeply discounted rates in exchange for high volume traffic as they attempt to utilize excess capacity in their networks 
in addition  we face increasing competition from other wireless and ip based service providers 
many carriers are competing in the residential and small business markets by offering bundled packages of both local and long distance services 
competition in long distance is based on price and pricing plans  the types of services offered  customer service  and communications quality  reliability and availability 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions and pricing strategies 
see item a  risk factors consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services  as well as consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers used for wireless services  could adversely affect our revenues and profitability and the blurring of the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services contribute to increased competition 
legislative and regulatory developments overview communications services are subject to regulation at the federal level by the fcc and in certain states by public utilities commissions  or pucs 
the communications act of  or communications act  preempts states from regulating the rates or entry of commercial mobile radio service  or cmrs  providers  such as those services provided through our wireless segment  and imposes various licensing and technical requirements implemented by the fcc  including provisions related to the acquisition  assignment or transfer of radio licenses 
cmrs providers are subject to state regulation of other terms and conditions of service 
our wireline segment also is subject to limited federal and state regulation 
the following is a summary of the regulatory environment in which we operate and does not describe all present and proposed federal  state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry 
some legislation and regulations are the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative proceedings that could change the manner in which our industry operates 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters or their potential impact on our business 
see item a  risk factors government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects  future growth or results of operations 
regulation in the communications industry is subject to change  which could adversely affect us in the future 
the following discussion describes some of the major communications related regulations that affect us  but numerous other substantive areas of regulation not discussed here may also influence our business 
regulation and wireless operations the fcc regulates the licensing  construction  operation  acquisition and sale of our wireless operations and wireless spectrum holdings 
fcc requirements impose operating and other restrictions on our wireless operations that increase our costs 
the fcc does not currently regulate rates for services offered by cmrs providers  and states are legally preempted from regulating such rates and entry into any market  although states may regulate other terms and conditions 
the communications act and fcc rules also require the fcc s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an fcc license  although the fcc s rules permit spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses  including our licenses  with fcc oversight 
approval from the federal trade commission and the department of justice  as well as state or local regulatory authorities  also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum interests 
the fcc sets rules  regulations and policies to  among other things grant licenses in the mhz band  mhz band  ghz personal communications services  or pcs  band  and license renewals  
table of contents rule on assignments and transfers of control of fcc licenses  and leases covering our use of fcc licenses held by other persons and organizations  govern the interconnection of our cdma and iden networks with other wireless and wireline carriers  establish access and universal service funding provisions  impose rules related to unauthorized use of and access to customer information  impose fines and forfeitures for violations of fcc rules  regulate the technical standards governing wireless services  and impose other obligations that it determines to be in the public interest 
we hold several kinds of licenses to deploy our services ghz pcs licenses utilized in our cdma network  and mhz and mhz licenses utilized in our iden network 
we also hold and lease ghz and other fcc licenses that we currently do not utilize in our networks or operations  but which we intend to use in the future consistent with customer demand and our obligations as a licensee 
ghz pcs license conditions all pcs licenses are granted for ten year terms 
for purposes of issuing pcs licenses  the fcc utilizes major trading areas  or mtas  and basic trading areas  or btas  with several btas making up each mta 
each license is subject to buildout requirements  and the fcc may revoke a license after a hearing if the buildout or other applicable requirements have not been met 
we have met these requirements in all of our mta and bta markets 
if applicable buildout conditions are met  these licenses may be renewed for additional ten year terms 
renewal applications are not subject to auctions 
if a renewal application is challenged  the fcc grants a preference commonly referred to as a license renewal expectancy to the applicant if the applicant can demonstrate that it has provided substantial service during the past license term and has substantially complied with applicable fcc rules and policies and the communications act 
the licenses for the mhz of spectrum in the ghz band that we received as part of the fcc s report and order  described below  have ten year terms and are not subject to specific buildout conditions  but are subject to renewal requirements that are similar to those for our pcs licenses 
mhz and mhz license conditions we hold licenses for channels in the mhz and mhz bands that are used to deploy our iden services 
because spectrum in these bands originally was licensed in small groups of channels  we hold thousands of these licenses  which together allow us to provide coverage across much of the continental united states 
our mhz and mhz licenses are subject to requirements that we meet population coverage benchmarks tied to the initial license grant dates 
to date  we have met all of these construction requirements applicable to these licenses  except in the case of licenses that are not material to our business 
our mhz and mhz licenses have ten year terms  at the end of which each license is subject to renewal requirements that are similar to those for our ghz licenses 
mhz band spectrum reconfiguration in  the fcc adopted a report and order that included new rules regarding interference in the mhz band and a comprehensive plan to reconfigure the mhz band 
the interference is believed to have been caused as a result of the operations of cmrs providers operating on frequencies adjacent to a number of public safety communication systems in the same geographic area 
we assumed the obligations inherent in the report and order in august when we merged with nextel communications  inc 
table of contents the report and order provides for the exchange of a portion of our mhz fcc spectrum licenses  and requires us to fund the cost incurred by public safety systems and other incumbent licensees to reconfigure the mhz spectrum band 
in addition  we received licenses for mhz of nationwide spectrum in the ghz band  however  we are required to relocate and reimburse the incumbent licensees in this band for their costs of relocation to another band designated by the fcc 
the report and order requires us to make a payment to the us treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the ghz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the mhz and mhz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs  or qualifying costs  that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities under the report and order 
the fcc determined under the report and order that  for purposes of calculating that payment amount  the value of the ghz spectrum is about billion and the aggregate value of the mhz spectrum and the mhz spectrum surrendered  net of mhz spectrum received as part of the exchange  is about billion  which  because of the potential payment to the us treasury  results in a minimum cash obligation of about billion by us under the report and order 
we are  however  obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed billion 
from the inception of the program through december   we have incurred approximately billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program 
when expended  these costs are generally accounted for either as property  plant and equipment or as additions to the fcc licenses intangible asset 
we estimate based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available  that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between and billion 
neither the actual amounts incurred through december   nor the range of total direct costs estimated to complete the spectrum reconfigurations  includes any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program 
this estimate is dependent on significant assumptions including the final licensee costs  and costs associated with relocating licensees in the canadian border region under the border plan that was adopted by the fcc and the mexican border region for which there is currently no approved border plan 
in addition  we are entitled to receive reimbursement from the mobile satellite service licensees for their pro rata portion of our costs of clearing a portion of the ghz spectrum 
those licensees may be unable or unwilling to reimburse us for their share of the costs  which we estimate to be approximately million 
accordingly  we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the us treasury 
the fcc has designated the independent transition administrator  or ta  to monitor  facilitate and review our expenditures for the mhz band reconfiguration 
as required under the terms of the report and order  we delivered a billion letter of credit to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum 
the report and order provides for the possibility of periodic reductions in the amount of the letter of credit 
during  we determined  based on the information available to us  that the total cost of reconfiguring the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum are likely to be less than billion 
the ta reviewed our forecasts and recommended to the fcc million in reductions in the letter of credit based on costs incurred through june  the fcc concurred with the ta s requests and the letter of credit has been reduced to billion 
with respect to timing  the report and order required the completion of the mhz band reconfiguration within a month period  ending june   with an exception made with respect to markets that border mexico and canada 
on october   the fcc released an order granting us relief we had previously requested with respect to the june  completion date whereby a staged  milestone based reduction will be used for the interleaved spectrum that we would otherwise have been required to surrender by june  in addition to defining progress benchmarks  which will determine the amount of spectrum we relinquish on a region by region basis  the fcc adopted a deadline of march   at which time we may be required to relinquish portions of our mhz interleaved spectrum in advance of completion of rebanding and receipt of 
table of contents remaining replacement spectrum 
this order alleviates the spectrum constraints we may have faced as a result of the original june  completion date 
the exception with respect to markets that border canada was clarified on may   when the fcc issued the canadian border plans which included a month deadline for completion 
new spectrum opportunities and spectrum auctions several fcc proceedings and initiatives are underway that may affect the availability of spectrum used or useful in the provision of commercial wireless services  which may allow new competitors to enter the wireless market 
we cannot predict when or whether the fcc will conduct any spectrum auctions or if it will release additional spectrum that might be useful to wireless carriers  including us  in the future 
services pursuant to fcc rules  cmrs providers  including us  are required to provide enhanced  or e  services in a two tiered manner 
specifically  wireless carriers are required to transmit to a requesting public safety answering point  or psap  both the caller s telephone number and a the location of the cell site from which the call is being made  or b the location of the customer s handset using latitude and longitude  depending upon the capability of the psap 
implementation of e service must be completed within six months of a psap request for service in its area  or longer  based on the agreement between the individual psap and carrier 
as a part of the fcc s approval of the clearwire transaction  we committed to measure the accuracy of our systems at the county level with certain exceptions 
we believe we will be able to comply with this accuracy standard using existing technology 
homeland security homeland security issues are likely to continue to receive attention at the fcc  state and local levels  and congress 
given the change in administration  we cannot predict whether any new regulatory requirements will be imposed or the cost of such requirements 
the fcc has signaled its intention to re activate its industry advisory committee on network reliability  also the fcc and the federal emergency management agency department of homeland security are likely to continue to focus on disaster preparedness and communications among first responders 
we have voluntarily agreed to provide wireless emergency alerts over our cdma network and are looking to do so over our iden network 
under the time line developed by the fcc  the provision of such alerts should begin in late or early tower siting wireless systems must comply with various federal  state and local regulations that govern the siting  lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas  including requirements imposed by the fcc and the federal aviation administration 
fcc rules subject certain cell site locations to extensive zoning  environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties  including native americans 
the fcc adopted significant changes to its rules governing historic preservation review of projects  which makes it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities 
the fcc is also considering changes to its rules regarding environmental protection as related to tower construction  which  if adopted  could make it more difficult to deploy facilities 
to the extent governmental agencies impose additional requirements on the tower siting process  the time and cost to construct cell towers could be negatively impacted 
state and local regulation while the communications act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating entry of  or the rates charged by  wireless carriers  certain state pucs and local governments regulate customer billing  termination of service arrangements  advertising  certification of operation  use of handsets when driving  service quality  sales practices  management of customer call records and protected information and many other areas 

table of contents also  some state attorneys general have become more active in bringing lawsuits related to the sales practices and services of wireless carriers 
varying practices among the states may make it more difficult for us to implement national sales and marketing programs 
states also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers  similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the fcc  and some states are requiring wireless carriers to help fund the provision of intrastate relay services for consumers who are hearing impaired 
we anticipate that these trends will continue to require us to devote legal and other resources to work with the states to respond to their concerns while attempting to minimize any new regulation and enforcement actions that could increase our costs of doing business 
regulation and wireline operations competitive local service the telecommunications act of  or telecom act  the first comprehensive update of the communications act  was designed to promote competition  and it eliminated legal and regulatory barriers for entry into local and long distance communications markets 
it also required incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  to allow resale of specified local services at wholesale rates  negotiate interconnection agreements  provide nondiscriminatory access to certain unbundled network elements and allow co location of interconnection equipment by competitors 
the rules implementing the telecom act remain subject to legal challenges 
thus  the scope of future local competition remains uncertain 
these local competition rules impact us because we provide wholesale services to cable television companies that wish to compete in the local voice telephony market 
we provide cable companies with communications and back office services to enable the cable companies to provide competitive local and long distance telephone services primarily in a voice over ip  or voip  format to their end user customers 
we are now providing these services to cable companies in a number of states while working to gain regulatory approvals and obtain interconnection agreements to enter additional markets 
certain rural ilecs continue to take steps to impede our ability to provide services to the cable companies in an efficient manner 
however  regulatory decisions in several states may speed our market entry in those states 
voice over internet protocol we offer a growing number of voip based services to business subscribers and transport voip originated traffic for various cable companies 
the fcc has not yet resolved the regulatory classification of voip services  but continues to consider the regulatory status of various forms of voip 
in  the fcc issued an order finding that one form of voip  involving a specific form of computer to computer services for which no charge is assessed and conventional telephone numbers are not used  is an unregulated information service  rather than a telecommunications service  and preempted state regulation of this service 
the fcc also ruled that long distance offerings in which calls begin and end on the ordinary public switched telephone network  but are transmitted in part through the use of ip  are telecommunications services  thereby rendering the services subject to all the regulatory obligations imposed on ordinary long distance services  including payment of access charges and contributions to the universal service funds  or usf 
in addition  the fcc preempted states from exercising entry and related economic regulation of interconnected voip services that require the use of broadband connections and specialized customer premises equipment and permit users to terminate calls to and receive calls from the public switched telephone network 
however  the fcc s ruling did not address specifically whether this form of voip is an information service or a telecommunications service  or what regulatory obligations  such as intercarrier compensation  should apply 
nevertheless  the fcc requires interconnected voip providers to contribute to the federal usf  offer e emergency calling capabilities to their subscribers  and comply with the electronic surveillance obligations set forth in the communications assistance for law enforcement act  or calea 
because we provide voip services and transport voip originated traffic  an fcc ruling on the regulatory classification of voip services and the applicability of specific intercarrier compensation 
table of contents rates is likely to affect the cost to provide these services  our pricing of these services  access to numbering resources needed to provide these services  and long term e  calea and usf obligations 
high speed internet access services following a june us supreme court decision affirming the fcc s classification of cable modem internet access service as an information service and declining to impose mandatory common carrier regulation on cable providers  the fcc issued an order in september declaring that the wireline high speed internet access services  which are provided by ilecs  are information services rather than telecommunications services 
as a result  over time ilecs have been relieved of certain obligations regarding the provision of the underlying broadband transmission services 
in  the fcc followed this decision with a similar deregulation of wireless high speed internet access services 
such deregulation should result in less regulation of some of our evolution data optimized  or ev do  products and services 
deregulation of broadband services  however  has sparked a debate over net neutrality and open access 
proponents of net neutrality assert that operators of broadband transmission facilities should not be permitted to make distinctions among content providers for priority access to the underlying facilities and that networks should be open to use by any device the customer chooses to bring to the network 
while we have announced our intention to open the wireless operating platform of our handsets through our participation with google in the open handset alliance  an open access or net neutrality mandate that is not narrowly crafted could adversely affect the operation of our broadband networks by constraining our ability to control the network and protect our users from harm caused by other users and devices 
additionally  the fcc has a pending proceeding to consider whether all high speed internet access services  regardless of the technology used  are subject to various fcc consumer protection regulations 
the imposition of any such obligations could result in significant costs to us 
other regulations truth in billing and consumer protection the fcc s truth in billing rules generally require both wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers  such as us  to provide full and fair disclosure of all charges on their bills  including brief  clear  and non misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided 
in response to a petition from the national association of state utility consumer advocates  the fcc found that state regulation of cmrs rates  including line items on consumer bills  is preempted by federal statute 
this decision was overturned by the th circuit court of appeals and the supreme court denied further appeal 
as a consequence  there may be an increase in state activities to impose various regulations on the billing practices of wireless carriers 
the fcc is continuing to look at issues of consumer protection  including the use of early termination fees  and the appropriate state and federal roles 
if states gain such authority  or there are other changes in the truth in billing rules  our billing and customer service costs could increase 
access charge reform ilec and competitive local exchange carriers  or clecs  impose access charges for the origination and termination of long distance calls upon wireless and long distance carriers  including our wireless and wireline segments 
also  interconnected local carriers  including our wireless segment  pay to each other reciprocal compensation fees for terminating interconnected local calls 
in addition  ilecs and clecs impose special access charges for their provision of dedicated facilities to other carriers  including both our wireless and wireline segments 
these fees and charges are a significant cost for our wireless and wireline segments 
there are ongoing proceedings at the fcc related to access charges and special access rates  which could impact our costs for these services  but these proceedings have been pending for some time and fcc action is not anticipated in the near future 

table of contents in the past year  several ilecs have sought and received forbearance from fcc regulation of certain enterprise broadband services 
specifically  the fcc granted forbearance to at t  acs anchorage  embarq  frontier and citizens from price regulation of their non time division multiplexing  or tdm based high capacity special access services 
furthermore  in  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia found that verizon was deemed granted forbearance from the same rules when the fcc deadlocked on its similar forbearance petition  and that the deemed grant was unreviewable by the court 
our request for en banc review was denied 
we have appealed the fcc s rulings with respect to at t  citizens  frontier and embarq 
these deregulatory actions by the fcc could enable the ilecs to raise their special access prices 
the fcc currently is considering measures to address traffic pumping by local exchange carriers  or lecs  predominantly in rural exchanges  that have very high access charges 
under traffic pumping arrangements  the lecs partner with other entities to offer free or almost free services such as conference calling and chat lines to end users  these services and payments to the lecs partners are financed through the assessment of high access charges on the end user s long distance or wireless carrier 
because of the peculiarities of the fcc s access rate rules for small rural carriers  these lecs are allowed to base their rates on low historic demand levels rather than the vastly higher pumped demand levels  which enables the lec to earn windfall profits 
the fcc is considering the legality of traffic pumping arrangements as well as rule changes to ensure that rates charged by lecs experiencing substantial increases in demand volumes are just and reasonable 
as a major wireless and wireline carrier  we have been assessed millions of dollars in access charges for pumped traffic 
adoption by the fcc of appropriate measures to limit the windfall profits associated with traffic pumping will have a direct beneficial impact on us 
also  we and other carriers have traffic pumping cases against several lecs and their traffic pumping partners pending in various us district courts and the iowa utilities board 
universal service reform communications carriers contribute into and receive support from the usf  established by the fcc and many states 
the federal usf program funds services provided in high cost areas  reduced rate services to low income consumers  and discounted communications and internet services for schools  libraries and rural health care facilities 
the usf is funded from assessments on communications providers  including our wireless and wireline segments  based on fcc prescribed contribution factors applicable to our interstate and international end user revenues from telecommunications services and interconnected voip services 
similarly  many states have established their own universal service funds into which we contribute 
the fcc is considering changing the interstate revenue based assessment with an assessment based on telephone numbers or connections to the public network  which could impact the amount of our assessments  but it is not clear that the fcc is prepared to take action in the near future 
as permitted  we assess subscribers for these usf charges 
the fcc also is considering changing the way it distributes federal usf support to competitive carriers like us 
currently  we receive support in jurisdictions as an eligible telecommunications carrier  or etc 
in  the fcc capped the total amount of high cost usf support competitive carriers could receive and has continued to impose conditions on parties seeking merger or acquisition approval to reduce their usf receipts 
as part of the clearwire transaction  we agreed to reduce our usf receipts to zero in five equal steps over a four year period 
the annual amount we currently receive from usf is immaterial 
in addition  various state commissions have imposed or are considering new billing  lifeline service and network deployment requirements which add significantly to the cost and burden of providing service as an etc 
a loss of our etc designation in a given state  whether voluntary or mandatory  would require us to forego our usf support in that state 
electronic surveillance obligations the calea requires telecommunications carriers  including us  to modify equipment  facilities and services to allow for authorized electronic surveillance based on either industry or fcc standards 
our calea obligations have been extended to data and voip networks  and we are in compliance with these requirements 
certain laws and regulations require that we assist various government agencies with electronic surveillance of communications and records concerning those communications 
we are a defendant in four purported class 
table of contents action lawsuits that allege that we participated in a program of intelligence gathering activities for the federal government following the terrorist attacks of september  that violated federal and state law 
relief sought in these cases includes injunctive relief  statutory and punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
we believe these suits have no merit 
we do not disclose customer information to the government or assist government agencies in electronic surveillance unless we have been provided a lawful request for such information 
privacy related regulations we comply with fcc customer proprietary network information  or cpni  rules  which require carriers to comply with a range of marketing and safeguard obligations 
these obligations focus on carriers access  use  storage and disclosure of cpni 
in  the fcc adopted a new cpni order that imposed additional cpni obligations on carriers 
the new cpni rules took effect in december we are utilizing a variety of compliance vehicles  such as technical and systematic solutions and updated policies and procedures  to conform our operations to the new cpni obligations 
the technical and systematic solutions offer significant data security benefits  but they also require significant development and testing 
we petitioned the fcc for a limited waiver of some new cpni rules so that we could complete development  testing and deployment of our cpni compliance solutions 
no opposition comments were filed in response to our petition 
we also continue to monitor our cpni compliance program and make enhancements and improvements when necessary 
environmental compliance our environmental compliance and remediation obligations relate primarily to the operation of standby power generators  batteries and fuel storage for our telecommunications equipment 
these obligations require compliance with storage and related standards  obtaining of permits and occasional remediation 
although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations  we do not believe that any such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have identified seven former manufactured gas plant sites in nebraska  not currently owned or operated by us  that may have been owned or operated by entities acquired by centel corporation  formerly a subsidiary of ours and now a subsidiary of embarq 
we and embarq have agreed to share the environmental liabilities arising from these former manufactured gas plant sites 
three of the sites are part of ongoing settlement negotiations and administrative consent orders with the environmental protection agency  or epa 
two of the sites have had initial site assessments conducted by the nebraska department of environmental quality  or ndeq  but no regulatory actions have followed 
the two remaining sites have had no regulatory action by the epa or the ndeq 
centel has entered into agreements with other potentially responsible parties to share costs in connection with five of the seven sites 
we are working to assess the scope and nature of these sites and our potential responsibility  which is not expected to be material 
patents  trademarks and licenses we own numerous patents  patent applications  service marks  trademarks and other intellectual property in the united states and other countries  including sprint  nextel  direct connect  and boost mobile 
our services often use the intellectual property of others  such as licensed software  and we often license copyrights  patents and trademarks of others 
in total  these licenses and our copyrights  patents  trademarks and service marks are of material importance to the business 
generally  our trademarks and service marks endure and are enforceable so long as they continue to be used 
our patents and licensed patents have remaining terms generally ranging from one to years 
we occasionally license our intellectual property to others  including licenses to others to use the trademarks sprint and nextel 

table of contents we have received claims in the past  and may in the future receive claims  that we  or third parties from whom we license or purchase goods or services  have infringed on the intellectual property of others 
these claims can be time consuming and costly to defend  and divert management resources 
if these claims are successful  we could be forced to pay significant damages or stop selling certain products or services or stop using certain trademarks 
we  or third parties from whom we license or purchase goods or services  also could enter into licenses with unfavorable terms  including royalty payments  which could adversely affect our business 
employee relations as of december   we had about  employees 
in january  we announced a cost reduction program designed to further align our cost structure with the reduced revenues expected from fewer subscribers 
our cost reduction program is designed to reduce our labor and other costs through a workforce reduction of about  positions

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us 
our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
if we are not able to attract and retain wireless subscribers  our financial performance will be impaired 
we are in the business of selling communications services to subscribers  and our economic success is based on our ability to attract new subscribers and retain current subscribers 
if we are unable to find enough people willing to subscribe for or purchase our wireless communications services  or unwilling to continue to purchase our services  at the prices at which we are willing to sell them  our financial performance will be impaired  and we could fail to meet our financial obligations  which could result in several outcomes  including controlling investments by third parties  takeover bids  liquidation of assets or insolvency 
since january   we have experienced a million decrease in our total direct subscriber base  including approximately million post paid subscribers 
in addition  over the past year  we have experienced an average post paid churn rate of  while our two largest competitors had churn rates that were substantially lower 
our ability to compete successfully for new subscribers and to retain our existing subscribers and reduce our rate of churn depends on our successful execution of marketing and sales strategies  including the acceptance of our value proposition  service delivery and customer care activities  including new account set up and billing  and our credit and collection policies  our ability to enter into arrangements with mvnos and alternative resellers  our ability to anticipate and develop new or enhanced products and services that are attractive to existing or potential subscribers  our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced by our competitors  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions  and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors  actual or perceived quality and coverage of our network  and public perception about our brand 
our recent efforts to attract new subscribers and reduce churn have not been as successful as those of our competitors 
our subscriber losses and high rate of churn have impaired our ability to maintain the level of revenues generated in prior periods and caused deterioration in the operating margins of our wireless operations and our operations as a whole  the effects of which will continue if we do not attract new subscribers and reduce our rate of churn 
our ability to retain subscribers may also be negatively affected by industry trends related to subscriber contracts 
for example  we and our competitors no longer require subscribers to renew their contracts when making changes to their pricing plans 
these types of changes could negatively affect our ability to retain subscribers and could lead to an increase in our churn rates if we are not successful in providing an attractive product and service mix 
we expect to incur expenses to attract new subscribers  improve subscriber retention and reduce churn  but there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in new subscribers or a lower rate of subscriber churn 
subscriber losses and a high rate of churn adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations because they result in lost revenues and cash flow 
although attracting new subscribers and retention of existing subscribers are important to the financial viability of our business  there is an added focus on retention 
table of contents because the cost of adding a new subscriber is higher than the cost associated with retention of an existing subscriber  and new subscribers are generally entering into contracts with lower average revenue per subscriber than the subscribers leaving our network 
as the wireless market matures  we must increasingly seek to attract subscribers from competitors and face increased credit risk from first time wireless subscribers 
we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other s existing subscriber bases rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
recently  we have not been able to attract subscribers at the same rate as our competitors and have had a net loss of subscribers during and in addition  the higher market penetration also means that subscribers purchasing wireless services for the first time  on average  have a lower credit rating than existing wireless users  and the number of these subscribers we are willing to accept is dependent on our credit policies  which change from time to time 
to the extent we cannot compete effectively for new subscribers  our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected 
competition and technological changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our average revenue per subscriber  subscriber churn  operating costs and our ability to attract new subscribers  resulting in adverse effects on our revenues  future cash flows  growth and profitability 
we compete with a number of other wireless service providers in each of the markets in which we provide wireless services  and we expect competition to increase as additional spectrum is made available for commercial wireless services and as new technologies are developed and launched 
as competition among wireless communications providers has increased  we have created pricing plans that have resulted in declining average revenue per subscriber  for voice and data services  a trend that we expect will continue 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact subscriber retention and our ability to attract new subscribers  with adverse effects on our results of operations 
a decline in the average revenue per subscriber coupled with our declining number of subscribers will negatively impact our revenues  future cash flows  growth and overall profitability  which  in turn  could impact our ability to meet our financial obligations 
the wireless communications industry is experiencing significant technological change  including improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology and the deployment of unlicensed spectrum devices 
this change causes uncertainty about future subscriber demand for our wireless services and the prices that we will be able to charge for these services 
in addition  due  in part  to current economic conditions  we are carefully monitoring our spending  and we are targeting how and where we spend our capital on network and service enhancements 
spending by our competitors on new wireless services and network improvements could enable our competitors to obtain a competitive advantage with new technologies or enhancements that we do not offer 
rapid change in technology may lead to the development of wireless communications technologies or alternative services that are superior to our technologies or services or that consumers prefer over ours 
if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis  or at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose subscribers to our competitors 
mergers or other business combinations involving our competitors and new entrants  including new wholesale relationships  beginning to offer wireless services may also continue to increase competition 
these wireless operators may be able to offer subscribers network features or products and services not offered by us  coverage in areas not served by either of our wireless networks or pricing plans that are lower than those offered by us  all of which would negatively affect our average revenue per subscriber  subscriber churn  ability to attract new subscribers  and operating costs 
for example  at t  verizon and t mobile now offer competitive wireless services packaged with local and long distance voice and high speed internet services  and flat rate voice and data plans 
our boost mobile branded services compete with several regional carriers  including metro pcs and leap wireless  which offer competitively priced calling plans that include unlimited local calling 
in addition  we may lose subscribers of our higher priced plans to our boost mobile offerings 

table of contents one of the primary differentiating features of our nextel branded service is the two way walkie talkie service available on our iden network 
several wireless equipment vendors  including motorola  which supplies equipment for our nextel branded service  have begun to offer wireless equipment that is capable of providing walkie talkie services that are designed to compete with our walkie talkie services 
several of our competitors have introduced handsets that are capable of providing walkie talkie services 
if these competitors services are perceived to be or become comparable  or if any services introduced in the future are comparable to our nextel branded walkie talkie services  a key competitive advantage of our nextel service would be reduced  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
failure to improve wireless subscriber service and failure to continue to enhance the quality and features of our wireless networks and meet capacity requirements of our subscriber base could impair our financial performance and adversely affect our results of operations 
although we must continually make investments and incur costs in order to improve our wireless subscriber service and remain competitive  due to  among other things  the current economic conditions  we are carefully targeting how and where we spend our capital on network and service enhancements 
over the past few years  we worked to enhance the quality of our wireless networks and related services by maintaining and expanding the capacity and coverage of our networks  securing sufficient transmitter and receiver sites and obtaining zoning and construction approvals or permits at appropriate locations  obtaining adequate quantities of system infrastructure equipment and handsets  and related accessories to meet subscriber demand  and obtaining additional spectrum in some or all of our markets  if and when necessary 
our current budget and focus on careful spending will require us to make decisions on the necessity and timing of certain network enhancements 
we may not continue to update our network at the same rate as in previous years 
with our recent improvements and given our reduced number of subscribers  we do not believe this reduced spending will adversely affect the quality of our networks 
if our competitors spend on their network and service enhancements while we are curtailing our nonessential spending  their networks could perform at levels superior to ours  which could negatively affect our ability to attract new subscribers or retain existing subscribers 
any network and service enhancements we decide to make may not occur as scheduled or at the cost that we have estimated 
delays or failure to add network capacity  failure to maintain roaming agreements or increased costs of adding capacity could limit our ability to satisfy our wireless subscribers  resulting in decreased revenues 
even if we continuously upgrade our wireless networks  there can be no assurance that existing subscribers will not prefer features of our competitors and switch wireless providers 
current economic conditions  our recent financial performance and our debt ratings could negatively impact our access to the capital markets resulting in less growth than planned or failure to satisfy financial covenants under our existing debt agreements 
although we do not believe we will require additional capital to make the capital and operating expenditures necessary to implement our business plans or to satisfy our debt service requirements for the next few years  we may need to incur additional debt in the future for a variety of reasons  including future acquisitions 
our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on  among other factors  our financial performance  debt ratings  general economic conditions and prevailing market conditions 
some of these factors are beyond our control 
due to current economic conditions  our financial performance and our debt ratings  we may not be able to arrange additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
failure to obtain suitable financing when needed 
table of contents could  among other things  result in our inability to continue to expand our businesses and meet competitive challenges 
our debt ratings could be downgraded if we incur significant additional indebtedness  or if we do not generate sufficient cash from our operations  which would likely increase our future borrowing costs and could affect our ability to access capital 
our credit facilities require that we maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other non cash gains or losses  such as goodwill impairment charges  of no more than to  which as of december   was to if we do not continue to satisfy this ratio  we will be in default under our credit facilities  which could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations  which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile  notwithstanding our actual operations and performance 
the stock market in general  and the market for communications and technology companies in particular  have experienced price and volume fluctuations over the past year 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operations and performance 
the trading price of our common stock has fallen by since january  stock price volatility and continued and sustained decreases in our share price could subject our shareholders to losses and us to takeover bids or lead to action by the nyse 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to fluctuations in price in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including  but not limited to quarterly announcements and variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  either alone or in comparison to analysts expectations  including announcements on our subscriber activity and rate of churn  the availability or perceived availability of additional capital and market perceptions relating to our access to this capital  seasonality or other variations in our subscriber base  including our rate of churn  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions  new products  significant contracts  commercial relationships or capital commitments  the performance of clearwire and clearwire s class a common stock or speculation about the possibility of future actions we or other significant shareholders may take in connection with clearwire holdings  disruption to our operations or those of other companies critical to our network operations  announcements by us regarding the entering into  or termination of  material transactions  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis  recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates concerning us  the incurrence of additional debt  dilutive issuances of our stock  short sales  hedging and other derivative transactions of our common stock  any major change in our board of directors or management  litigation  changes in governmental regulations or approvals  and perceptions of general market conditions in the technology and communications industries  the us economy and global market conditions 

table of contents consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services  as well as consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers used for wireless services  could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our wireline segment competes with at t  verizon  qwest communications  level communications inc  other major local incumbent operating companies  and cable operators  as well as a host of smaller competitors  in the provision of wireline services 
some of these companies have high capacity  ip based fiber optic networks capable of supporting large amounts of voice and data traffic 
some of these companies claim certain cost structure advantages that  among other factors  may allow them to offer services at a price below that which we can offer profitably 
in addition  consolidation by these companies could lead to fewer companies controlling access to more cell sites  enabling them to control usage and rates  which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
increased competition and the significant increase in capacity resulting from new technologies and networks may drive already low prices down further 
at t and verizon  as a result of their acquisitions  continue to be our two largest competitors in the domestic long distance communications market 
we and other long distance carriers depend heavily on local access facilities obtained from ilecs to serve our long distance subscribers  and payments to ilecs for these facilities are a significant cost of service for our wireline segment 
the long distance operations of at t and verizon have cost and operational advantages with respect to these access facilities because those carriers serve significant geographic areas  including many large urban areas  as the incumbent local carrier 
in addition  our wireless segment could be adversely affected by changes in rates and access fees that result from consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers  which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
failure to complete development  testing and deployment of new technology that supports new services could affect our ability to compete in the industry 
the deployment of new technology and new service offerings could result in network degradation or the loss of subscribers 
in addition  the technology we use may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we develop  test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services 
successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend  in part  on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications in a timely manner 
we may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner  and they may not be widely accepted by our subscribers or may not be profitable  in which case we could not recover our investment in the technology 
deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services and may require us to take action like curtailing new subscribers in certain markets 
any resulting subscriber dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain subscribers and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth prospects 
our wireless networks provide services utilizing cdma and iden technologies 
wireless subscribers served by these two technologies represent a smaller portion of global wireless subscribers than the subscribers served by wireless networks that utilize gsm technology 
as a result  our costs with respect to both cdma and iden network equipment and handsets may continue to be higher than the comparable costs incurred by our competitors who use gsm technology  which places us at a competitive disadvantage 
we recently entered into agreements with clearwire to integrate our wimax wireless broadband business with theirs 
see risks related to our investment in clearwire below for risks related to the deployment of wimax 

table of contents the blurring of the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services contribute to increased competition 
the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers  joint ventures and various service expansion strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated services in many of the markets we serve 
this trend is also reflected in changes in the regulatory environment that have encouraged competition and the offering of integrated services 
we expect competition to intensify across all of our business segments as a result of the entrance of new competitors or the expansion of services offered by existing competitors  and the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products  or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures we will be required to make in order to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in the competitive environment affecting our industry  we could lose market share or experience a decline in revenue  cash flows and net income 
as a result of the financial strength and benefits of scale enjoyed by some of our competitors  they may be able to offer services at lower prices than we can  thereby adversely affecting our revenues  growth and profitability 
if we are unable to improve our results of operations  we face the possibility of additional charges for impairments of long lived or indefinite lived assets 
in addition  if the fair market value of our investment in clearwire continues to trade below its book value  it could result in an impairment charge 
also  our future operating results will be impacted by our share of clearwire s net loss or net income  which during this period of their network build out will likely negatively affect our results of operations 
we review our wireless and wireline long lived assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the book amount may not be recoverable 
if we are unable to improve our results of operations and cash flows  a review could lead to a material impairment charge in our consolidated financial statements 
we account for our investment in clearwire using the equity method of accounting and  as a result  we record our share of clearwire s net income or net loss which could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the trading price of clearwire s class a common stock has been and may continue to be volatile  and the fair market value of our investment may continue to be below the book value of the investment  which could result in a material impairment charge in our consolidated financial statements 
if motorola is unable or unwilling to provide us with equipment and handsets in support of our iden based services  as well as anticipated handset and infrastructure improvements for those services  our operations will be adversely affected 
motorola is our sole source for most of the equipment that supports the iden network and for all of the handsets we offer under the nextel brand except for blackberry devices 
although our handset supply agreement with motorola is structured to provide competitively priced handsets  the cost of iden handsets is generally higher than handsets that do not incorporate a similar multi function capability 
this difference may make it more difficult or costly for us to offer handsets at prices that are attractive to potential subscribers 
in addition  the higher cost of iden handsets requires us to absorb a larger part of the cost of offering handsets to new and existing subscribers 
these increased costs and handset subsidy expenses may reduce our growth and profitability 
also  we must rely on motorola to develop handsets and equipment capable of supporting the features and services we offer to subscribers of services on our iden network  including the dual mode handsets 
a decision by motorola to discontinue  or the inability of motorola to continue  manufacturing  supporting or enhancing our iden based infrastructure and handsets would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  because iden technology is not as widely adopted and has fewer subscribers than other wireless technologies  it is less likely that manufacturers other than motorola will be willing to make the significant financial commitment 
table of contents required to license  develop and manufacture iden infrastructure equipment and handsets 
further  our ability to complete the spectrum reconfiguration plan in connection with the fcc s report and order is dependent  in part  on motorola 
we have entered into agreements with third parties related to certain business operations 
any difficulties experienced in these arrangements could result in additional expense  loss of subscribers and revenue  interruption of our services or a delay in the roll out of new technology 
we have entered into agreements with third parties for the development and maintenance of certain software systems necessary for the operation of our business 
we also have agreements with third parties to provide customer service and related support to our wireless subscribers and outsourced aspects of our wireline network and back office functions to third parties 
in addition  we have sublease agreements with third parties for space on communications towers 
as a result  we must rely on third parties to perform certain of our operations and  in certain circumstances  interface with our subscribers 
if these third parties are unable to perform to our requirements  we would have to pursue alternative strategies to provide these services and that could result in delays  interruptions  additional expenses and loss of subscribers 
we are subject to exclusivity provisions and other restrictions under our arrangements with our remaining independent pcs affiliates 
continued compliance with those restrictions may limit our ability to fully integrate the operations of nextel and nextel partners in the geographic areas served by those pcs affiliates  may impact our ability to offer certain types of wireless products and services  and we could incur significant costs to resolve issues related to these arrangements 
our agreements with our remaining independent pcs affiliates restrict our and their ability to own  operate  build or manage specified wireless communication networks or to sell certain wireless services within specified geographic areas 
these agreements could negatively affect our ability to introduce new products and services on a nationwide basis and the growth of our network 
in addition  as a result of litigation with one pcs affiliate  we were ordered to cease owning  operating or managing our nextel network in parts of illinois  indiana  iowa  michigan  missouri  nebraska and wisconsin 
the illinois supreme court affirmed the trial court decision in november  but provided us with days to sell or otherwise cease the operation or management of our nextel network in the relevant geographic areas 
compliance with this order could cause disruption to our service  result in subscriber losses and negatively affect our results of operations 
the trial court denied our request to set aside this judgment based on new evidence and we plan to appeal that denial 
the outcome of the ongoing litigation with that pcs affiliate  which is uncertain  may impact our ability to offer certain types of wireless products and services on a nationwide basis  and we could incur significant costs to litigate and resolve this issue 
the intellectual property rights utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others 
some of our products and services use intellectual property that we own 
we also purchase products from suppliers  including handset device suppliers  and outsource services to service providers  including billing and customer care functions  that incorporate or utilize intellectual property 
we and some of our suppliers and service providers have received  and may receive in the future  assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties 
these claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services 
these claims and assertions also could subject us to costly litigation and significant liabilities for damages or royalty payments  or require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling certain products and services 
our cdma handsets use products obtained from qualcomm 
some of qualcomm s products have been found to infringe on certain patents owned by broadcom corporation 
a united states district court enjoined qualcomm from further infringement and allowed for a sunset provision that expired on january  
table of contents qualcomm has supplied us with alternative technologies 
broadcom may continue to challenge the alternatives  and broadcom has initiated other suits against qualcomm 
these claims could subject us to costly litigation  a court could determine that the alternative technologies still infringe broadcom s patents  and or a court could require us to cease providing certain qualcomm products 
government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects  future growth or results of operations 
the fcc and other federal  state and local governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business and could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
the licensing  construction  operation  sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the fcc and  depending on the jurisdiction  state and local regulatory agencies 
in particular  the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees  the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered  and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands 
the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation 
there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed 
failure to comply with fcc requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area 
depending on their outcome  the fcc s proceedings regarding regulation of special access rates could affect the rates paid by our wireless and wireline segments for special access services in the future 
similarly  depending on their outcome  the fcc s proceedings on the regulatory classification of voip services could affect the intercarrier compensation rates and the level of usf contributions paid by us 
in  the fcc adopted a report and order to reconfigure the mhz band that provides for the exchange of a portion of our mhz fcc spectrum licenses and requires us to fund the cost incurred by public safety systems and other incumbent licensees to reconfigure 
in order to accomplish the reconfiguration  we may need to cease our use of a portion of the mhz spectrum on our iden network in a particular market before we are able to begin use of replacement mhz spectrum in that market 
to mitigate the temporary loss of the use of this spectrum  we may need to construct additional transmitter and receiver sites or acquire additional spectrum 
in markets where we are unable to construct additional sites or acquire additional spectrum as needed  the decrease in capacity may adversely affect the performance of our iden network 
various states are considering regulations over terms and conditions of service  including certain billing practices and consumer related issues that may not be pre empted by federal law 
if imposed  these regulations could make it more difficult and expensive to implement national sales and marketing programs and could increase the costs of our wireless operations 
degradation in network performance caused by compliance with government regulation  loss of spectrum or additional rules associated with the use of spectrum in any market could result in an inability to attract new subscribers or higher subscriber churn in that market  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  additional costs or fees imposed by governmental regulation could adversely affect our revenues  future growth and results of operations 

table of contents the current economic environment may make it difficult for our business partners and subscribers to meet their contractual obligations  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
the current economic environment has made it difficult for businesses and consumers to obtain credit  which could cause our suppliers  distributors and subscribers to have problems meeting their contractual obligations with us 
if our suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders or meet their contractual obligations with us  we may not have the services or handsets available to meet the needs of our current and future subscribers  which could cause us to lose current and potential subscribers to other carriers 
in addition  if our distributors are unable to stay in business  we could lose distribution points  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
finally  if our subscribers are unable to pay their bills or potential subscribers feel they are unable to take on additional financial obligations  they may be forced to forgo our services  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
our business could be negatively impacted by security threats and other disruptions 
major equipment failures  natural disasters  including severe weather  terrorist acts  cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security that affect our wireline and wireless networks  including transport facilities  communications switches  routers  microwave links  cell sites or other equipment or third party owned local and long distance networks on which we rely  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these events could disrupt our operations  require significant resources  result in a loss of subscribers or impair our ability to attract new subscribers  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our services 
portable communications devices have been alleged to pose health risks  including cancer  due to radio frequency emissions from these devices 
purported class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against numerous wireless carriers  including us  seeking not only damages but also remedies that could increase our cost of doing business 
we cannot be sure of the outcome of those cases or that our business and financial condition will not be adversely affected by litigation of this nature or public perception about health risks 
the actual or perceived risk of mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers  reduced network usage per subscriber or reduced financing available to the mobile communications industry 
further research and studies are ongoing  and we cannot be sure that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns

item legal proceedings in september  the us district court for the district of kansas denied a motion to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit alleging that our and proxy statements were false and misleading in violation of federal securities laws to the extent they described new employment agreements with certain senior executives without disclosing that  according to the allegations  replacement of those executives was inevitable 
these allegations  made in an amended complaint in a lawsuit originally filed in  are asserted against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors  and seek to recover any decline in the value of our tracking stocks during the class period 
the parties have stipulated that the case can proceed as a class action 
all defendants have denied plaintiffs allegations and intend to defend this matter vigorously 
allegations in the original complaint  which asserted claims against the same defendants and our former independent auditor  were dismissed by the court in april our motion to dismiss the amended complaint was denied  and the parties are engaged in discovery 
a number of cases that allege sprint communications company lp failed to obtain easements from property owners during the installation of its fiber optic network in the s have been filed in various courts 
several of these cases sought certification of nationwide classes  and in one case  a nationwide class was certified 
in  a nationwide settlement of these claims was approved by the us district court for the northern district of illinois  but objectors appealed the preliminary approval order to the seventh circuit court of appeals  which overturned the settlement and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings 
the parties proceeded with litigation and or settlement negotiations on a state by state basis  and settlement negotiations have been coordinated in all cases but those pending in louisiana and tennessee 
the louisiana claims have been separately settled for an amount not material to the company  and that settlement was given final approval by the court  and the time to appeal that approval has expired 
we have reached an agreement in principle to settle the claims in all the other states  excluding tennessee  for an amount not material to us 
the court issued its preliminary approval of the settlement on july   and the court is in the process of considering objections to the settlement 

table of contents in connection with the sprint nextel merger in  we disclosed that several pcs affiliates had filed lawsuits in various courts  alleging that the sprint nextel merger would result in breaches of exclusivity provisions in their commercial affiliation agreements with our subsidiaries 
with the exception of ipcs wireless  inc  or ipcs  all such suits have been disposed of 
on september   the illinois supreme court denied our petition for appeal in a contract dispute with ipcs 
as a result  the illinois circuit court decision from august holding that sprint s merger with nextel breached sprint s agreement with ipcs was upheld 
the judge in that case entered an order requiring sprint to cease owning  operating or managing the iden network in parts of certain midwestern states illinois  iowa  michigan  missouri  nebraska  wisconsin and a small portion of indiana that make up the ipcs territory 
on october   we filed a motion asking the illinois supreme court to reconsider its decision not to hear the appeal  on grounds that the circuit court decision infringed upon the fcc s authority to determine the ownership and use of telecommunications licenses  and on grounds that the injunction entered by the circuit court violates illinois public policy 
the illinois supreme court declined to hear the appeal but increased the time for compliance with the order to days  which began to run on january  we have also filed a motion asking the circuit court to reconsider its decision in light of newly discovered evidence that was not produced by ipcs in the earlier circuit court proceeding 
the circuit court denied that motion  and we have appealed that denial 
we continue to believe the circuit court injunction is erroneous and contrary to public policy  and will continue to oppose it vigorously 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to challenge the injunction  we may have to depreciate our iden assets in the ipcs markets on an accelerated basis and or pursue other strategic alternatives 
various other suits  proceedings and claims  including purported class actions  typical for a large business enterprise  are pending against us or our subsidiaries 
while it is not possible to determine the ultimate disposition of each of these proceedings and whether they will be resolved consistent with our beliefs  we expect that the outcome of such proceedings  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation

overview we are a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers  businesses and government subscribers 
the communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price  the types of services and devices offered and the quality of service 
we have accordingly organized our operations to meet the needs of our targeted customer groups through focused communications solutions that incorporate the capabilities of our wireless and wireline services 
we are one of the three largest wireless companies in the united states based on the number of wireless subscribers 
we also are one of the largest providers of wireline long distance services and one of the largest carriers of internet traffic in the nation 
we own extensive wireless networks and a global long distance  tier internet backbone 
our business includes two reportable segments wireless and wireline 
see the information discussed in item and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segments 
in addition  we also routinely post important information on our website at www 
sprint 
com 
information contained on our website is not part of this annual report 
we offer wireless services and wireline voice and data transmission services on state of the art networks that utilize cdma  iden and ip technologies 
we utilize these networks to offer our wireless and wireline customers differentiated products and services whether through the use of a single network or a combination of these networks 
in addition  we have established key priorities for our wireless business which include improving the customer experience  rebuilding our brand and increasing profitability 
we plan to achieve these priorities by providing customers with value and simplicity and by helping them to be more productive 
we believe that our value driven price plans are very attractive 
our family of simply everything post paid price plans bundle together popular data applications with traditional mobile voice calling at price points that can save customers hundreds of dollars annually compared with our largest competitors 
our boost mobile brand prepaid price plans include unique nationwide monthly unlimited  pay as you go  and per day chat plan options 

table of contents to simplify the customer experience  we have introduced tools such as one click that allows customers to access various software applications through a single click on their mobile devices 
our ready now program trains our subscribers before they leave the store in how to use their mobile devices to ensure subscribers are well informed and comfortable with the features and functions of their new devices 
we provide certain wireless services on the nation s most dependable g network and  in baltimore  subscribers may access clearwire s high speed g network 
in addition  we support the open development of applications and content on our network platforms 
we offer multi functional devices such as the samsung instinct and the iden blackberry curve 
through wholesale relationships  we support traditional wireless services as well as the wireless delivery of books and other data centric content that substitute for more traditional deliveries of products and services 
in addition to our customer oriented goals  we have also taken measures to reduce our cost structure to further align with the reduced revenues expected from fewer subscribers 
our actions include our january workforce reduction announcement through which we plan to reduce our labor and related costs by approximately billion through actions that include a workforce reduction of about  positions 
we believe these actions  as well as our continued efforts to reduce our other operating expenses  will allow us to maintain a strong cash position  although we do not expect that these measures will offset the reduced cash expected from our service revenue declines in the near term 
our cost reduction initiatives may also include de levering and disposing of assets in the future 
we believe that given the recent deterioration in the us economy coupled with short term illiquidity  consumer and business spending will be negatively impacted 
we will continue to monitor the impact of these market conditions on our ability to collect from our subscribers and on other areas of our business 
we are subject to substantial regulation including from the fcc  which regulates the licensing  operation  acquisition and sale of the licensed radio spectrum that is essential to our business 
the fcc and state public utility commissions  or pucs  also regulate  in whole or part  the provision of communications services 
future changes in regulations or legislation related to spectrum licensing or other matters related to our business could impose significant additional costs either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations 
refer to item business legislative and regulatory development regulation and wireless operations for additional information 
wireless service revenue our wireless segment generates revenues from the provision of wireless services  the sale of wireless equipment and the provision of wholesale and other services 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of the number of subscribers that we serve  which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers  and the revenue generated from each subscriber  which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates that we charge for those services 
the declines in our subscriber base and revenue generated from each subscriber group discussed below have resulted in a decline in service revenue 
wireless subscribers the wireless industry is subject to intense competition to acquire and retain subscribers of wireless services 
most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services 
wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers 
as a result  wireless carriers have focused on retaining valued subscribers through various means including considerable efforts regarding customer care 

table of contents we have endeavored to retain and attract subscribers by taking actions to improve our customer care  sales and distribution functions  and brand awareness 
in addition  we took other actions in an effort to improve our subscribers experience including improving our network performance by adding cell sites to expand the coverage and capacity of our networks  broadening our handset portfolio  and providing subscribers an excellent value proposition with our simply everything pricing plans 
while certain indicators suggest that we are making progress with respect to these actions  we have continued to lose wireless subscribers 
post paid subscribers we lost approximately million net post paid subscribers during as compared to losing million net post paid subscribers in in  after considering subscribers transferring from our iden network to our cdma network  approximately million of our net post paid subscriber losses came from subscribers on the iden network as compared to  net subscriber losses on the cdma network 
in  approximately million of our net post paid subscriber losses came from subscribers on our iden network as compared to million net post paid subscriber additions on the cdma network 
our net subscriber losses have principally been caused by our attracting fewer new subscribers on both networks in recent periods as compared to the number of subscriber deactivations we have experienced 
we believe this reduction in new subscribers is primarily due to the market penetration rates described above compounded by the relative success that certain of our competitors are enjoying with respect to retaining subscribers 
we further believe this reduction in new subscribers is due to measures taken by us to increase the credit quality of our subscribers  as well as lingering consumer perceptions regarding our networks  particularly our iden network  and customer care 
our reduced iden oriented marketing programs and limited new handset offerings at higher than market prices have also contributed to the decline in new iden subscribers 
our post paid subscriber retention rates or rates of customer churn remain high relative to our larger competitors  however  our post paid subscriber churn rates have remained relatively flat in as compared to and  as we have experienced improvement in involuntary deactivations  due to our improving the credit quality of our subscriber base  offset by relatively high voluntary subscriber deactivations 
prepaid subscribers we lost approximately  net prepaid subscribers during as compared to adding  net prepaid subscribers in the subscriber losses included approximately million net subscribers on our iden network which was partially offset by  net subscriber additions on our cdma network 
in  we had  and  net prepaid subscriber additions on our iden and cdma networks  respectively 
our net prepaid subscriber losses in were principally caused by our attracting fewer new subscribers on the iden network and total deactivations increasing year over year 
we believe the net losses sustained are primarily due to our decision to focus our resources on our post paid business and increased competition from prepaid competitors 
refer to results of operations segment results of operations wireless wireless segment earnings below for a discussion of churn trends 
wholesale and affiliate subscribers wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that we serve on our networks through companies that resell our services to their subscribers 
in  wholesale subscriber additions were  resulting in about million wholesale subscribers at december   compared to about million wholesale subscribers at december  and million wholesale subscribers at december  certain wholesale devices are activated on the network by our wholesale partners prior to selling the device to the end user customer 
as of december   these subscribers  for which devices are not in the hands of an end user customer  represented approximately of the total wholesale subscriber base 

table of contents below is a table showing a net additions losses for the past twelve quarters of direct subscribers for our iden and cdma networks  excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations  existing subscribers who have migrated between networks and indirect subscribers of mvnos and pcs affiliates  b our total iden and cdma post paid subscribers as of each of the quarters in  and  and c our average rates of monthly post paid and prepaid customer churn for the past twelve quarters

to effect this change  the subscriber base as of october  was increased by  subscribers 
we adjusted our subscriber beginning balance so as to not increase our direct net subscriber additions or decrease the customer churn rates for the fourth quarter due to this policy change 
includes subscribers with powersource devices  which operate seamlessly between our cdma and iden networks  introduced in the fourth quarter we calculate churn by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter 
for accounts comprised of multiple subscribers  such as family plans and enterprise accounts  net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within days 
post paid churn consists of both voluntary churn  where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer  and involuntary churn  where we terminate the customer s service due to a lack of payment or other reasons 
during the third quarter  we implemented an additional churn rule to remove the impact of activations and deactivations occurring within days in the same account 
the new rule  which we believe presents a more precise churn calculation  reduced churn by basis points to in the third quarter the additional churn rule did not impact reported net additions or results of operations 
prior period churn figures have not been adjusted for this additional churn rule 

table of contents wireless subscriber expectations we are committed to both adding new subscribers and retaining existing subscribers in order to reverse the negative subscriber trends that we have experienced in recent years 
we expect to improve our subscriber results by consistently improving the customer experience by focusing on value  simplicity and productivity 
we expect that both post paid and total subscriber losses will improve in as compared to we believe this improvement will principally be driven by strengthening our brand through improving the customer experience as well as by the launch of our monthly prepaid nationwide unlimited plan on our iden network 
our net subscriber losses during the past two years have significantly reduced our revenue  operating margin and cash flow 
these effects will continue if we do not attract new subscribers and or reduce our rate of churn 
see forward looking statements and results of operations segment results of operations wireless wireless segment earnings below for a discussion of how our subscriber trends will impact our segment earnings trends

changes in average monthly post paid service revenue reflect subscribers who change rate plans  the level of voice and data usage during a quarter  the amount of service credits which we offer our subscribers  plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers 
average monthly post paid service revenue per subscriber was flat throughout as we improved the retention of our higher revenue subscribers and lessened the impact of rate plan migrations 
these improvements have been offset by the decline in average monthly post paid service revenue per iden subscriber 
our retention efforts have been focused on improving the customer experience  including  but not limited to  new simply everything bundled plans that provide unlimited voice  data  text and direct connect services  improved service levels from our customer care centers  and the new ready now program 
the decline in average monthly post paid service revenue per subscriber from and is primarily due to the loss of iden subscribers with higher priced service plans and the migration of iden subscribers to lower priced plans 
our average monthly service revenue in these periods also declined due to other reasons  the most significant of which is the number of service credits accepted by our subscribers on both networks  which increased due to our retention efforts 
average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber increased during the first  second and third quarters of due to higher access charges received from our boost unlimited users combined with more stable average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users 
average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber declined in the fourth quarter due to a decline in average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users 
there is no assurance that average monthly service revenue per post paid and prepaid subscribers will continue at these rates in the future 
segment earnings wireless segment earnings is primarily a function of wireless service revenue  costs to acquire subscribers  network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other wireless segment operating expenses 
the costs to acquire our subscribers include the net cost at which we sell our handsets  referred to as handset subsidies  as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers 
network costs primarily 
table of contents represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers 
the remaining costs associated with operating the wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization  back office support and bad debt expense 
wireless service revenue  costs to acquire subscribers  and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the growth in our subscriber base  but certain elements are fixed 
wireline through our wireline segment  we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services to our wireless segment  other communications companies and targeted business customers 
these services include domestic and international data communications using various protocols  such as mpls technologies  ip  asynchronous transfer mode  or atm  frame relay  managed network services and voice services 
our ip services can also be combined with our wireless services 
in addition  we provide ip and other services to cable msos that resell our local and long distance service and or use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities primarily to residential end user customers 
we are one of the nation s largest providers of long distance services and operate all digital long distance and tier ip networks 
for several years  our long distance voice services have experienced an industry wide trend of lower revenue from lower prices and competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies  as well as cable msos and internet service providers 
growth in voice services provided by cable msos is accelerating as consumers use cable msos as alternatives to local and long distance voice communications providers 
we continue to assess the portfolio of services provided by our wireline segment and are focusing our efforts on ip based services and de emphasizing stand alone voice services and non ip based data services 
for example  in addition to increased emphasis on selling ip and managed services  we are converting most of our existing subscribers from atm and frame relay to more advanced ip technologies  such as mpls  sprintlink frame relay and sprintlink atm  which will reduce our cost structure by moving toward one consolidated data platform that can provide converged services 
over time  this conversion is expected to result in decreases in revenue from frame relay and atm service offset by increases in ip and mpls services 
we also are taking advantage of the growth in voice services provided by cable msos  by providing large cable msos with wholesale voice local and long distance services  which they offer as part of their bundled service offerings  as well as traditional voice and data services for their enterprise use 
results of operations we present consolidated information as well as separate supplemental financial information for our two reportable segments wireless and wireline 
the disaggregated financial results for our two reportable segments have been prepared in a manner that is consistent with the basis and manner in which our chief executive officer evaluates segment performance and makes resource allocation decisions 
consequently  segment earnings is defined as wireless or wireline operating income loss before other segment expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  severance  exit costs  goodwill and asset impairments  other and merger and integration expenses solely and directly attributable to the segment 
expenses and income items excluded from segment earnings are managed at the corporate level 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segments 
for reconciliations of segment earnings to operating income  the closest generally accepted accounting principles measure  see the tables set forth in wireless and wireline below

a summary of changes in net additions to subscribers and average monthly service revenue per subscriber since the first quarter may be found on pages and service revenues decreased billion  or  in as compared to over half of the decline is due to a decrease in the average number of direct post paid subscribers  and the remaining amount is due to a decline in average monthly service revenue per post paid user 
as previously discussed in overview wireless service revenue wireless subscribers  our net post paid subscriber losses have principally been caused by our attracting fewer new subscribers on both the iden and cdma networks in recent periods 
see subscriber trends discussed in wireless segment earnings below for expected impact on future periods 
over half of the decline in average monthly service revenue per post paid subscriber in  as compared to  is due to the loss of iden subscribers with higher priced service plans and the migration of iden subscribers to lower priced plans 
our average monthly service revenue also declined due to other reasons  the most significant of which is the number of service credits accepted by our subscribers on both networks  which increased due to our retention efforts 
see discussion of service revenue in wireless segment earnings below 
service revenues decreased million  or less than  in as compared to  due to a decrease of approximately million in service revenue from our direct post paid subscribers  offset by a net increase of approximately million in service revenue from our prepaid subscribers 
the decrease in post paid service revenue was due primarily to a decline in average monthly service revenue per post paid user  and was partially offset by an increase in revenue attributable to the increase in the average number of direct post paid subscribers 
the increase in prepaid service revenue was primarily due to an increase in the average number of direct prepaid subscribers  partially offset by a decline in average monthly service revenue per prepaid subscriber 
wholesale  affiliate and other revenue wholesale  affiliate and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of wireless services to companies that resell those services to their subscribers and net revenues retained from wireless subscribers residing in pcs affiliate territories 
wholesale  affiliate and other revenues decreased in as compared 
table of contents to due to a decline in average monthly service revenue per wholesale subscriber 
wholesale  affiliate and other revenues increased in as compared to primarily due to increases in our wholesale operators subscribers 
cost of services cost of services consists primarily of costs to operate and maintain our cdma and iden networks  including direct switch and cell site costs  such as rent  utilities  maintenance  payroll costs associated with our network employees and spectrum frequency leasing costs  fixed and variable interconnection costs  the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site  and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline providers for calls terminating on their networks  which fluctuates in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls  long distance costs paid to the wireline segment  costs to service and repair handsets  roaming fees paid to other carriers  and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications  such as ringers  games  music  tv and navigation services by our subscribers 
cost of services increased in as compared to  primarily reflecting increased costs relating to data and voice roaming outside of our networks and increased service and repair costs related to devices with increased functionality 
in addition  backhaul costs  including usage of our wireline network  have increased primarily due to increased data usage by our subscribers and the expansion of ev do rev 
a in our network 
these costs have been slightly offset by lower employee related and outside services costs 
cost of services increased in as compared to primarily due to increased network costs 
specifically we experienced increased roaming expenses  mainly from subscribers of our cdma services  due to increased data and voice usage outside of our cdma network 
we also experienced an increase in the operational costs of our cell sites and switches  including increases in rent and fixed and variable interconnection costs due to the increase in usage  number of cell sites and related equipment in service 
subsidy we recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of handsets and accessories when title to the handset or accessory passes to the dealer or end user customer 
our marketing plans assume that handsets typically will be sold at prices below our cost  which is consistent with industry practice  as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new handsets at discounted prices 
we reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the customer  or for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber 
additionally  we reduce the cost of handsets by any rebates that we earn from the supplier 
cost of handsets and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of handset and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence 
equipment costs in excess of the revenues generated from equipment sales referred to in our industry as subsidy as a percentage of equipment revenues increased to in from in and in the increase in subsidy in as compared to is primarily due to a decline in equipment revenue  primarily due to a decrease in the number of handsets sold  slightly offset by  
table of contents a decrease in the cost of handsets and accessories  primarily due to a decrease in the number of handsets sold which was mostly offset by an increase in the average cost per handset sold as we continue to sell a greater number of higher priced units  including several new devices with increased functionality introduced during the increase in subsidy in as compared to is primarily due to an decline in equipment revenue  primarily due to a decrease in the average sales price of handsets due to more aggressive acquisition and retention handset pricing  which was only slightly offset by an increase in the number of handsets sold  and a increase in the cost of handsets and accessories due to the increase in the number of handsets sold and an increase in the average cost of the units sold 
selling  general and administrative expense sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs  including commissions paid to our indirect dealers  third party distributors and direct sales force for new handset activations and upgrades  residual payments to our indirect dealers  payroll and facilities costs associated with our direct sales force  retail stores and marketing employees  advertising  media programs and sponsorships  including costs related to branding 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing  customer care and information technology operations  bad debt expense and back office support activities  including collections  legal  finance  human resources  strategic planning and technology and product development 
sales and marketing expense decreased in from as compared to an increase of in from the decline in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to our decline in gross subscriber additions and a decline in advertising expenses and labor related costs due to our cost reduction activities 
during the year ended december   advertising expenses increased  as we promoted our brand in an effort to gain market share and build loyalty among existing subscribers 
we also increased compensation of our post paid third party dealers for both new subscriber additions and upgrades 
general and administrative costs decreased in from as compared to an increase of in from the decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended december  is principally due to the decrease in bad debt expense and lower employee related costs  offset by an increase in customer care related costs 
bad debt expense was million for the year ended december  representing a million decline  as compared to the million increase in to million 
our improvement in bad debt expense is largely attributable to credit policies for new customers and customer care initiatives we launched in late specifically  our ratio of subscribers with a prime credit rating to those with a subprime credit rating has continued to improve since december  we also have several customer care and collection activities designed to proactively contact subscribers to ensure they are on appropriate service plans based on their usage and to negotiate payment arrangements designed to help the customers through difficult financial times 
as a result  we have noted a decrease in involuntary churn and the number of accounts written off 
the increase in bad debt expense in was due to higher average write offs per account due to a higher number of subscribers per account  increased add a phone activity  increased incidence of overages  increased fees related to data services and increased credit extended in early and wireless segment earnings wireless segment earnings decreased about billion  or  in from primarily due to the decline in wireless service revenue principally driven by net direct subscriber losses 
wireless segment earnings decreased about billion  or  in from  primarily due to increases in costs to acquire our subscribers  lower equipment revenue  and increases in network and interconnection costs 
wireless segment earnings were billion in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents we expect to experience continued downward pressure on wireless segment earnings and cash flow from operations until we can reverse our net direct subscriber losses described in wireless service revenue 
given the current economic environment and the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting  we are unable to say with assurance the expected effects of direct subscriber declines on our wireless service revenue 
however  our actual direct subscriber losses of million can be expected to cause service revenue to be approximately lower than service revenues would have been had we not lost those subscribers 
if we were to experience the same level of direct subscriber losses in as we did in  direct subscriber losses would further reduce service revenue by approximately 
we have also recently lowered the prices of certain handset devices and continue to make targeted investments to improve subscriber results  which may cause an increase in our equipment net subsidy  which could increase the overall cost to acquire and retain subscribers 
management is implementing a cost reduction program designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs  however  we do not expect that the reduction in cash costs will offset the reduced cash expected from our service revenue declines in the near term

the decrease was primarily a result of certain business subscribers that were transferred to embarq as part of the spin off in the second quarter  as well as a decrease in our customer base and continued price declines 
also contributing to the decrease is the loss of conference line subscribers due to the final transition of those activities in the third quarter as part of the sale of that business

depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense increased in from  primarily due to increases to our in service network assets 
these increases were partially offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated and the impact of our annual review of depreciation rates and lives completed in the first quarter these rate changes were primarily related to net changes in the remaining service lives of assets primarily in the cdma network 
the impact of these changes reduced annual depreciation expense by about million  including million in the wireless segment and about million in the wireline segment 

table of contents depreciation expense in declined as compared to the depreciation expense includes about a million decrease related to depreciation rate changes with respect to our cdma and wireline networks assets  resulting from our depreciable lives study 
these rate changes are primarily related to net changes in the remaining service lives of certain assets 
the decreases resulting from the depreciation rate changes were fully offset by normal additions to our network asset base 
amortization expense declined in from and declined in from  primarily due to the amortization of the customer relationships acquired as part of the sprint nextel merger  which are amortized using the sum of the years digits method  resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time

we recorded net income of billion in primarily due to increased revenue in our wireless segment resulting from the sprint nextel merger and the pcs affiliate and nextel partners acquisitions 
we expect downward pressure on our consolidated results of operations in the near term caused principally by the expected decline in wireless segment earnings and severance costs associated with our work force reduction announced in january see forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider the following accounting policies and estimates to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations  either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because they require the exercise of significant judgment and or use of significant estimates 
while management believes that the estimates used are reasonable  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues  revenues generated from handset and accessory sales  revenues from wholesale operators and pcs affiliates  as well as local and long distance voice  data and internet revenues 
service revenues consist of fixed monthly recurring charges  variable usage charges such as roaming  directory assistance and operator assisted calling and miscellaneous fees  such as activation  upgrade  late payment  reconnection and early termination fees and certain regulatory related fees 
we recognize service revenues as services are rendered and equipment revenue when title passes to the dealer or end user customer 
we recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period  net of credits and adjustments for service discounts  billing disputes and fraud or unauthorized usage 
we recognize excess wireless usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used 
additionally  we recognize excess wireless data usage based on kilobytes and one time use charges  such as for the use of premium services  when rendered 
as a result of the cutoff times of our multiple billing cycles each month  we are required to estimate the amount of subscriber revenues earned but not billed from the end of each bill cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and our historical usage and billing patterns 
subscriber revenue earned but not billed represented about of our accounts receivable balance as of december  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses 
because of the number of accounts that we have  it is not practical to review the collectibility of each of those accounts individually when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts each period  although we do perform some account level analysis with respect to large wireless and wireline subscribers 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors  including collection experience  aging of the accounts receivable portfolios  the credit quality of our subscriber base  estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales and other qualitative considerations  including macro economic 
table of contents factors 
the accounting estimates related to the recognition of revenue require us to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with subscribers  unauthorized usage  and future returns and mail in rebates on handset sales 
the allowance amounts recorded represent our best estimate of future outcomes  to the extent that our actual experience differs significantly from historical trends  the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate 
any resulting adjustments would change the net accounts receivable reported on our consolidated balance sheet  and bad debt expense  in the case of estimates related to doubtful accounts  or revenue  in the case of estimates related to other allowances  reported in our results of operations in future periods 
for example  if our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate were to change by  it would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of about million for the wireless segment and million for the wireline segment 
device and accessory inventory inventories of handsets and accessories in the wireless segment are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we determine cost by the first in  first out method 
handset costs and related revenues generated from handset sales  or handset subsidies  are recognized at the time of sale 
we do not recognize the expected handset subsidies prior to the time of sale because the promotional discount decision is made at the point of sale and or because we expect to recover the handset subsidies through service revenues 
as of december   we held million of inventory 
we analyze the realizable value of our handset and other inventory on a quarterly basis 
this analysis includes assessing obsolescence  sales forecasts  product life cycle  marketplace and other considerations 
if our assessments regarding the above factors change  we may be required to sell handsets at a higher subsidy or potentially record expense in future periods prior to the point of sale to the extent that we expect that we will be unable to sell handsets with a service contract 
other than temporary impairment of investments and marketable securities we hold a portfolio of investments that include marketable and non marketable debt and equity securities 
we evaluate such investments for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
other than temporary impairment occurs when the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value  and we determine that difference is not recoverable in the near future 
this evaluation requires significant judgment regarding  but not limited to  the severity and duration of the impairment  our ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery  financial condition  liquidity  and near term prospects of the issuer  specific events  and other factors 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances 
our only material investment is our billion investment in clearwire  which we have held since we closed our transaction with clearwire on november  our book value per share in clearwire was per share at year end  as compared to the year end clearwire stock price of  and the stock price has continued to decline subsequent to the balance sheet date 
as further discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have concluded as of december  that the decline is temporary and the stock price is expected to recover in the near future 
we will continue to evaluate our investment in clearwire every quarter and update our conclusions based upon the facts and circumstances in place at that time 
if such facts and circumstance change  for example if clearwire s stock price continues to remain at a depressed level for a longer duration of time  it is possible that we may record an impairment in future periods on this investment that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation and recoverability of long lived assets including definite lived intangible assets a significant portion of our total assets are long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets 
changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 

table of contents property  plant and equipment represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we generally calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives as follows long lived assets estimated useful life average useful life buildings and improvements to years years network equipment  site costs and software to years years non network internal use software  office equipment and other to years years we calculate depreciation on certain of our assets using the group life method 
accordingly  ordinary asset retirements and disposals on those assets are charged against accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized 
gains or losses associated with non monetary exchanges and asset retirements or disposals on non network equipment are recorded within asset impairments in the consolidated statements of operations 
since changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors  may cause the estimated period of use of these assets to change  we perform annual studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property  plant and equipment 
these studies take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution  to calculate the remaining life of our asset base 
when these factors indicate that an asset s useful life is different from the previous assessment  we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life 
during the first quarter  we implemented depreciation rate and life changes with respect to certain assets that comprise the wireless and wireline networks resulting from our annual depreciable lives study 
these revised rates reflected both changes in the useful life estimates of certain of our asset groups and adjustments to our accumulated depreciation accounts under the group life depreciation method 
the reduced expense associated with the depreciation rate and life changes resulted in an approximately million reduction  or per share savings  net of tax  in the net loss for the year ended december  in addition to performing our annual study  we also continue to assess the estimated useful life and future strategic plans of our wireless and wireline network assets  which had a net carrying value of billion and billion  respectively  as of december  a reduction in our estimate of the useful lives of those network assets would cause increased depreciation charges in future periods that could be material 
for example  a reduction in the remaining weighted average useful lives of the network assets would increase annual wireless and wireline depreciation expense by about million and million  respectively 
in conjunction with our fourth quarter annual goodwill impairment review  we re assessed the remaining useful lives of our long lived assets and concluded they were appropriate 
intangible assets with definite useful lives represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships that are amortized over two to five years using the sum of the years digits method  which we believe best reflects the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed 
other definite lived intangible assets primarily include certain rights under affiliation agreements that we reacquired in connection with the acquisitions of certain pcs affiliates and nextel partners  which are being amortized over the remaining terms of those affiliation agreements on a straight line basis  and the nextel and direct connect trade names  which are being amortized over ten years on a straight line basis 
we also evaluate the remaining useful lives of our definite lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization  which would be addressed prospectively 
for example  we review certain trends such as subscriber churn  average revenue per subscriber  revenue  our future plans regarding our networks and changes in marketing strategies  among others 
significant changes in certain trends may cause us to adjust  on a prospective basis  the remaining estimated life of certain of our definite lived intangible assets 
for additional information  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we determine our long lived asset groups based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
our asset groups consist of wireless and wireline  and the wireless asset group currently includes our intangible assets and our wireless property  plant and equipment 
indicators of impairment for our asset groups include  but are not limited to  a sustained significant decrease in the market price of  or the cash flows expected to be derived from  the asset groups  or a significant change in the extent or manner in which the assets in the group are utilized 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of an indicator of impairment that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets 
impairment analyses  when performed  are based on our current business and technology strategy  our views of growth rates for our business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
in conjunction with our and annual assessments of goodwill for impairment  we performed a recoverability test of the wireless long lived assets 
the future cash flows used in the recoverability test included cash flow projections from our wireless operations along with cash flows associated with the eventual disposition of the long lived assets  which included estimated proceeds from the sale of fcc licenses  trade names and customer relationships 
in both the and assessments of long lived assets  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the wireless asset group exceeded its book value and  as a result  no impairment charge was recorded 
while the estimated difference in is significant  it is less than the difference calculated in due to expected lower future cash flows from our wireless operations 
if we continue to have operational challenges  including obtaining and retaining subscribers  our future cash flows may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group and we could record asset impairments that are material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to the analyses described above  we periodically assess certain assets that have not yet been deployed in our business  including network equipment  cell site development costs and software in development  to determine if an impairment charge is required 
network equipment and cell site development costs are impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances cause us to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet management s strategic network plans and will not be deployed 
software development costs are impaired when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed 
we also periodically assess network equipment that has been removed from the network to determine if an impairment is required 
the substantial majority of our million of asset impairments in related to such assessments 
if we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iden network  management may conclude in future periods that certain cdma and iden assets will never be either deployed or redeployed  in which case we would recognize a non cash impairment that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
valuation and recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets intangible assets with indefinite useful lives represented billion of our billion in total assets as of december  we have identified fcc licenses and our sprint and boost mobile trademarks as indefinite lived intangible assets  in addition to our previously recorded goodwill  after considering the expected use of the assets  the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used  and the effects of obsolescence on their use 
we review our goodwill  which was solely related to our wireless reporting unit  and other indefinite lived intangibles annually in the fourth quarter for impairment  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the 
table of contents business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or slower growth rates  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
when required  we first test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our wireless reporting unit with its net book value 
if the fair value of the wireless reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired  and no further testing would be necessary 
if the net book value of our wireless reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
to measure the amount of any impairment loss  we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if our wireless reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet  we record an impairment charge for the difference 
the valuation analyses used in our estimate of fair value utilize both income and market approaches as described below income approach to determine its estimated fair value  we discount the expected cash flows of the wireless reporting unit 
we estimate our future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends  estimated future operating results  our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions  and the availability of necessary technology  network infrastructure  handsets and other devices 
the discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in our wireless operations and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model  we use a terminal value approach 
under this approach  we use estimated operating income before depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model  adjust it to estimate a normalized cash flow  apply a perpetuity growth assumption and discount by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value 
we incorporate the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value 
market based approach to corroborate the results of the income approach described above  we estimate the fair value of our wireless reporting unit using several market based approaches  including the guideline company method  which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar guideline publicly traded companies 
the determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit and other assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  operating income before depreciation and amortization  or oibda  and capital expenditures forecasts 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we evaluate the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to determine the fair value of the wireless reporting unit  as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit  for reasonableness 
the allocation of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit to individual assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including  among others  customer relationships  fcc licenses  trademarks and current replacement costs for certain property  plant and equipment 
in fourth quarter  we impaired the remaining million of our goodwill 
refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents when required  we test other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment by comparing the asset s respective carrying value to estimates of fair value  determined using the direct value method 
our fcc licenses were combined into two units of accounting  which consisted of our mhz  mhz and ghz bands as one unit of accounting and our ghz band as another unit of accounting 
our licenses in the ghz band were subsequently contributed to clearwire on november   accordingly  we will only have one unit of accounting in future analyses 
the accounting estimates related to our indefinite lived intangible assets require us to make significant assumptions about fair values 
our assumptions regarding fair values require significant judgment about economic factors  industry factors and technology considerations  as well as our views regarding the prospects of our business 
changes in these judgments may have a significant effect on the estimated fair values 
tax valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions we are required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
we record valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if we determine it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
the accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
these assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
the impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material 
we carried an income tax valuation allowance of million as of december  this amount includes a valuation allowance of million for the total tax benefits related to loss carryforwards  subject to utilization restrictions  acquired in connection with certain acquisitions 
the remainder of the valuation allowance relates to tax credits and state net operating loss carryforwards 
within our total valuation allowance  we had million related to separate company state net operating losses incurred by our subsidiaries after we acquired them 
the valuation allowance was provided on these separate company state net operating loss benefits since these subsidiaries do not have a sufficient history of taxable income 
current analyses of cumulative historical income and qualitative factors indicate that the valuation allowance continues to be appropriate  meaning that we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize such tax benefits in the future 
we will continue to monitor these analyses and factors in future periods and may adjust the valuation allowance based on the facts and circumstances existing in future periods 
we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes  on january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits 
if we determine it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits  we record the impact of the position in our consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
these estimates are updated based on the facts  circumstances and information available 
we are also required to assess at each annual reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fin the total unrecognized tax benefits decreased by million during this reduction was principally attributable to income tax settlements and lapses of statute of limitations in various tax jurisdictions 
as these uncertain tax benefits were originally acquired in purchase business combinations  other non current intangible assets were reduced 

table of contents the various irs and state income tax reviews disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements continue to progress and we expect that certain of these may be completed in the next twelve months 
based on our current knowledge of the examinations  administrative reviews and appellate processes  we believe it is reasonably possible many of our uncertain tax positions could be resolved during the next twelve months which could result in a reduction of up to approximately million in our unrecognized tax benefits 
any changes to the unrecognized tax benefits made after december  will impact tax expense  including those changes related to acquired income tax uncertainties from prior business combinations  except for qualified measurement period adjustments 
actual income tax assets and liabilities could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law  significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate  our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year s liability by taxing authorities 
these changes could have a significant impact on our financial position

such significant changes include  but are not limited  to the acquirer recording of all assets and liabilities  including goodwill  of the acquired business  generally at their fair values  and acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs being expensed rather than included as part of the purchase price allocation process 
in addition  after the effective date  reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties related to any business combinations  even those completed prior to the statement s effective date  will generally be recognized in earnings

while certain changes in ownership interests will be treated as equity transactions under the new standard  a gain or loss recognized upon loss of control of a subsidiary will be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
this practice differs from our current policy of recognizing such gains or losses as a component of equity 
in addition  the amount of gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling interest at the date control ceases

liquidity as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled billion 
we depend on these funds as well as cash provided by operating activities and cash available under our revolving bank credit facility to satisfy our liquidity needs 
our revolving bank credit facility expires in december in february  we drew down billion under our revolving bank credit facility 
the proceeds were used to repay billion in senior notes during the second and third quarters of and billion of our revolving bank credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of in april  we repaid in full all outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program  which we subsequently terminated 
on november   we entered into an agreement to amend the terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility giving us greater flexibility regarding our financial covenants 
pursuant to the amendment  the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring charges increased from no more than to to no more than to as of december   the ratio was to the new terms of the revolving bank credit facility provide for an interest rate equal to the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a margin of between and  depending on our debt ratings 
the interest rate prior to the amendment was libor plus a margin of 
certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility 
under this revolving bank credit facility  we may not pay cash dividends unless our ratio of total indebtedness is less than to in addition  the amendment reduced the revolving bank credit facility from billion to billion 
we also reduced the outstanding loan balance from billion to billion 
as of december   we had billion in letters of credit  including a billion letter of credit required by the report and order to reconfigure the mhz band  outstanding under our billion revolving bank credit facility 
as a result of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility and the outstanding letters of credit  each of which directly impacts the availability of the revolving bank credit facility  we had billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of december  
table of contents a default under our credit facilities could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations  including our senior notes  which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated 
the indentures that govern our outstanding senior notes also require that we comply with various covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by us and our subsidiaries 
all three agencies rate our senior unsecured debt below investment grade 
on may   standard poor s lowered our rating to bb 
they rate our outlook as stable 
on december   moody s investors service lowered our rating to ba at the same time  they raised our amended bank credit facility rating to baa they rate our outlook as negative 
on february   fitch ratings lowered our rating to bb 
they rate our outlook as negative 
downgrades of our current ratings to below investment grade do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt  however  downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our borrowings and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets 
as of december   we had working capital of billion compared to a working capital deficit of million as of december   with the change primarily due to the reduction in our current liabilities 
in addition  during  we reclassified approximately million in deferred tax assets out of working capital due to the anticipated timing of the realization of those deferred tax benefits 
this reclassification reduced our long term deferred tax liabilities and our current deferred tax assets 
in light of conditions in our business and financial markets  we decided in early that we will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
in addition  under our amended bank credit facility  we are currently restricted from paying any cash dividends as a result of our ratio of total indebtedness as described above 
future outlook we are committed to both adding new and retaining our wireless subscribers in order to reverse the negative subscriber trends that we have experienced in recent periods 
these subscriber losses have and will further decrease our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or adjusted ebitda  as defined by our revolving bank credit facility 
management is implementing a cost reduction program designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs  however we do not expect that the reduction in cash costs will offset the reduced cash expected from our service revenue declines described above 
see forward looking statements 
our decline in adjusted ebitda has also caused the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring charges to increase 
we currently expect to remain in compliance with our covenants and expect to be able to meet our debt service requirements through at least the end of  although there can be no assurance that we will do so 
although we expect to improve our subscriber results  if we do not execute as planned  depending on the severity of the actual subscriber results versus what we currently anticipate  it is possible that we would not remain in compliance with our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations  which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness 
if such unforeseen events occur  we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings  although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions 
specifically  we expect to be able to meet our currently identified funding needs for at least the next months by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand  and or any remaining borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility 

table of contents in making this assessment  we have considered anticipated levels of capital expenditures and fcc license acquisitions  anticipated payments under the report and order  as supplemented  any contributions we may make to our pension plan  which has been negatively impacted by the high degree of volatility in the global financial markets experienced during the year ended december   scheduled debt service requirements  and other future contractual obligations 
if there are material changes in our business plans  or currently prevailing or anticipated economic conditions in any of our markets or competitive practices in the mobile wireless communications industry  or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow or profitability  anticipated cash needs could change significantly 
the conclusion that we expect to meet our funding needs for at least the next months as described above does not take into account any significant acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities or spectrum acquisition strategies  potential material purchases or redemptions of our outstanding debt securities for cash  and potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates 
any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources  including existing cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility 
if existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs  it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs 
our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets 
given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets  we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital 
we have in the past and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential sources of new capital to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs 
at present  we have no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of additional capital 
the above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under forward looking statements and part i  item a risk factors in this report 

table of contents future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations as of december  the information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon  among other things  the terms of the relevant agreements  appropriate classification of items under generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  currently in effect and certain assumptions  such as future interest rates 
future events  including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see forward looking statements 
future contractual obligations total and thereafter in millions senior notes  bank credit facilities and debentures capital leases and financing obligation operating leases purchase orders and other commitments total includes principal and estimated interest payments 
interest payments are based on management s expectations for future interest rates 
represents capital lease payments including interest and the towerco financing obligation

see below for further discussion 
purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them 
they include agreements for access and backhaul and customer billing services  advertising services and contracts related to information technology and customer care outsourcing arrangements 
amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted  subscribers and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the delivery of functioning software or products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
the table above also excludes about million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified 
no time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding 
as a result  they are not firm commitments 
the table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligation under the report and order 
the report and order requires us to make a payment to the us treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the ghz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the mhz and mhz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs  or qualifying costs  that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities 
the total minimum cash obligation for the report and order is billion 
from the inception of the program through december   we have incurred approximately billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program 
this amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program 
we estimate  based on our 
table of contents experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available  that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between and billion 
accordingly  we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the us treasury 
our liability for uncertain tax positions was million as of december  due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions  it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular years in the table 
off balance sheet financing we do not participate in  or secure  financings for any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
financial strategies general risk management policies we primarily use derivative instruments for hedging and risk management purposes 
hedging activities may be done for various purposes  including  but not limited to  mitigating the risks associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes  credit support agreements  continual review and monitoring of all counterparties  and thorough legal review of contracts 
we also control exposure to market risk by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits 
our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions  and all transactions comply with the policy 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments  usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates  foreign currencies  and equity prices 
the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
interest rate risk the communications industry is a capital intensive  technology driven business 
we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
specific interest rate risk includes the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings 
cash flow hedges we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate movements on future interest expense by effectively converting a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
as of december   we had no outstanding interest rate cash flow hedges 

table of contents fair value hedges we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate movements and achieve an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt while minimizing liquidity risk 
the interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively convert our fixed rate debt to a floating rate by receiving fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount 
as of december   we had no outstanding interest rate fair value hedges 
about of our debt as of december  was fixed rate debt 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
we perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt 
these analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt 
a decline in market interest rates would cause a million increase in the fair market value of our debt to billion 
foreign currency risk we also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow 
we use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries 
the dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was million as of december  the potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant 
equity risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes 
these securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate 
these securities  which are classified in investments and marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets  include equity method investments  such as our investment in clearwire  investments in private securities  available for sale securities and equity derivative instruments 
additional information regarding our derivative instruments can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in certain business transactions  we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates 
these warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments
