see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop and market technology solutions that allow applications to be delivered  supported  and shared on demand with high performance  enhanced security  and improved total cost of ownership  or tco 
we market and license our products through multiple channels such as value added resellers  or vars  channel distributors  system integrators  independent software vendors  our websites and original equipment manufacturers 
executive summary our solutions can fundamentally change an information technology organization s approach and strategic value  transforming information technology  or it  into an on demand service by centralizing the delivery of applications and desktops 
further  this approach to it transforms data centers  making them far more flexible to adapt to the changing needs of an enterprise 
we believe citrix s approach is unique in the market because we have combined innovative technologies in the areas of application virtualization  desktop virtualization  server virtualization and application networking  to deliver the most comprehensive end to end application delivery solution marketed as citrix delivery center one that  when considered as a whole  is competitively differentiated by its interoperability and feature set 

table of contents the recent crisis in the credit markets  difficulties in the financial services sector and the overall weakness in the global economy  is impacting it spending 
we are seeing it projects delayed and in many cases re evaluated altogether 
this environment could cause our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases  which could reduce sales of our products and result in longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
at the same time  however  this environment puts a much sharper focus on it that can reduce cost and delivers quick  tangible return on investment  or roi 
with our customers focused on economic value in technology solutions  we intend to highlight our solutions proven abilities to significantly reduce it costs  increase business flexibility  and deliver roi xenapp and xendesktop  for example  can reduce the cost of traditional desktop management by virtualizing the desktop and applications in the datacenter  where they are more easily and efficiently maintained and altered 
xenserver and netscaler can alter the traditional economies of the data center by providing much greater levels of flexibility of computing resources  especially servers  by improving application performance  thus reducing the amount of processing power involved  and allowing easy reconfiguration of servers to use for multiple purposes 
further  we will endeavor to sustain the long term growth of our businesses and enhance our current solution set through technological innovation  engineering excellence  selective and strategic acquisition of technology  talent and or companies  and a commitment to delivering high quality products and services to customers and partners 
we expect to continue to make strategic investments in research and development of existing and new products and we will also invest in research and development of advanced technologies for future application  including server and desktop delivery infrastructure products 
we believe that delivering innovative and high value solutions through citrix delivery center is the key to meeting customer and partner needs and achieving our future growth 
further  from an operations standpoint  in order to operate more efficiently and to drive long term changes in our cost model  on january   we announced the implementation of a strategic restructuring program  or the strategic restructuring program 
the strategic restructuring program includes steps to reduce our headcount by approximately full time positions  representing approximately of our global workforce  or the global workforce reduction 
in addition  we are postponing merit increases that would normally occur in the second quarter of until the fourth quarter of  and the merit increases for all vice presidents and company officers have been eliminated 
in the first quarter of  we expect to incur a pre tax charge in the range of approximately million to million primarily related to our global workforce reduction 
in addition  the global workforce reduction is expected to result in an annualized pre tax savings of approximately million 
also  as part of the strategic restructuring program  we are in the process of assessing the consolidation of facilities and roles across all groups and geographies to reduce redundancy and increase standardization 
in addition  we are taking further steps to reduce operating costs that include reprioritizing internal projects  reducing contract workers and limiting travel spending 
summary of results for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   we delivered the following financial performance product license revenue increased to million  license updates revenue increased to million  online services revenue increased to million  technical services revenue increased to million  operating income decreased to million  and diluted earnings per share decreased to 
the increase in our product license revenue was primarily driven by increased sales across all of our product groupings 
we currently expect product license sales to decrease when comparing the first quarter of to the first quarter of primarily due to anticipated continued weakness in the global economy and its anticipated impact on our customers it spending  as described above 
the increase in license updates revenue was driven by increased renewals of our subscription advantage product over a larger subscriber base and to a lesser extent an increase in subscription advantage associated with new product licenses 
our online services revenue increased due to continued sales strength of our real time collaboration services and to a lesser extent our web based access products 
we currently expect our online services revenue to increase slightly when comparing the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of  however  we anticipate the overall rate of growth for this group to be slower than experienced in the decrease in operating income is primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expense primarily related to stock based awards assumed in conjunction with our xensource acquisition 

table of contents in addition  the recent financial crisis in the credit markets has caused some of our investments to experience other than temporary declines in fair value  which have resulted in impairment charges and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
we do not currently anticipate that the lack of liquidity caused by holding these investments will have a material adverse effect on our operating cashflows or financial position 
we continue to monitor our overall investment portfolio and if the credit ratings of the issuers of our investments deteriorate or if the issuers experience financial difficulty  including bankruptcy  we may be required to make additional adjustments to the carrying value of the securities in our investment portfolio and recognize additional impairment charges for declines in fair value which are determined to be other than temporary 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
acquisition in october  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding securities of vapps  inc  or vapps  a privately held delaware corporation headquartered in hoboken  new jersey 
vapps offers high quality audio conferencing solutions to small and medium sized businesses and enterprise and service provider markets that complement our online services products 
the total consideration for this transaction was approximately million in cash  including million in transaction costs 
in addition  if certain financial and operational milestones are achieved by the vapps business  contingent consideration of up to approximately million may be earned 
the sources of funds for this transaction consisted of available cash and investments 
in addition  we assumed approximately million unvested stock options upon the closing of the transaction 
revenues from vapps are included in our online services revenue 
the vapps results of operations have been included in our consolidated results of operations beginning after the date of its acquisition and are not significant in relation to our consolidated financial statements 
under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price for vapps was allocated to the acquired company s net tangible and intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the allocation of the total purchase price is summarized below in thousands purchase price allocation asset life current assets property and equipment various other assets in process research and development intangible assets  years goodwill  indefinite assets current liabilities non current liabilities net assets current assets acquired and current liabilities assumed in connection with vapps consisted mainly of accounts receivable and other accrued expenses 
other assets and non current liabilities consisted primarily of deferred taxes 
the million of goodwill related to vapps was assigned to our online services segment and is not deductible for tax purposes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for segment information 
acquisitions during  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies  ardence delaware inc  a leading provider of solutions that allow information technology administrators to set up and configure pcs  servers  and web servers in real time from a centrally managed source  and xensource  inc  a privately held leader in enterprise grade virtual infrastructure solutions  collectively the acquisitions 
the acquisitions positioned us in adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets that will allow us to continue to extend our leadership in the broader application delivery infrastructure market 
the total consideration for the acquisitions was approximately million  comprised of approximately million shares of our common stock valued at million  million in cash and approximately million in direct transaction costs 
in addition  in connection with the acquisitions  we issued approximately million unvested shares of our common stock  million non vested stock units and assumed approximately million stock options each of which will be exercisable for the right to receive one share of our common stock upon vesting 
revenues from the products acquired in the acquisitions are primarily included in our product license revenue 
the acquisitions results of operations have been included in our consolidated results of operations beginning after the date of each of the acquisitions 
the source of funds for the cash consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments 
in connection with the acquisitions  we allocated million to goodwill  million to product related intangible assets and million to other intangible assets 

table of contents acquisitions during  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of two privately held companies  reflectent software  inc  a provider of solutions to monitor the real time performance of client server  web and desktop applications from an end user perspective  and orbital data corporation  a provider of solutions that optimize the delivery of applications over wide area networks  collectively the acquisitions 
the total consideration for the acquisitions was million comprised of cash paid of million and other costs related primarily to direct transaction costs of million  including approximately million related to stock based awards that were granted and vested upon consummation of the acquisitions 
as part of the acquisitions  we assumed approximately million non vested stock based awards upon the closing of the transaction 
revenues from the acquired products are primarily included in our product license revenue and technical services revenue 
the sources of funds for consideration paid in these transactions consisted of available cash and investments 
in connection with the acquisitions  we allocated million to goodwill  million to product related technology and million to other intangible assets 
in process research and development for acquisitions the fair values used in determining the purchase price allocation for certain intangible assets for our acquisitions were based on estimated discounted future cash flows  royalty rates and historical data  among other information 
purchased in process research and development  or ipr d  was expensed immediately upon the closing of our acquisition of vapps in the amount of million  our acquisitions in the amount of million and our acquisitions in the amount of million 
such ipr d was expensed in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  due to the fact that it pertained to technology that was not currently technologically feasible  meaning it had not reached the working model stage  did not contain all of the major functions planned for the product  was not ready for initial customer testing and had no alternative future use 
the fair value assigned to in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a project s sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return  which ranged from 
the rate of return included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the ipr d 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions continue to decline  or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorate  we may be unable to determine that collectability is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 

table of contents we license most of our products bundled with a one year contract for license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and unspecified upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis 
customers may also elect to purchase subscriptions for license updates  when not bundled with the initial product license 
customers may also elect to purchase technical support  product training or consulting services 
we allocate revenue to license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the vsoe of fair value  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product on a stand alone basis or applicable renewal rates for subscriptions related to new products 
in the normal course of business  we are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any conditions  unless the product item is defective in manufacture  but we do provide most of our distributors with stock balancing and price protection rights 
stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty fifth day of the fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products 
product items returned to us under the stock balancing program must be in new  unused and unopened condition 
we establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights  as well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  recent and historical return rates for both  specific products and distributors  estimated distributor inventory levels by product  the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves 
our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns 
if actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user 
allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers 
accordingly  there were no reserves required for price protection at december  and december  we also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time the sale is recorded 
we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment on january  under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service or performance period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends 
for purposes of determining the expected volatility factor  we used the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the expected term of our options is based on historical employee exercise patterns 
we also analyzed our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on demographic characteristics 
the approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  we used a dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from 
table of contents those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards that vest based on service  including those with graded vesting schedules  are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
beginning in  we began issuing non vested stock units and non vested stock with performance goals to certain senior members of management 
the number of non vested stock units or non vested stock underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals 
we are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units or non vested stock that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
if our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change  the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met  no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options  non vested stock and non vested stock units 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information regarding our adoption of sfas no 
r 
valuation and classification of investments effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
under this standard  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
our investments are carried at fair value and in determining their fair value we are sometimes required to use various valuation techniques 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
sfas no 
establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  described as level  and the lowest priority to valuation techniques using unobservable inputs  described as level observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability that are based on market data obtained from independent sources  such as market quoted prices 
when level observable inputs for our investments are not available to determine their fair value  we must then use other inputs which may include indicative pricing for securities from the same issuer with similar terms or unobservable inputs that reflect our estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investments based on the best information available in the circumstances 
when valuation techniques  other than those described as level are utilized  management must make estimations and judgments in determining the fair value for its investments 
the degree to which management s estimation and judgment is required is generally dependent upon the market pricing available for the investments  the availability of observable inputs  the frequency of trading in the investments and the investment s complexity 
if we make different judgments regarding unobservable inputs we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments 
after we have determined the fair value of our investments  for those that are in an unrealized loss position  we must then determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we review our investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment and if different judgments are used the classification of the losses related to our investments could differ 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until it recovers 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the 
table of contents financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  rating agency actions  changes in credit default swap levels  changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors  and 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources for more information on our investments and fair value measurements 
product related technology assets we have acquired our product related technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements 
in applying purchase accounting  we allocate a portion of purchase price of acquired companies to the product related technology assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
we typically engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values and useful lives of product related technology assets acquired 
such valuations and useful life determinations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in determining the fair value and useful lives of the product related technology assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows earned from the product related technology and discount rates applied in determining the present value of those cash flows 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
we review acquired product related technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
the recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from product related technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors  and there is no alternative future use for the technology  we could determine that some or all of their remaining million carrying value is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill at december   we had million in goodwill related to our acquisitions 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
we operate in a single industry segment consisting of the design  development and marketing of technology solutions that deliver applications on demand 
our revenues are derived from sales of our citrix delivery center products and related technical services in the americas  emea  and asia pacific regions and from online services sold by our online services division 
these three geographic regions and the online services division constitute our reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information regarding our reportable segments 
we evaluate goodwill among these segments  which represent our reporting units 
excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of december  there were no impairment charges recorded as a result of our annual impairment tests 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy  product portfolio or reportable segments  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that a million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses from acquired companies and unrealized losses from temporary impairments on available for sale investments was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 

table of contents in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  our overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in overview and part item a entitled risk factors  which could impact our future performance and financial position

revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our channel distributors and vars 
license updates consist of fees related to our subscription advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of unspecified software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
online services revenues consist primarily of fees related to online service agreements and are recognized ratably over the contract term

while it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders  we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped 
although the amount of such product license orders may vary  the amount  if any  of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of the same period

operating expenses foreign currency impact on operating expenses a substantial majority of our overseas operating expenses and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks up to one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
when the dollar is weak  foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher 
these higher expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts 
if the dollar is strong  foreign currency denominated expenses will be lower  and our hedging practices will cause these lower expenses to be partially offset by the aggregate loss in our hedging contracts 
there is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk 
due to the generally stronger dollar during the year ended december  compared to  our operating expenses benefited when converted to us dollars  which was partially offset by lower gains in our hedging programs 
strategic restructuring impact on operating expenses on january   we announced the implementation of our strategic restructuring program  which includes among other things  steps to reduce our headcount by approximately full time positions  representing approximately of our global workforce  or the global workforce reduction 
in addition  we are postponing merit increases that would normally occur in the second quarter of until the fourth quarter of  and the merit increases for all vice presidents and company officers have been eliminated 
in the first quarter of  we expect to incur a pre tax charge in the range of approximately million to million primarily related to our global workforce reduction 
in addition  the global workforce reduction expected to result in an annualized pre tax savings of approximately million 
also  as part of the strategic restructuring program  we are in the process of assessing the consolidation of facilities and roles across all groups and geographies to reduce redundancy and increase standardization 
in addition  we are taking further steps to reduce operating costs that include reprioritizing internal projects  reducing contract workers and limiting travel spending 
due to the strategic restructuring program  we expect that in  we will experience decreases in operating expenses across all operating areas including research and development  sales  marketing and support and general and administrative expenses 

table of contents other items impacting operating expenses in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a reduction to operating expenses of approximately million related to an adjustment of payroll taxes initially recorded in conjunction with our voluntary  independent investigation of our historical stock option granting practices which were reduced upon agreement with the internal revenue service

the adoption of sfas no 
r is effective on a prospective basis for transactions occurring in historically  we have been acquisitive and if we continue to be so  sfas no r will cause increases in our operating expenses if we enter into business combinations with material deal or restructuring costs after the standard s effective date 
research and development expenses year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands research and development research and development expenses consisted primarily of personnel related costs 
we expensed substantially all development costs included in the research and development of our products and new functionality added to our existing products as incurred  except for certain core technologies which were technologically feasible 
research and development expenses increased during as compared to primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense primarily related to options and awards assumed in conjunction with our acquisition of xensource  inc  or the xensource acquisition

table of contents our efforts with respect to the acquired technologies currently consist of design and development that may be required to support the release of the technologies into updated versions of existing service offerings and potentially new product and service offerings related to the products acquired in our xensource  ardence  and netscaler acquisitions 
we currently expect that we will successfully develop new products or services utilizing the acquired in process technology  but there can be no assurance that commercial viability of future product or service offerings will be achieved 
furthermore  future developments in the software industry  changes in technology  changes in other products and offerings or other developments may cause us to alter or abandon product plans 
failure to complete the development of projects in their entirety  or in a timely manner  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fair value assigned to ipr d was based on valuations prepared using methodologies and valuation techniques consistent with those used by independent appraisers 
all fair values were determined using the income approach  which includes estimating the revenue and expenses associated with a project s sales cycle and by estimating the amount of after tax cash flows attributable to the projects 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return  which ranged from to 
the rate of return included a factor that takes into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the ipr d 
sfas no 
r will require  among other things  acquired ipr d assets to be capitalized 
if we enter into business combinations with material ipr d after january   the standard s effective date  we will be required to capitalize those costs  which will reduce operating expenses in the period of the acquisition and increase amortization of product related intangible assets if completion of development is reached which will be included in cost of net revenues in future periods 
interest income year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands interest income interest income decreased during as compared to primarily due to decreased interest rates earned on cash equivalents and investment balances 
we expect interest income to decrease in due to the effect of lower interest rates as a result of current market conditions 
interest income increased during as compared to primarily due to overall higher average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances that resulted primarily from an increase in cash from operations and proceeds received from employee stock based compensation plans  partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures

upon recording the put option  we contemporaneously made the fair value election as allowed by sfas no

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as of december   our net unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately million 
at december   there were no amounts for tax positions which would not affect the annual effective tax rate and approximately million of accrued interest on tax positions 
we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states as well as income taxes of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to the internal revenue service commenced an examination of our us federal income tax returns for and in the third quarter of we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income and gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that million valuation allowance relating to deferred tax assets for net operating losses from acquired companies and unrealized losses from temporary impairments on available for sale investments was necessary 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and its foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates 
we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
we establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  certain of these positions may be challenged 
while it is often difficult to predict whether we will prevail  we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
as such  included in our effective tax rate for the year ended december  is an additional tax reserve of approximately million related to uncertainties arising in partially offset by a reduction of approximately million in tax reserves related to the expiration of a statute of limitations for the tax year 
in  our effective tax rate increased to approximately from when comparing the three months ended december  to the three months ended december  primarily due to the fourth quarter of including the reduction in tax reserves for uncertain tax positions related to prior years taken in when comparing the twelve months ended december  to the twelve months ended december   our effective tax rate decreased to from primarily due to an increase in income in geographic locations that are taxed at lower rates and a corresponding decrease in income in geographic locations taxed at higher rates partially offset by the reduction in tax reserves for uncertain tax positions related to prior years taken in the decrease in income in geographic locations taxed at higher rates is primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets 
we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources during  we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
these cash flows related primarily to net income of million  adjusted for  among other things  non cash charges including stock based compensation expense of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
also attributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million  net of the effects of acquisitions 
these operating cash inflows are partially offset by a million benefit related to an adjustment of payroll taxes and million related to a deferred income tax benefit 
our investing activities used million of cash consisting primarily of the expenditure of million for the purchase of property and equipment  including the purchase of our headquarters building and million in cash paid for licensing agreements and acquisitions 
these investing cash outflows are partially offset by the net sales and maturities of our available for sale investments of million

also attributing to these cash inflows is an aggregate increase in cash flow from our operating assets and liabilities of million  net of the effects of acquisitions 
our investing activities used million consisting primarily of the net purchases after reinvestment  from sales and maturities of our available for sale investments of million 
these cash outflows also consisted of cash paid for our acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of million and the expenditure of million for the purchase of property and equipment 
our financing activities used cash of million primarily related to million paid under our stock repurchase programs and million paid on our debt 
these cash outflows are partially offset by million in proceeds received from employee stock compensation plans and million related to excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock based awards 
historically  significant portions of our cash inflows were generated by our operations 
we currently expect this trend to continue throughout we believe that our existing cash and investments together with cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we continue to search for suitable acquisition candidates and could acquire or make investments in companies we believe are related to our strategic objectives 
we could from time to time seek to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities for larger acquisitions 
cash and investments december  compared to in thousands cash and investments the increase in cash and investments at december  as compared to december   is primarily due to an increase in cash from operations and proceeds received from employee stock based compensation plans  partially offset by an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures  licensing agreements and acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in investment grade  highly liquid securities to allow for flexibility in the event of immediate cash needs 
our short term and long term investments primarily consist of interest bearing securities 
see liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information 
available for sale investments during  we recorded an unrealized loss of approximately million related to our million face value investment issued by aig matched funding corporation  or the aig capped floater  which matures in september american international group  inc  or aig  as the issuer s parent  provided a guarantee of the security at the time of purchase  in september the unrealized loss was primarily caused by aig experiencing liquidity challenges which were reportedly precipitated by problems in the capital markets 
aig s lack of liquidity triggered a downgrade in the credit ratings for its long term issues to a and a by two rating agencies on october  as a result of aig s liquidity challenges  the federal reserve intervened with a five year credit facility to help stabilize aig and the overall market 
to date  aig has not been reported to have defaulted on the terms of its loan from the federal reserve and continues to pay interest on the aig capped floater 
because we have the ability and intent to hold this security until a recovery of fair value  which may not occur until maturity  we do not consider the security to be other than temporarily impaired 

table of contents if aig s financial position further deteriorates  we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of the aig capped floater and potentially recognize an impairment charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of the investment 
based on our available cash and other investments  we do not currently anticipate that the lack of liquidity caused by holding the aig capped floater to recovery will have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
gross realized gains on sales of available for sale investments during were million and gross realized losses on available for sale investments during were million 
gross realized gains and losses on sales of available for sale investments during were not material 
the other than temporary losses on available for sale investments were primarily comprised of an impairment charge of approximately million related to an other than temporary impairment of an investment in our portfolio due to the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings 
we continue to monitor our overall investment portfolio and if the credit ratings of the issuers of our investments deteriorate or if the issuers experience financial difficulty  including bankruptcy  we may be required to make additional adjustments to the carrying value of the securities in our investment portfolio and recognize additional impairment charges for declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary 
trading investments as of december   we held triple a rated municipal auction rate securities  with an aggregate par value of approximately million  whose underlying assets are generally student loans that are substantially backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program through investment accounts managed by ubs financial services  inc  or ubs 
the market for municipal auction rate securities in our portfolio began experiencing auction failures on february  and there have been no successful auctions for the securities held in our portfolio since the failures began 
in november  we formally accepted the terms of a settlement from ubs 
upon accepting the terms of the settlement  we received the put option  that would enable us to sell our auction rate securities back to ubs during the period between june  and july  at par value 
accordingly  we recorded the fair value of the put option in other assets in our financial statements and contemporaneously made the fair value election as allowed by sfas no 
therefore beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began recording changes in the fair value of the put option in earnings 
in conjunction with recording the put option  we also transferred our auction rate securities from available for sale to trading in the fourth quarter of and recorded a million loss in other expense  net  upon the transfer 
accordingly  we will record changes in the fair value of our auction rate securities in earnings 
during the year ended december   we realized a gain of million related to the put option and realized a loss of million related to our investments in auction rate securities

fair value measurements on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which  among other things  defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would either be received to sell an asset or be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  sfas no 
establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs  other than the quoted prices in active markets  that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis we measure our cash flow hedges at fair value based on indicative prices in active markets and we generally measure our investments in available for sale securities at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
we measured our aig capped floater  which is included in level  using indicative pricing for another security issued by aig with similar terms which had regular trading activity 
due to the illiquidity in the municipal auction rate securities market caused by failed auctions  quoted prices in active markets are not currently available for our investments in municipal auction rate securities 
we measured these securities at fair value using a discounted cash flow model 
in our discounted cash flow model  we used several assumptions to derive a fair value for our investments in municipal auction rate securities including a discount rate based on the credit quality of the underlying investments and a factor to further discount the investments for the illiquidity currently present in the market for these securities 
accordingly  these securities changed from level to level within sfas no 
s three tier fair value hierarchy since valuation at december  also included in level is the put option 
in order to determine the fair value of the put option  we 
table of contents measured the differential between the aggregate par value of our auction rate securities and their fair value as of the reporting date and applied a discount rate that considers both the time period between the reporting date and the first date we are able to exercise our right to put the auction rate securities to ubs per the terms of the settlement and the credit worthiness of ubs

the initial term of the synthetic lease was seven years  expiring in april at any time during the lease term and upon a days written notice  we had the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed 
in october  we terminated the synthetic lease  purchased the underlying property and ceased to be bound by the lease covenants 
the majority of the amounts related to our synthetic lease collateral arrangement and classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments as of december   were used to purchase the property and are no longer restricted

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangement contractual obligations we have certain contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations in  we entered into a lease to acquire additional office space in santa clara  ca 
the rental commencement date will not begin until and the pricing for the lease will not be finalized until a future date 
accordingly  the future payment obligations related to this lease are not included in the table above 
purchase obligations represent non cancelable commitments to purchase inventory ordered before year end 
total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellations without payment provisions exist and excludes million of liabilities related to uncertain tax positions recorded in accordance with fin no 
 because we could not make reasonably reliable estimates of the period or amount of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for further information 
as of december   we did not have any individually material capital lease obligations or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
off balance sheet arrangement during  we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately million for our corporate headquarters office space in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease represented a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded of the costs of acquiring the property and leased the asset to us 
the synthetic lease qualified as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes 
we did not include the property or the related lease debt as an asset or a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
consequently  payments made pursuant to the lease were recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements 
the initial term of the synthetic lease was seven years  expiring in april the lease payments varied based on libor plus a margin 
at any time during the lease term and upon days written notice  we had the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed 
effective october   we exercised our option and purchased the property for approximately million  including closing costs and legal fees 
there were no lease breakage costs incurred 
the synthetic lease included certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a pledged balance of approximately million in cash and or investment securities as collateral 
this amount was included in restricted cash equivalents and investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the synthetic lease also included non financial covenants  including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance  prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property 
following the termination of the synthetic lease  we ceased to be bound by these covenants 
commitments capital expenditures were million during  million during and million during during  capital expenditures were primarily related to application and infrastructure delivery to enable growth and enhance management reporting capabilities  the purchase of our corporate headquarters buildings and leasehold improvements 
during  capital expenditures were primarily related to application and infrastructure delivery to enable growth and enhance management reporting capabilities and leasehold improvements 
we currently anticipate that capital expenditures will decrease in compared to levels 

table of contents we have an operating lease obligation related to a property that is not fully utilized that continues to with a total remaining obligation at december  of approximately million  of which million was accrued as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in consolidated financial statements 
in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than we estimated  the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
we currently expect that our liabilities related to operating lease obligations for properties that are not fully utilized will increase due to our strategic restructuring program 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 
discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  australian dollars  japanese yen  indian rupees  swiss francs  singapore dollars  hong kong dollars  canadian dollars  danish krone and swedish krona 
to reduce our exposure to a reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair liability value of million and at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of million 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million  resulting in a net asset position 
in these hypothetical movements  foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as the prices of our competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale and trading securities 
we maintain available for sale and trading investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale and trading are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million in each period 
if market interest rates were to decrease by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would increase by approximately million in each period 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale and trading investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 

table of contents during  we entered into the credit facility  as amended in  or the amended credit facility 
accordingly  we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
this exposure relates to our million amended credit facility 
borrowings under the amended credit facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we had no amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility as of december
