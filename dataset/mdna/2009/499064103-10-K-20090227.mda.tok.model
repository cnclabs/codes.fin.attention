introduction business overview we are a transportation services provider with headquarters in phoenix  arizona 
we transport general commodities for customers throughout the united states  generally focusing our operations on a short to medium length of haul 
we provide truckload carrier services from our asset based dry van and temperature controlled service centers  as well as brokerage services from our brokerage branches 
our asset based service centers and brokerage branches are successful  standalone businesses that complement one another to deliver solutions to our customers that otherwise wouldn t be possible 
the results of our brokerage activities were relatively immaterial for and  therefore  a detailed discussion of the financial results of these operations will not be separately presented 
from to  we achieved substantial revenue and income growth 
in and  our growth slowed as a result of economic conditions 
our revenue  before fuel surcharge  grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in  and our net income grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in during  we opened two dry van and two temperature controlled service centers 
as of december   we operated asset based dry van and temperature controlled service centers and brokerage branches 
our industry leading operating margins and debt free balance sheet have afforded us with substantial cash flows and financial flexibility 
during times of more robust freight demand  we have been able to expand our fleet and terminal network internally and through acquisitions largely through internally generated cash 
during times when fleet growth is undesirable  such as  we generate cash that can be used for stock repurchases  dividend payments  and as a source for future needs 
during  our cash and short term investment balance increased million  after using million for dividend payments and stock repurchases 
during  we were once again named to forbes magazine s list of the best small companies in america 
we have been included on this list for consecutive years 

table of contents operating and growth strategy our operating strategy is focused on the following core elements focusing on regional operations 
we seek to operate primarily in high density  predictable freight lanes in selected geographic regions 
we believe our regional operations allow us to obtain greater freight volumes and higher revenue per mile  and also enhance safety and driver recruitment and retention 
maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs 
we focus on operating in distinct geographic markets in order to achieve increased penetration of targeted service areas 
we actively seek to control costs by  among other things  operating modern equipment  maintaining a high driver to non driver employee ratio  and minimizing empty miles 
providing a high level of customer service 
we seek to compete on the basis of service  in addition to price  and offer our customers a broad range of services to meet their specific needs  including multiple stop pick ups and deliveries  on time pick ups and deliveries within narrow time frames  dedicated fleet and personnel  and specialized driver training 
using technology to enhance our business 
we use technology to help us be more efficient with our equipment and our headcount 
we recognize the value technology brings as an accelerator in our operations 
the primary source of our revenue growth has been our ability to open and develop service centers and brokerage branches and the markets they serve in selected geographic areas and operate the service centers at or near our targeted margins within a relatively short period of time 
the addition of our brokerage branches has enabled us to expand our customer service offerings by providing non asset based capabilities to our customers when the shipments do not fit our asset based model 
the development of our brokerage model strengthens our relationships with our customers because it provides our customers with more options and complements our existing dry van and temperature controlled truckload carrier services 
our brokerage model is also a less capital intensive way for us to grow our business 
the expansion of our services represents our continued progression as we build our brand as the premier national carrier  providing local service to the markets we serve 
the freight environment over the last several years has been challenging 
in  we did not experience a seasonal peak during the second half of the year  and economic activities fell off significantly in the fourth quarter 
price competition was tough  but the industry continued to rationalize 
many of the large fleets continued to downsize  and a good number of carriers closed their doors 
due to economic downturn  we reduced our fleet size modestly during the year to adapt to market conditions 
we believe we are well positioned to grow when the market reverts to more of a supply and demand equilibrium 
revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
the most significant expenses in our business include fuel  driver related expenses such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs which are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and depreciation of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and service centers and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio  excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
since our inception an important element of our asset based operating model has been an extreme focus on our cost per mile 
we intend to carry this focus with us as we add new service centers  grow existing service centers  and make selective acquisitions 

table of contents recent results of operations and year end financial condition our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  were as follows total revenue  including fuel surcharge  increased  to million from million  revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased  to million from million  net income decreased  to million from million  and net income per diluted share decreased to from 
represented one of the most difficult operating environments for the execution of our business model based on leading growth and profitability 
for the third consecutive year  a strong peak shipping season did not materialize 
the industry wide supply of truckload equipment continued to outpace the freight demand  which pressured pricing and resulted in lower equipment utilization 
we operated an average of fewer tractors in compared to and less at year end 
while revenue per total mile for improved as a result of a decrease in average length of haul  tractor utilization was negative  with average miles per tractor down for the year compared to a year ago 
our empty mileage factor for the year improved to in  from in our average length of haul decreased to miles during  from miles in both the difficult freight market and a softer market for used tractors and trailers contributed to a decrease in profitability in despite a year over year decline in our revenue  we were able to grow operating income by and diluted earnings per share by in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period a year ago 
profitability in the fourth quarter was helped by falling diesel prices  our ongoing internal initiatives to reduce costs  and the flexibility of our decentralized business model  which allows us to adjust and adapt to market conditions 
during  our cash and short term investment balance increased million  even after using million for stock repurchases and shareholder dividends 
at december   our balance sheet reflected million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  no debt  and shareholders equity of million 
in  we generated million in cash flow from operations and used million for net capital expenditures 
our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
see off balance sheet transactions below for a description of our off balance sheet transactions 
trends and outlook at year end  we had decreased our fleet by tractors versus year end in this challenging environment  we will manage our fleet size carefully and consider internal growth or contraction of our tractor fleet as events unfold 
in the near term  we expect revenue growth to come primarily from our brokerage business 
in addition  we have ramped up our efforts to identify acquisitions or other investment opportunities that may offer a strategic advantage 
over the long term  we are optimistic about our competitive position in the industry and expect that proper execution of our decentralized growth model will position us to emerge from the downturn with the ability to add more capacity and gain more market share 
further  because of our brokerage business  we are able to add customers without adding tractor capacity 
beyond the immediate challenges that many carriers face  the issues of safety  security  and environmental restrictions are becoming increasingly stringent and costly 
we think all of these factors set the stage for future growth opportunities for low cost  high quality carriers that can self fund growth and serve customers on a national basis 
we believe these factors resonate with customers and can help us differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
since inception we have been profitable through multiple economic cycles 
we view these cycles as opportunities to gain market share from other competitors that do not have the financial staying power to survive the cycles 
these cycles also provide valuable experience to our managers that will help us develop the leaders to grow this business profitably 
we believe that our level of profitability  fleet renewal strategy  and use of owner operators should enable us to internally finance attractive levels of fleet growth when demand conditions improve 
conversely  during times when we choose to maintain or trim our fleet levels  as we did during  the business is capable of generating significant cash flow from operations in excess of net capital expenditures that can be used for stock repurchases  dividend payments  and as a source for future needs 
in short  we believe we have significant financial flexibility to meet the challenges and opportunities ahead of us 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of our expense items to total revenue and revenue  before fuel surcharge  for each of the three fiscal years indicated below 
fuel expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  is calculated using fuel expense  net of surcharge 
management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
total revenue including fuel surcharge revenue  before fuel surcharge operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits fuel fuel operations and maintenance operations and maintenance insurance and claims insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses communications communications depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization lease expense revenue equipment lease expense revenue equipment purchased transportation purchased transportation miscellaneous operating expenses miscellaneous operating expenses total operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations income from operations net interest and other income net interest and other income income before income taxes income before income taxes income taxes income taxes net income net income there are minor rounding differences in the table 
gross fuel expense without fuel surcharge 
net fuel expense including fuel surcharge 
a discussion of our results of operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe our relatively high variable costs as a percentage of revenue makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to million for  from million in the operating environment in was challenging and reflected broad based economic weakness across all industries 
price competition remained intense as carriers struggled to maintain equipment productivity 
typical seasonal shipping patterns did not hold as volumes were uncharacteristically weak toward the second half of the year 
as a result of excess capacity  our average miles per tractor decreased in combined with a improvement in average revenue per total mile  our average revenue per tractor per week decreased slightly to  per tractor in  from  per tractor in our non paid empty mile percent improved basis points  to in  from in we ended with  tractors  a decrease of tractors from a year ago 
salaries  wages and benefits expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to in from in the increase is due to the combination of higher workers compensation costs and an increase in the percentage of our company fleet being operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
at december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to at december  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in  from in after reaching unprecedented record high fuel prices during most of  the fourth quarter provided some relief with falling fuel prices 
our fuel costs in decreased due to falling diesel prices combined with internal initiatives to improve fuel efficiency 
these initiatives enabled us to reduce idle times  reduce non revenue miles  improve driver fuel productivity  and control out of route miles 
we also maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   our fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in the increase is mainly attributable to the fact that a higher percentage of our fleet was operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors  during the period 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for during the year we saw meaningful benefits from continued improvement in insurance and claims expense 
over the last months we have implemented the smith systems training throughout our service centers 
smith systems is the leader in professional driver training with hands on  behind the wheel  instructional training 
we believe such training and other management efforts have been instrumental factors in reducing the severity and frequency of accidents 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at for and communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to in  from in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from in the increase is due to a higher percentage of our fleet being operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors  and a reduction in our leased revenue equipment in favor of owned revenue equipment 
lease expense for revenue equipment was near zero in  compared to for the same periods in as of december   we did not have any equipment under operating leases 
purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage division  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile or per shipment basis 
purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for the year ended  from for the same period in the slight decrease is due to the combination of a decrease in the percentage of our company fleet being operated by independent contractors  and an off setting increase in payments to outside carriers for transportation services arranged by our brokerage division  which has experienced considerable growth over the last year 
at december   of our fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  excluding purchased transportation activities from our brokerage division  this expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  would have decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for gains from the sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment decreased  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding gains from sale of used equipment  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for the year ended december   compared to in the increase in this category is mainly due to a million increase in bad debt expense in as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest and other income expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for we had no outstanding debt at december  or 
table of contents income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for the increase in our effective tax rate is mainly due to a reduction in excess tax benefits related to stock based compensation 
as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the relatively high fuel cost variability makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for  up from million in the increase is primarily due to the opening of eight brokerage branches and four asset based service centers in our average tractor fleet increased to  tractors in  from  tractors in the industry wide supply of truckload equipment outpaced demand throughout  and resulted in lower equipment utilization 
declines in both revenue per mile and miles per tractor contributed to a decline in average freight revenue per tractor per week  to  per tractor in  from  per tractor in in the fourth quarter of  we reduced our tractor fleet by approximately tractors from the third quarter of we ended with  tractors  an increase of tractors from salaries  wages and benefits expense remained relatively constant as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  at in compared to in we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to in  from in the increase in fuel expense is due to the combination of rising fuel costs and fuel mileage degradation caused by the use of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel 
the us national average of diesel fuel price increased approximately per gallon in from we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
we were able to off set a portion of the rising fuel cost due to improvements in fuel surcharge revenue 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in operations and maintenance expense increased slightly as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in  from in the increase is a result of lower revenue per mile 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance of their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for the increase is mainly due to the settlement of certain claims for prior years in amounts greater than previously anticipated 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to for from for the increase is mainly due to lower revenue per mile 
communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for the reduction in communications expense is due to contractual rate changes 
depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in the increase is a result of lower revenue per mile and lower miles per tractor 
lease expense for revenue equipment  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained at for both and as of december   we had tractors under operating leases 

table of contents purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from for the increase in this expense is primarily a result of the growth of our brokerage business 
excluding purchased transportation expense from our brokerage division  this expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  would have decreased to in  compared to for as of december   our total fleet included tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  purchased transportation represents the amount that independent contractors  as well as contracted carriers for our brokerage division  are paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile basis 
miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for gains from sale of used equipment are included in miscellaneous operating expenses 
gains from sale of equipment decreased nearly  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  excluding gains from sale of used equipment  miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at for the years ended december  and as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest and other income expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to less than for in we recorded a  impairment charge relating to our investment in transportation resource partners  which reduced our net interest and other income to less than for we had no outstanding debt at december  or income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  and to a lesser extent lease financing arrangements  issuances of our common stock  and borrowings under our line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase for is mainly due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease is mainly due to a reduction in capital expenditures for revenue equipment in capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of equipment sales and trade ins  office equipment  and land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in  we spent approximately million relating to the acquisition of the roads west equipment 
excluding any acquisitions  we currently anticipate capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately to million for we expect these capital expenditures will be used primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities of approximately million for the year ended the increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to million used to repurchase  shares of our common stock in cash dividends paid in the current year also increased approximately million  due to an increase in dividends paid to common stock shareholders 
we increased our quarterly cash dividend from per share to per share in the second quarter of at december   we had no outstanding debt 
we currently maintain a line of credit  which permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit up to an aggregate of million 
at december   the line of credit consisted solely of issued but unused letters of credit totaling million 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our line of credit agreement and were in compliance with these covenants at december  
table of contents as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments was million  compared to million as of december  despite a difficult operating environment our cash flow from operations increased million in  as compared to historically  during encouraging freight markets we have self funded our growth by purchasing equipment with the cash generated from our operations 
more recently  during the less encouraging freight market  we continued to generate a significant amount of cash which allowed us to repurchase shares  return capital to shareholders as a dividend  and position ourselves to fund possible strategic acquisitions 
we believe that we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash flows from operations and borrowing available under our existing line of credit 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of available financing  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  periodically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
at december   we had zero tractors held under operating leases  compared to tractors held under operating leases at december  vehicles held under operating leases were not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments with respect to such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item lease expense revenue equipment 
our rental expense related to revenue equipment leases was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we also use operating leases to lease locations for certain of our service centers and for temporary trailer storage 
these operating leases have termination dates ranging from january through rental payments for such facilities and trailer storage are reflected in our consolidated statements of income in the line item miscellaneous operating expenses 
rental payments for our facilities and trailer storage was million for the year ended december   and million for the years ended december  and tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short and long term operating expenses and other commitments 
payments in thousands due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other purchase obligations revenue equipment investment in transportation resource partners trp iii investment in transportation resource partners trp operating leases communication equipment operating leases buildings fin obligations  including interest and penalties total our purchase commitments for revenue equipment are currently under negotiation 
upon execution of the purchase commitments  we anticipate that purchase commitments under contract will have a net purchase price of approximately million and will be paid throughout fin obligations represent potential liabilities relating to uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalty 
we are uncertain when this liability will be settled 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consulting with experts  and using other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which ranges from two to years  down to an estimated salvage value of the property and equipment  which ranges from to of the capitalized cost 
we periodically review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used revenue equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
on october   we increased the estimated salvage value of our tractors and trailers from to 
we both routinely and periodically review and make a determination whether the salvage value of our tractors and trailers is higher or lower than originally expected 
this determination is based upon i market conditions in equipment sales  ii the guaranteed repurchase price with contracted dealerships  and iii the average miles driven on the equipment being sold 
future changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates  or fluctuation in market value that is not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect in our results of operations 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present that indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  we assess the recoverability of the assets by determining whether the carrying value of the assets will be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
in the event that such expected undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  we will adjust the property and equipment to the fair value and recognize any impairment loss 
our assets classified as held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or net selling value 
claims accrual 
reserves and estimates for claims is another of our critical accounting policies 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves are adjusted quarterly and represent accruals for the estimated self insured portion of pending claims  including adverse development of known claims  as well as incurred but not reported claims 
our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of the claim  historical trends  advice from third party administrators and insurers  the specific facts of individual cases  the jurisdictions involved  estimates of future claims development  and the legal and other costs to settle or defend the claims 
we have significant exposure to fluctuations in the number and severity of claims 
if there is an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  or we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts if the claims prove to be more severe than originally assessed  or any of the claims would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  our profitability would be adversely affected 
in addition to estimates within our self insured retention  we also must make judgments concerning our coverage limits 
if any claim was to exceed our coverage limits  we would have to accrue for the excess amount 
our critical estimates include evaluating whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
currently  we are not aware of any such claims 
if one or more claims were to exceed our effective coverage limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
accounting for income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  as amended 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 

table of contents management judgment also is required regarding a variety of other factors  including  the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences based on our future performance  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities  our likelihood of success 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and in determining the likely range of defense and settlement costs  and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  further information related to the implementation is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
share based payments 
we have stock options outstanding under our stock compensation plan 
exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed ten years from the date of the grant 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options  which generally ranges between five to seven years 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
management judgment is required to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model and management bases such decisions on historical data 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding 
new accounting pronouncements see note for discussion of new accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number and sec rules and regulations  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or trading 
because our operations are confined mostly to the united states  we are not subject to a material foreign currency risk 

table of contents interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our line of credit or incur debt 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
at december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition only if we incur substantial indebtedness and the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
we believe that the majority of the fuel price increases are generally passed to our customers
