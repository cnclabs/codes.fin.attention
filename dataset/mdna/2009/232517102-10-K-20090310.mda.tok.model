item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three years ended december  general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly  semiconductor dram memory  and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets  where we sell products both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been very cyclical  with periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
our results were favorably impacted in and as the worldwide demand for cell phones  laptops and other consumer electronics remained strong  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules  and thereby increasing demand for our electronic assembly and semiconductor products 
after peaking in the third quarter of  our revenue declined sequentially each quarter throughout  as our results were negatively impacted by reduced levels of capital spending for electronics manufacturing capacity brought about by the deepening weakness in the global economy 
new orders dropped off particularly sharply late in the fourth quarter of as the global economy fell into a severe recession 
reflecting the impact of the weakening economy  our consolidated revenues decreased by in from levels to million 
the decline in revenue was the principle reason for our operating loss of million 
we also continued to experience pricing pressure for our products  particularly our smt system products 
in addition to the drop in revenue and pricing pressure  several significant charges and strategic investments also contributed to our operating loss  including the following in february  we announced plans to move a significant portion of our systems related product development and manufacturing for all system products to singapore  the location of our asian sales office 
the transition of systems related product development to singapore was substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter of we anticipate that the transition of manufacturing for our system products will be complete by the middle of we estimate that the transition to singapore increased our expenses by approximately million 
transition costs in are not expected to be significant 
the weakness in the united states capital markets caused by the deepening global recession  as well as our reduced level of profitability  caused a significant drop in our market capitalization  resulting in a million non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of we presently anticipate that significant weakness in our markets and the global economy will continue  at least through the first half of in addition to the impact of global economic conditions on our sales  we have determined not to pursue new alignment products for use with future generations of equipment being developed by assembleon 
sales of alignment products to assembleon constituted of revenue in assembleon has informed us that they currently plan to start transitioning away from our alignment products in the third quarter of  with the transition continuing into the second quarter of the timing of assembleon s transition away from our sensor products  combined with the sharp drop off in orders in the fourth quarter of and our expectation for continued weakness into  resulted in a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter of in response to the significant weakness in our markets and the global economy  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees or in november  resulting in a  severance charge in the fourth quarter of further cost savings measures were implemented in february  including additional workforce and salary reductions  consolidation of manufacturing operations for our semi conductor products into our minneapolis minnesota facility and reductions in spending for non labor costs such as travel  supplies and the like 
from the start of the fourth quarter of through the end of the second quarter of  we will have reduced our workforce by employees or approximately  resulting from the move to singapore  relocation of manufacturing for our semiconductor operations  and the november and february workforce reductions 

table of contents during  we invested heavily in our next generation solder past inspection system which we expect to introduce in the second quarter of to be manufactured in singapore and based on a new cost reduced platform  we believe this machine will be the fastest and most accurate solder paste inspection system available and that it will strengthen our competitive position in the inspection market 
during we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million 
our balance sheet remains strong and we are well positioned financially 
we have no debt and our cash and marketable securities of million at december  are more than adequate to fund our operations and various growth opportunities for an extended period of time  even given our expectation for weak financial results through at least the first half of  due to the severe global economic recession 
we continue to pursue several promising r d initiatives for our inspection technology 
our efforts related to these projects are aimed at lowering the cost of inspection  while providing faster production through put speeds  better ease of use  and improved resolution for inspecting progressively smaller electronic components 
segment results our business consists of two operating segments  the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments 
the electronic assembly segment designs  manufactures and sells optical process control sensors and inspection systems for the electronic assembly equipment market 
the semiconductor segment designs  manufactures and sells optical and other process control sensors and related equipment for the semiconductor capital equipment market 
segment information follows year ended december  in thousands revenue electronic assembly semiconductor total gross margin electronic assembly semiconductor total operating expense electronic assembly semiconductor total income loss from operations electronic assembly semiconductor total income loss from operations interest income and other income loss before income taxes 
table of contents revenues our revenues decreased by to million in from million in and increased by in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands electronic assembly oem sensors smt systems total electronic assembly semiconductor total electronic assembly revenue from our electronic assembly sensors was down million or in compared to due to the negative impact of reduced levels of capital spending for electronics manufacturing capacity brought about by the weak global economy 
revenues from our electronic assembly sensors were down approximately  or in compared to and increased million or in compared to during and  revenue from electronic assembly sensors were positively impacted by favorable worldwide demand for cell phones  laptops and other consumer electronics  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules 
in addition  the economies in the countries where most of our products are sold remained strong 
in addition to the impact of the economic recession  which has caused orders of our sensors to drop significantly  our decision not to develop sensors for the next generation of equipment for assembleon will adversely effect our sensor revenue in future periods 
revenues from our smt systems products decreased by million or in  after increasing million or in and increasing million or in revenue from our smt system products was negatively impacted by the deepening global recession in  after being positively impacted during and by favorable worldwide demand for electronics and favorable market conditions in the countries where most of our products are sold 
unlike our sensor revenue  which is closely tied to the need for added production capacity for printed circuit boards  a portion of our smt systems revenue is derived from the retro fit of existing production lines as companies seek to improve their production yields  thereby reducing manufacturing costs 
we believe that increased use of outsourcing for circuit board assembly  production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes  increased production speeds and increased cost pressure on companies manufacturing circuit boards caused increased demand for our inspection equipment  prior to the recent global economic recession 
however  our revenue has been impacted by increasing competition and price pressure on our smt inspection systems  particularly in asia 
revenue from our systems products is impacted by the timing of the introduction of new system products  including our flex ultra and our flex ultra hr automated optical inspection aoi systems 
sales of our flex aoi systems remained virtually unchanged in at million  after increasing  or in and increasing million or in sales of our se ultra solder paste inspection system decreased million or in  after increasing million or in and increasing million or in we believe that the introduction of our next generation solder paste inspection system in the second quarter of  with its improved speed and other new capabilities will strengthen our competitive position in the inspection market 
export revenue from electronic assembly sensors and smt systems totaled million in  million in  and million in  comprising of electronic assembly revenue in  of electronic assembly revenue in  and of electronic assembly revenue in sales to international customers continue to be significant  as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  particularly to china and other areas of asia 
we believe the market trend toward automated inspection using smt inspection systems is continuing to grow and emerge due to ongoing miniaturization of smt circuit board components 
required for downsizing products  some new generation components have become so small that it is now virtually impossible for the human eye to inspect circuit boards for defects in solder paste quality  component placement and solder joints 
for this reason  we believe automated inspection has become the only viable means for inspecting smt circuit boards with such tiny components  and we believe that our smt systems products will be one of our primary growth drivers over the next few years 
we presently anticipate that significant weakness in our markets and the global economy will have a negative impact on our sales  at least through the first half of 
table of contents semiconductor revenues from semiconductor products decreased by  or in compared to and decreased by  or in compared to the decrease in revenue for both years was due to difficult conditions in the market for semiconductor fabrication equipment and declining revenue from our older wafer mapper and frame grabber products  partially offset by additional revenue from our new wafersense family of products 
total wafersense revenue increased to million in from million in and  in our wafer mapping and frame grabber products are relatively mature 
we anticipate that future growth in our semiconductor revenues  exclusive of changes related to capital procurement cycles  will come from our new wafersense products 
wafersense is a family of wireless  wafer like precision measurement tools for in situ setup  calibration and process optimization in semiconductor processing equipment 
we have recently introduced several new additions to the wafersense product line  including additional leveling sensors  along with new gapping  teaching and vibration sensors 
export revenue from semiconductor products totaled million or of total semiconductor revenue in  million or of total semiconductor revenue in and million or of total semiconductor revenue in the level of international sales and percentage of sales coming from international markets increased substantially in due to the large increase in wafersense sales  which have a higher concentration of international sales that our other semiconductor products 
in addition  sales of our wafer mapping products  which do not generate significant international sales  declined more in than our frame grabber products  which do generate significant international sales 
gross margin electronic assembly gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales were in  in and in significantly lower sales of higher margin electronic assembly sensors accounted for most of the decrease in gross margin percentage in other factors having a negative impact on our gross margin for included juki s transition to our next generation lnc sensor  which carries a lower gross margin than the older sensors we sell to juki and increasing price competition for our smt system products 
in addition  our gross margin in was negatively impacted by a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory gross margin reduction 
as discussed earlier  assembleon intends to start their transition away from our sensor products in the third quarter of the timing of assembleon s transition away from our sensor products  combined with the sharp drop off in orders in the fourth quarter of and our expectation for continued weakness into  resulted in a  charge for excess and obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter of the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in compared to was due to increasing competition resulting in lower sales prices for our electronic assembly products  particularly our smt system products 
increased competition and resulting price pressure on our smt system products reduced gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales in by four percentage points  offset in part by a one percentage point improvement from cost reduction programs 
increasing price competition for our electronic assembly sensor products also impacted our gross margin 
the gross margin decrease in resulting from the increase in price competition was partially offset by a  benefit from a warranty recovery 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales is generally lower for our system products as compared to our sensor products 
the market for automated inspection has become increasingly competitive  causing us to decrease the selling prices of our products in some markets 
with respect to our systems products  we anticipate that pricing pressures will continue in due to the competitive nature of the marketplace for all forms of automated circuit board inspection  the severe global economic recession may also have a further negative impact on pricing  as some competitors may be inclined to discount their prices in order to deal with excess inventory levels 
we have implemented our own cost reduction programs to reduce the impact of these pricing pressures on our gross margins 
we expect to introduce our next generation solder paste inspection system  as scheduled  in the second quarter of to be manufactured in singapore and based on a new cost reduced platform  we believe it will be the fastest and most accurate solder paste inspection system available on the market 
we believe this system will have capabilities not available on our current se  thus strengthening our competitive position in the inspection market 
other new systems platforms we expect to introduce in the future will be based on new technology that will allow for reduced cost and improvement in margins 
in response to significant weakness in our markets resulting from the global recession  and transition of manufacturing for our smt system products to singapore  we will have reduced our manufacturing workforce by over employees or by the end of the second quarter of we anticipate that transition of manufacturing for our smt system products to singapore will be complete by the middle of we will also consolidate manufacturing for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis minnesota headquarters facility 
these actions will allow us to reduce our overall manufacturing costs and better leverage our manufacturing operations  thereby favorably impacting our gross margins not only in the second half of  but also in future periods 
we estimate savings by the middle of from our factory cost reduction actions and transition to singapore of approximately million per year 

table of contents semiconductor gross margin as a percentage of sales were in  in and in gross margin as a percentage of sales for the semiconductor segment is dependent on revenue mix and the level of production volume over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
gross margins decreased as a percentage of revenue in and due to a change in revenue mix  with our highest margin wafer mapping sensors representing a smaller percentage of total semiconductor revenue 
we currently expect gross margins as a percentage of revenue from our semiconductor products to remain consistent or increase slightly in from levels  due to anticipated revenue from new wafersense product introductions as these products have higher gross margins than our existing products 
the consolidation of manufacturing for our semiconductor products into our minneapolis minnesota headquarters facility will also have a favorable impact on semiconductor gross margins 
operating expenses we believe continued investment in research and development of new products  coupled with continued investment in and development of our sales channel is critical to future growth and profitability 
we maintain research and development and sales and marketing expenses at relatively high levels  even during periods of downturn in our electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets  as we continue to fund development of important new products  and continue to invest in our sales channels and develop new sales territories 
in february  we announced plans to move a significant portion of our systems related product development and manufacturing for all system products to singapore  the location of our asian sales office 
the transition of systems related product development to singapore was substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter of we anticipate that the transition of manufacturing for our system products will be complete by the middle of these moves will allow us to become more responsive to the needs of our growing base of asian smt systems customers  permit our core minneapolis based optical engineering resources to work on future oem opportunities  and attain significant cost savings 
we estimate that the transition to singapore increased our expenses by approximately million 
transition costs in are not expected to be significant 
in response to the significant weakness in our markets and the global economy  and also due to our transition of a significant portion of our operations to singapore  we will have reduced our workforce by employees or over in manufacturing and approximately in development  sales and marketing from the start of the fourth quarter of through the end of the second quarter of other cost saving measures include salary reductions of for all officer and internal director level positions  for other employees with salaries exceeding  and a smaller percentage reduction for employees with salaries ranging between  and  in addition  we will also reduce spending for non labor costs such as travel  supplies and the like 
we anticipate that the workforce reductions  salary reductions and other cost saving measures  combined with savings from our transition to singapore will provide annual operating expense savings by the middle of of almost million per year 
these savings are in addition to the million of annual factory cost reductions noted above 
we are continually evaluating existing and new research and development projects  and may elect to increase or decrease expenditures based on an assessment of the future revenue and profit potential of these projects 
electronic assembly research and development expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in research and development expense in compared to resulted from costs incurred to transition our systems related research and development to singapore 
throughout most of  we maintained our minneapolis based systems development team while we trained our new singapore based team  resulting in extra costs for wages  training  travel  and other costs  during the initial start up and training period 
singapore transition costs totaled million in of this amount  transition costs included in research and development expense totaled  the increase in research and development expense in compared to was due to increased costs for contract labor of million  excluding customer funded expenses   for employee compensation associated with annual wage increases and new employees  and  for proto type expenses and lab supplies 
a significant portion of our product development efforts in were targeted at next generation smt inspection system products and continued enhancements to our se ultra solder paste inspection system and flex ultra and flex ultra hr automated optical inspection systems 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for our electronic assembly segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the slight decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to a  reduction in wage expense resulting from reduced incentive and stock compensation costs and a  reduction in commissions for third party sales representatives resulting from the lower level of system sales 
selling general and administrative expense in included approximately  of expense related to a canceled acquisition 
the savings from this non recurring activity were partially offset by additional expense related to our singapore transition 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to a  increase in sales commissions to distributors and other third parties and an approximate  increase in travel 
we also incurred approximately  of expenses in from a cancelled acquisition 
the remaining increase in selling  general and administrative expense for was due to the increase in smt system sales in compared to semiconductor research and development expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in research and development expenses for semiconductor have remained relatively constant during the last three years  as we have continued to develop various new sensors for our wafersense family of precision measurement tools  including new automated leveling  gapping  teaching and vibration sensors to assist with process optimization and yield improvement in the semiconductor fabrication process 
selling  general and administrative expenses for our semiconductor segment were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense for both and was due to a small workforce reduction which occurred early in  and lower costs for incentive compensation 
severance  recruitment and singapore transition we started to incur severance costs in february in connection with our decision to move a significant portion of development and manufacturing for our systems products to singapore 
the transition of development was substantially complete by the fourth quarter of  and transition of manufacturing is expected to be complete by the middle of severance costs incurred in in connection with the february decision totaled  we also incurred expenses totaling  for outside service providers to assist us with recruitment of our new singapore based development and manufacturing team 
we maintained our minneapolis based systems development team while we trained our new singapore based team  resulting in extra costs totaling  for wages  training  travel  and other costs  during the initial start up and training period 
these costs have been classified in our statement of operations as research and development expense 
other start up costs totaling  have been classified in our statement of operations as selling  general and administrative expense 
singapore transition costs totaled approximately million in transition costs in are not expected to be significant 
additional severance costs of  were incurred in november when we reduced our workforce by approximately or employees in response to the weak global economic conditions 
all of the aforementioned costs related to the november workforce reduction have been classified as severance and recruitment in our statement of operations 
a summary of our severance and recruitment accruals follows electronic assembly semi conductor in thousands february singapore move recruitment november workforce reduction total november workforce reduction total balance  january  costs incurred payments made balance  december  
table of contents in february  we further reduced our workforce by positions in response to weakening conditions in the global economy and our decision to consolidate manufacturing for our semiconductor products in our minneapolis facility 
we anticipate that all of these employees will have departed by the end of the second quarter of severance expense related to these actions of approximately  is expected in the first half of goodwill impairment and amortization of intangibles we assess our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for  our annual impairment review coincided with a series of facts and circumstances indicating that our goodwill might be impaired  including weakness in the united states capital markets  caused by the deepening global recession  as well as our reduced level of profitability  causing a significant drop in our market capitalization 
we measure for potential impairment of goodwill associated with each of our reporting units based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
upon completion of our analysis  we concluded that the goodwill related to our electronic assembly segment was fully impaired  resulting in a million pre tax impairment charge 
we also concluded that the goodwill related to semiconductor segment in the amount of  was not impaired 
no change in the amount of amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets for either our electronic assembly or semiconductor segments is expected in interest income and other interest income and other includes interest earned on investments  realized gains and losses from sales of investments  gains and losses associated with foreign current transactions and in  an unrealized loss on an available for sale equity security 
interest income and other decreased in compared to due to lower rates of interest earned on invested funds and lower invested balances of cash and marketable securities resulting from significant repurchases of our common stock in totaling million 
we recognized a  unrealized loss on an available for sale equity security in the second quarter of the decline in market value for this security was determined to be other than temporary resulting in recognition of the unrealized loss in our statement of operations 
we also incurred net uk sterling related foreign currency losses of  in  compared to net uk sterling related foreign currency gains of  in interest income and other increased during and as the result of additional invested funds and higher rates of interest earned on those funds 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in  reflecting an effective income tax rate of  compared to an effective income tax rate of in and in our effective income tax rate for was negatively impacted by due to the non deductibility of a large portion of our goodwill impairment charge 
a reduction in our reserve for income tax exposures reduced our effective rate by approximately in our effective rate was higher in due to an increase in our reserve for income tax exposures 
our effective tax rate was higher in compared to due to elimination of the extra territorial income exclusion in and an approximate  income tax benefit recorded in from favorable resolution of a tax contingency accrual for prior year s income taxes  resulting from the closing of a domestic statute of limitations 
our federal income tax return is currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential payments that may result from this audit 

table of contents we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals  research and development tax credit carry forwards and foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes  or when net operating loss carry forwards are applied against future taxable income  or when tax credit carry forwards are applied against future tax liabilities 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forwards periods  our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
our analysis of the need for valuation allowances considered that we have positive cumulative profit over the past three years even without the exclusion of the million non deductible goodwill impairment in we also considered the forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives 
we further evaluated our past cycles which tend to average five years in length from peak to trough and also considered our five year cumulative results ended december  which also had strong profits 
finally  we evaluated where these cumulative three and five year measures might be at the end of and considered other positive evidence to conclude no incremental valuation allowance was needed at december  while we have a recent history of profits  our results have been impacted by the recent global economic slowdown  and we incurred a loss in the united states in where most of our net deferred tax assets are recorded 
therefore  achievement of profitability in the united states will be a significant factor in determining our continuing ability to carry these deferred tax assets without recording a valuation allowance 
if future results from our operations are less than projected  a valuation allowance may be required to reduce the deferred tax assets 
if we continue to incur losses for several more quarters  and if our operations and outlook show no sign of improvement by as early as the second quarter of  we may be required to record as much as a full valuation allowance against virtually all of our deferred tax assets  which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during primarily because of repurchases of million of common stock  and purchases of million of capital assets  partly offset by million of maturities and sales of marketable securities  net of purchases   of cash generated from operating activities and  of cash received from the exercise of stock options and share purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities  and investment of cash balances in marketable securities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
combined balances of cash and marketable securities declined by million to million as of december  from million as of december  we generated  of cash from operations in cash generated from operations included our net loss of million  which included a million non cash goodwill impairment charge and other non cash expenses totaling million for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence and doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  non cash gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  gain and loss activity from marketable securities and stock compensation expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities include a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
cash generated from the reduction in accounts receivable was mostly offset by an increase in inventories of  an increase in other current assets of million  a decrease in accounts payable of  and decreases in accrued expenses and advance customer payments of  the reduction in accounts receivable and the increase in inventory resulted from the significant and rapid decline in our sales during the later half of we recorded revenue of million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the fourth quarter of the increase in other current assets reflects the anticipated tax refund we expect to receive from the carry back of our taxable loss to earlier years 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted from a reduction in new inventory purchases late in the year  in anticipation of the current global economic recession and its impact on near term sales in the decrease in accrued expenses and advance customer payments primarily resulted from the elimination of incentive bonuses in given our financial performance 

table of contents we generated million of cash from operations during cash generated from operations included net income of million  which included million of net non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence  doubtful accounts and deferred taxes  foreign currency transactions and stock compensation expense 
changes in operating assets and liabilities included a decrease in accounts receivable of  and an increase in advance customer payments of  this cash generated was offset partly by increases in inventory of million and other assets of  and a decrease in accounts payable of  the decrease in accounts receivable was due to a heightened emphasis on collections during the fourth quarter of the increase in advance customer payments is due to more sales to customers who pay prior to recognition of revenue 
inventories were up due to a shift in the mix of products sold compared to our original sales forecast 
other assets were higher because of more value added and income tax refunds due from various governmental authorities 
the decrease in accounts payable is the result of the timing of inventory purchases 
inventory purchases were down in the fourth quarter of compared to  resulting in a reduction in the accounts payable balance  as payments for inventory exceeded new purchases 
we generated million of cash from investing activities in compared to using million of cash for investing activities in changes in the level of investment in marketable securities  resulting from the purchases  sales and maturities of those securities provided million of cash in and used million of cash in we used million of cash in and million of cash in for the purchase of fixed asset and capitalized patent costs 
we used million of cash for financing activities in  compared to  of cash for financing activities in we spent million in to repurchase million shares of our common stock 
cash spent for share repurchases totaled million in there are currently no share repurchase authorizations in effect 
stock option exercises and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan generated  of cash in compared to  of cash in at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
except for our obligations under facilities leases and purchase contracts  we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million at december  we believe that on hand cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed below 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december  in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations reserve for income taxes under fin total contractual cash obligations we lease a  square foot mixed office and warehouse facility built to our specifications in golden valley  minnesota  which functions as our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility 
the lease for this space is set to expire in june during  we entered into a new three year lease for a mixed office and warehouse facility in singapore 
the lease provides for a year term from may   annual rent of approximately  and a two year renewal option 
purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis

fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances  and was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the fasb has provided a one year deferral for certain non financial assets and liabilities 
we adopted sfas no 
 effective january   for all financial assets and liabilities that were not deferred 
the adoption of sfas no 
for our financial assets and liabilities had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition when fully adopted in in accordance with sfas no 
 we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities based on a three level fair value hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 
the next highest priority is based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets or other observable inputs level 
the lowest priority is given to unobservable inputs level

in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
this standard was effective beginning after december  we elected not to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in related party transactions we did not engage in any related party transactions during the three year period ended december  inflation and foreign currency transactions changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 

table of contents we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had one open swap agreement that was purchased on that day 
as a result  any unrealized gains or losses as of december  were inconsequential 
during the year ended december   gains from the settlement of foreign currency swap agreements totaling  partially offset non cash transaction losses on the underlying inter company balance of  we have sales offices located in the uk  singapore  and china

on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from all customers  including distributors  is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  revenues are recognized upon shipment under fob shipping point terms 
estimated returns and warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale 
sales of some surface mount technology smt products may require customer acceptance due to performance or other acceptance criteria included in the terms of sale 
for these smt product sales  revenue is recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
when a sale involves multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each respective element in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
allocation of revenue to undelivered elements of the arrangement is based on fair value of the element being sold on a stand alone basis 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components and excludes amortization of intangible assets 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider specific accounts  historical write offs  changes in customer relationships and credit worthiness and concentrations of credit risk 
specific accounts receivable are written off once a determination is made that the account is uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties is  at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of million 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill for each of our reporting units by estimating their fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology to determine a reasonable valuation 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill for impairment because facts and circumstances similar to those noted above indicated that the assets might be impaired  including weakness in the united states capital markets caused by the deepening global recession  and our reduced level of profitability  causing a significant drop in our market capitalization 
an impairment loss for our identifiable intangible and long lived assets would be recognized when future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset and eventual disposition are less than the carrying amount 
as of december   we projected our future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets and concluded that there was no impairment 

table of contents in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of our two reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying value step of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the summation of our reporting units fair values is compared and reconciled to our market capitalization as of the date of our impairment test 
in the situation where a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the measurement of the impairment step of the impairment test is calculated by determining the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
in determining the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach  our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions 
fair value on a discounted cash flow basis uses forecasts over a year period with an estimation of residual growth rates thereafter 
we use our business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
the significant assumptions incorporated in these forecasts for the most recent goodwill impairment tests include our expectations regarding revenue during the year period  a percent terminal growth rate and a discount rate for both our electronic assembly and semiconductor reporting units 
the selection of discount rates may have a significant impact on the determination of fair value 
however  for the test  an increase or decrease of one percent in the discount rate would have had no impact on the impairment recorded for our electronic assembly reporting unit 
for purposes of our goodwill impairment test  we reconciled the fair value for each of our reporting units to our overall fair value 
the publicly traded market price of our common stock and a control premium of percent was used in our determination of fair value  which represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the company 
the control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years 
while the control premium is a significant assumption in determining our overall fair value  it had a minimal impact on the determination of goodwill impairment in an increase in the assumed control premium by five percent to percent would have had no impact on the impairment recorded for our electronic assembly reporting unit 
our remaining goodwill at december   in the amount of  relates to our semiconductor reporting unit 
our recent analyses indicate that this goodwill is not impaired 
however  our conclusion could change in the future  if our assumptions about future economic conditions  revenue growth or profitability change 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in the future 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining worldwide income tax expense based upon tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we have established reserves for uncertain tax positions by applying the more likely than not criteria of fin  under which the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authority 
all tax positions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant modification  such as the completion of audits or the expiration of statutes of limitations  which may result in future charges or credits to income tax expense 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the current tax liability  as well as assessing temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for financial statement and tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals  research and development tax credit carry forwards and foreign net operating loss carry forwards 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes  or when net operating loss carry forwards are applied against future taxable income  or when tax credit carry forwards are applied against future tax liabilities 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 

table of contents significant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods  our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
our analysis of the need for valuation allowances considered that we have positive cumulative profit over the past three years even without the exclusion of the million non deductible goodwill impairment in we also considered the forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives 
we further evaluated our past cycles which tend to average five years in length from peak to trough and also considered our five year cumulative results ended december  which also had strong profits 
finally  we evaluated where these cumulative three and five year measures might be at the end of and considered other positive evidence to conclude no incremental valuation allowance was needed at december  while we have a recent history of profits  our results have been impacted by the recent global economic slowdown  and we incurred a loss in the united states in where most of our net deferred tax assets are recorded 
therefore  achievement of profitability in the united states will be a significant factor in determining our continuing ability to carry these deferred tax assets without recording a valuation allowance 
if future results from our operations are less than projected  a valuation allowance may be required to reduce the deferred tax assets 
if we continue to incur losses for several more quarters  and if our operations and outlook show no sign of improvement by as early as the second quarter of  we may be required to record as much as a full valuation allowance against virtually all of our deferred tax assets  which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  approved by our board of directors  manages the portfolio at the direction of our management 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities  various tax exempt securities or certain approved corporate instruments with effective maturities of five years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
the policy also provides for investment in certain specified marketable equity securities 
as of december  our portfolio of marketable securities had a weighted average maturity of years 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would decrease the market value of our marketable securities by approximately  if such a rate increase occurred  our net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had one open swap agreement that was purchased on that day 
as a result  any unrealized gains or losses as of december  were inconsequential 
during the year ended december   gains from the settlement of foreign currency swap agreements totaling  partially offset non cash transaction losses on the underlying inter company balance of  our foreign currency swap agreements contain credit risk to the extent that our bank counter parties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize such risk by limiting our counter parties to major financial institutions 
we do not expect material losses as a result of defaults by other parties
