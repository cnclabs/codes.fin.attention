recent regulatory events in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  on october   the billion emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was signed into law 
on october   pursuant to eesa  the us treasury announced that it would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts 
under this program  known as the troubled asset relief program capital purchase program tarp cpp  the treasury will make up to billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock  from the billion authorized by the eesa 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
participating financial institutions will be required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governances for periods during which the treasury holds equity issued under the tarp cpp 
on january   as part of the tarp cpp  we agreed to issue and sell  and the treasury agreed to purchase  shares preferred shares of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a  having a liquidation preference of  per share  and a ten year warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  par value  at an exercise price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  thousand in cash 
the preferred shares qualify as tier capital and will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum for the first five years and per annum thereafter 
dividends are payable quarterly on february  may  august and november of each year 
on february   the treasury announced an additional program to purchase equity stakes in banks and thrifts  known as the troubled asset relief program capital assistance program tarp cap 
under tarp cap  the treasury will purchase preferred stock that is convertible into common stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred investment 
companies participating in the tarp cap may also convert any preferred shares issued under the tarp cpp into convertible preferred shares under the tarp cap 
the deadline to apply to participate in the tarp cap is may  we have not decided whether to apply under the tarp cap

non interest expense for decreased by million as compared to provision expense increased by million for excluding the available for sale gains in and the other than temporary impairment and the securities losses in  non interest income decreased thousand 
the decline in net interest income is primarily a result of the rate cuts by the federal reserve that started in september consistent with our approach to control expenses  noninterest expense decreased through reductions in salaries and benefits  furniture and equipment expenses  and printing and supplies expense

as expected  our margin declined due to the easing of the federal funds target rate by the federal reserve board which reduced our yield on earning assets faster than the reduction in the rates paid on deposits 
through december   the federal reserve board has reduced the target federal funds target rate by basis points since december  and a total of basis points since september we anticipate our margin will stabilize during our margin for will be dependent on our ability to raise core deposits  our growth rate in loans  and any possible further actions by the federal reserve board 
on july   the volkswagen group of america  inc announced plans to build a billion automobile production facility in chattanooga  tennessee 
the plant will bring about  direct jobs  including approximately white collar jobs  and up to  indirect jobs to the region 
on february   wacker chemie ag announced plans to build a billion chemical plant in cleveland  tennessee 
the plant is expected to initially employ nearly people 
we believe the positive economic impact on chattanooga and the surrounding region will be significant from these new investments 
we believe these projects will help stabilize and possibly increase real estate values  as well as provide increased overall economic activity in the region 
on november   our board of directors approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation authorizing up to  shares of blank check preferred stock 
the amendment was approved by our shareholders on december  critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
critical accounting policies include the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a material impact on our financial presentation as well as accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements that require us to make estimates and assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time 
disclosure about critical estimates is required if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements operations 
accounting policies related to the allowance for loan and lease losses  fair value  and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets each represent a critical accounting estimate 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the level is based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans  current economic conditions and other factors 
our financial results are affected by the changes and absolute level of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the quarterly analysis involves complex internal and external variables  and it requires that we exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate allowance 
as a result of uncertainty associated with the subjectivity  we cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved  should we experience sizable loan or lease losses in any particular period 
for example  changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions or the various markets in which collateral may be sold could require us to significantly decrease or increase the level of the allowance 
such an adjustment could materially affect net income as a result of the change in provision for loan and lease losses 
during  we experienced considerable quarterly increases in our provision due to declining economic conditions  increases in nonperforming assets and several significant charge offs 
should any of these factors change  the estimate of credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance would also change 
refer to the provision for loan and lease losses section for a discussion of our methodology of establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses 
estimates of fair value we measure or monitor many of our assets and liabilities on a fair value basis 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
the extent to which we use fair value on a recurring basis was significantly expanded upon the adoption of sfas as of january  examples of recurring uses of fair value include available for sale securities and held for sale loans 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets and liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with sfas examples of these non recurring uses of fair value include other real estate owned  goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
depending on the nature of the asset or liability  we use various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value 
these valuation techniques and assumptions are in accordance with sfas and when applicable  fsp fas fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
estimating fair value in accordance with sfas requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
where observable market prices for identical assets or liabilities are not available  sfas requires that we identify  what we believe to be  similar assets or liabilities 
this is known as level pricing 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques  such as discounted cash flow analysis these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including market based assumptions  such as interest rates  as well as assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  and the risk of nonperformance 
in certain cases  our assessments with respect to assumptions that market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements 
this is known as level pricing 
the use of sfas is described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in estimating fair value for available for sale securities and derivative cash flow swaps  we believe that independent  third party market prices are the best evidence of exit price 
if such third party market prices are not available on the exact securities that we own  fair value is based on the market prices of similar instruments  
table of contents 
index to financial statements third party broker quotes or is estimated using industry standard or proprietary models whose inputs may be unobservable 
the fair value of held for sale loans is based on observable market prices in the secondary loan market 
the fair value of other real estate owned is typically determined based on recent appraisals by third parties  less estimated selling costs 
the fair value of repossession is typically determined based on the current pricing in the secondary market 
for both other real estate owned and repossessions  changes in economic  real estate and supply and demand conditions can significantly change the fair value 
estimates of fair value are also required when evaluating impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate fair value may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
goodwill and other intangible assets we periodically review the carrying values of intangible assets not subject to amortization  including goodwill  to determine whether an impairment exists 
statement of financial standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition 
these assets are subject to at least an annual impairment review and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence 
the impairment assessment primarily uses discounted cash flow analysis  which requires assumptions about short and long term net cash flow growth  as well as discount rates 
the assessment also uses market data  including recent  similar bank acquisition transactions 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate impairment may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
results of operations we reported net income for of million versus net income for of million and net income for of million 
in  basic net income per share was on approximately million shares and diluted net income per share was on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding 
in  basic net income per share was on approximately million shares and diluted net income per share was on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding 
in  basic net income per share was on approximately million shares and diluted net income per share was on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding 
net income in was significantly below the level predominately as a result of higher provision expense 
declining margins also resulted in lower net interest income  which was partially offset by lower overhead as a result of our efforts to control expenses 
as of december   we had banking offices  including the headquarters  three leasing loan production offices and full time equivalent employees 
although we expect to continue to expand our branch network and our employee force in  we are mindful of the fact that growth and increasing the number of branches adds expenses such as administrative costs and occupancy  salaries and benefits expenses before earnings

for  average interest earning assets increased to billion 
however  the associated increase in earnings from the higher volumes was offset by the decline in the yields of earning assets  as discussed in further details below 
the increase in interest income from to was due to increases in the volume of earning assets and a shift in the earning asset mix from investment securities and federal funds sold to our higher yielding loan portfolio 
average loans in were million  an increase of million  or 
all other earning assets were million  a decrease of thousand  or 
total average earning assets in were billion  an increase of million  or  from average earning assets 
our increase in loans year over year in was funded by the deposit gathering activities at fsgbank  the use of alternative funding through brokered deposits and the shifting mix of earning assets 

table of contents 
index to financial statements offsetting the additional earnings from increased volumes were the decreases in yield on earning assets 
the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased basis points in to from in  which was basis points higher than the reduction in yield on loans for was basis points  which was a result of the cuts in the federal fund rate 
from september to december  the federal reserve board reduced the target federal funds rate by basis points to a target rate of 
throughout the last twelve months  we had an asset sensitive balance sheet  which causes interest income to decline faster than interest expense 
the changes in the yield rates from to relate to our changing the mix of earning assets  the fourth quarter sale of approximately million of investment securities with an average yield of and the second quarter sale of approximately million of securities with an average yield of approximately 
the proceeds from the sale of the securities were used to de leverage a portion of our balance sheet by reducing our overnight borrowings  which eliminated negative spread 
total interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in interest expense for decreased due to the reduced cost of funds despite the additional volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in interest expense from to was primarily due to rising interest rates caused by competitive pressures and the increases in the target federal funds rate in  combined with the additional volume of interest bearing liabilities 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to million for comparing to  average brokered deposits increased by million  or  average other borrowings increased by million  or  and average federal funds purchased increased by million from million to million 
these increases in non core deposits were primarily used to fund our loan growth for average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in compared to the increase in is primarily due to increases in retail and in market jumbo time deposits and the use of other borrowings  including the fhlb overnight borrowings 
offsetting the additional expense from increased volumes were the decreases in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
total interest expense for declined by million as compared to increases in volume for contributed million in additional interest expense as compared to  while the decline in the rates paid reduced interest expense by million 
deposit pricing  especially for time deposits  typically lags changes in the target federal funds rate  and therefore we realized a consistent but gradual reduction in our costs of deposits throughout the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities for decreased by basis points from to 
during the first half of  overnight borrowings  including advances from the fhlb and federal funds purchased  were our primary source of funding as we decided not to replace other maturing deposits as deposit rates were continuing to decline 
overnight borrowings reprice daily  and since the federal reserve bank was decreasing target interest rates  we were able to reduce future interest expense by delaying the replacement of other maturing deposits 
during the second half of  we decided to improve our contingent funding plans and significantly reduced our overnight borrowings and replaced them with brokered deposits 
by december   we had reduced our overnight borrowings to million  which is less than the average balance for overnight borrowings 
the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to for from in our rate increases in were a reflection of the market conditions and a greater reliance on higher cost non core funding 
we expect average earnings assets for to be comparable to the levels while the average rate will continue to decline as the full impact of the reductions in the target federal fund rate will be realized for the entire year of we expect average interest bearing liabilities to be comparable with more reliance on brokered deposits and less reliance on federal funds purchased and other borrowings 
rates paid on deposits are expected to continue to decline  however  competitive pressures and our potential inability to raise core deposits  which could result in an increased use of higher cost alternative funding  may partially offset the impact of the declining rates 
net interest income net interest spread and net interest margin the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure relative profitability of net interest income net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average 
table of contents 
index to financial statements yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread does not consider the impact of noninterest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percentage of total average earning assets and takes into account the positive effects of investing noninterest bearing deposits in earning assets 
first security s net interest rate spread on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in  while the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in the decrease in the net interest spread and net interest margin for was primarily due to our rates on earning assets decreasing faster than the rates on interest bearing liabilities 
during  approximately of our loans repriced simultaneously with changes to an associated index such as prime  which is driven by the target federal funds rate  while only approximately of our liabilities repriced simultaneously 
as such  reductions by the federal reserve board to the target rate have an immediate negative impact on our net interest spread and net interest margin 
additionally  a decline in average noninterest bearing deposits for contributed to the decline in net interest margin 
for  noninterest bearing deposits contributed basis points to the net interest margin  as compared to basis points during the decrease in the net interest spread and net interest margin for was primarily due to our rates on interest bearing liabilities rising faster than the yields on earning assets 
average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earnings assets were  and for  and  respectively 
in late june  we entered into a series of cash flow swaps with a total notional value of million 
floating rate cash flow payments on a portion of our prime based variable rate loans were swapped for fixed rate payments 
we entered into the swaps to mitigate our interest rate risk in a falling interest rate environment 
on august   we terminated the swap agreements and locked in a gain of approximately million 
the gain is being accreted into interest income over the expected term of the variable rate loans hedged 
for and  the gain accreted into interest income was thousand and thousand  respectively 
the accretion for the terminated swaps is estimated to be thousand for in october  we entered into a total of million notional value cash flow swaps 
the swaps exchanged a portion of our prime based variable rate payments for fixed rate payments 
the fixed rate is appropriately and the term is five years 
for and  the active swaps added million and thousand to interest income  respectively 
based on the prime rate of at december   we estimate the active swaps to contribute an estimated million to interest income for we anticipate our net interest spread and net interest margin to stabilize during the stabilization for will be dependent on our ability to raise core deposits  our growth rate in loans  and any possible further actions by the federal reserve board 
provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations during increased million to million compared to million in and million in net charge offs totaled million for  million for and million for net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were in  in and in and our bank s peer group averages as reported in the december  uniform bank performance report were  and in  and  respectively

as a result of our analysis  we determined that our quarterly provisions for each consecutive quarter of required additional increases to the provision expense

index to financial statements during  five relationships resulted in charge offs totaling million 
the associated charge offs were thousand in the second quarter of  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
throughout  economic trends continued to decline and the us economy entered into a recession with rising unemployment and falling real estate values 
most indicators point toward the overall us economy remaining in a potentially prolonged recessionary period 
we will continue to provide provision expense to maintain an allowance level adequate to absorb known and estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio based on the most current information 
the quarterly assessments will determine the necessary provision expense and as such  we cannot estimate provision expense for our allowance for loan and lease losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance compared to a group of peer banks 
during their routine examinations  regulators may require us to make additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses when  in the opinion of the regulators  their credit evaluations and allowance for loan and lease loss methodology differ materially from ours 
during and  we made further enhancements to our methodology and analysis of the loan loss reserve and continued to implement improvements based on recent interagency regulatory guidance 
in addition to analyzing significant loans and leases  we segmented the remaining portfolio of loans and leases into similar or homogeneous pools such as purpose of proceeds  type of loan or lease or by collateral as per the regulatory guidance and the statement of financial accounting standard the actual loss history of each pool was then added to the risk assessment percentage of eight qualitative and environmental categories to determine management s best estimate for risk of loss within each pool 
our primary grouping of loans and leases within the allowance are as follows impaired loans and leases these classified loans and leases generally include those loans with a risk rating of substandard and or doubtful  are no longer accruing interest and as per sfas  have been determined to have a documented and supported impairment 
for this group  management determines the impairment amount based upon a discount of the cash flows  or observable market value or the current value of real or personal property held as collateral 
the definition of both substandard and doubtful risk ratings are outlined in item below 
remaining loans and leases the remaining loans and leases not analyzed in item above are pooled based upon loan or lease type  collateral securing the loan or risk rating and as instructed in sfas and regulatory guidance 
each of these pools is analyzed individually as homogeneous groups of loans or leases and are assigned a loss factor which is management s best estimate of the loss that potentially could be realized in that pool of loans or leases 
the loss factor is the sum of an objectively calculated historical loss percentage and a subjectively calculated risk percentage 
the actual annual historical loss factor is typically a weighted average of each period s loss 
the subjectively calculated risk percentage is the sum of eight qualitative and environmental risk categories reviewed for each pool of loans and leases 
these subjective risk categories are as follows a underlying collateral values  b lending practices and policies  c local and national economies  d portfolio volume and nature  e staff experience  f credit quality  g loan review  and h competition  regulatory and legal issues 
a 
other classified and criticized loans we reserve for the remaining criticized and classified loan and lease pools not included in item above impaired loans and leases using flat percentages based upon each pool s historical migration loss analysis or other documented loss rates  which is also adjusted for the aforementioned qualitative and environmental risk categories 
the migration analysis is a calculation of the average loss experienced over several periods within each pass  criticized and classified risk rating to produce an actual loss rate of net charge offs 
the pass ratings are assigned to those loans that are performing as contractually agreed and do not exhibit the characteristics of criticized and classified risk ratings as defined below 
these actual loss percentages are then summed with the subjective risk categories as described in item above to produce a loss factor for each pool

loans with risk ratings of special mention we generally reserve for special mention loans and leases using a historical month migration loss percentage 
the historical loss factor and the qualitative and environmental factors  as described above in item  are then applied to the appropriate pools of special mention loans and leases 
the special mention risk rating is considered a criticized loan and is not considered as severe as a classified loan risk rating 
special mention loans contain one or more potential weakness es  which if not corrected  could result in an unacceptable increase in credit risk at some future date 
these loans and leases may be characterized by loans to businesses downward trend in sales  profit levels and margins impaired working capital position compared to industry cash flow strained in order to meet debt repayment schedule technical defaults due to noncompliance with financial covenants recurring trade payable slowness high leverage compared to industry average with shrinking equity cushion questionable abilities of management weak industry conditions inadequate or outdated financial statements loans to businesses or individuals loan delinquencies and overdrafts may occur original source of repayment questionable documentation deficiencies may not be easily correctable loan may need to be restructured collateral or guarantor offers adequate protection unsecured debt to tangible net worth is excessive ii 
loans with risk ratings of substandard we generally reserve for substandard loans and leases that are not specifically identified in item using a historical month migration analysis loss rate 
the historical loss and qualitative and environmental factors  as described in item above  are then applied to the appropriate pool of substandard loans and leases 
substandard loans and leases have specifically identified weaknesses and deficiencies typically resulting from severe adverse trends of a financial  economic  or managerial nature  and may warrant non accrual status 
for substandard loans and leases  a protracted work out is likely due to the following factors  in addition to those listed for special mention loans loans to businesses sustained losses which have severely eroded equity and cash flows concentration in illiquid assets serious management problems or internal fraud chronic trade payable slowness  may be placed on cod or collection by trade creditor inability to access other funding sources

loans with risk ratings of doubtful we analyze doubtful loans and leases individually to determine our best estimate of loss based upon the most recent assessment of all available sources of repayment 
these loans are analyzed in the same manner as those loans categorized in item as impaired loans and leases 
management estimates the specific potential losses based upon an individual analysis of the relationship risks  the borrower s cash flow  the borrower s management and any underlying secondary sources of repayment 
the amount of the estimated loss  if any  is then specifically reserved in a separate component of the allowance 
doubtful loans are loans where the collection or liquidation in full of principal and or interest is highly questionable or improbable 
doubtful loans must be placed on non accrual  and the principal balance charged down to estimated collectable value  or a full or partial reserve must be allocated 
in addition to the characteristics listed for substandard loans  the following characteristics apply to doubtful loans loans to businesses normal operations are severely diminished or have ceased seriously impaired cash flow numerous exceptions to loan agreement outside accountant questions entity s survivability as a going concern financial statements may be received late  if at all material legal judgments filed collection of principal and interest is impaired collateral guarantor may offer inadequate protection loans to businesses or individuals original repayment terms materially altered secondary source of repayment is inadequate asset liquidation may be in process with all efforts directed at debt retirement documentation deficiencies not correctable

unclassified and uncriticized loans in our analysis of these loan and lease pools  we establish our reserves using the historical average net charge off over various periods for each pool of loans 
the number of periods used to determine the average net charge off amount is dependent upon the available data  but generally is no less than months 
each of these pools historical loss rates are then adjusted by the eight qualitative and environmental risk areas  as described in item above  and applied to the appropriate pools of unclassified and uncriticized loans and leases 
for purposes of analyzing the allowance for loan losses  the unclassified and uncriticized loan pools do not include the unfunded portions of binding commitments to lend  standby letters of credit  deposit secured loans or mortgage loans originated with commitments to sell in the secondary market 
loans secured by segregated deposits held by us are not required to have an allowance reserve  nor are originated mortgage loans pending sale in the secondary market 
while it is our policy to charge off in the current period loans for which a loss is recognized  there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise

the following table represents our anticipated intangible asset amortization over the next five years  excluding new acquisitions  if any 
in thousands core deposit intangible amortization expense our policy is to assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
accounting standards require us to estimate the fair value in making the assessment of impairment at least annually 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist in computing the fair value estimate for the goodwill impairment assessment 
the firm utilized two separate valuation methodologies and comparing the results of each methodology in order to determine the fair value of the goodwill associated with our prior bank acquisitions 
the valuation methodologies utilized included a discounted cash flow valuation technique and a comparison of the average price to book value of comparable bank acquisitions 
both valuations exceeded the book value of our goodwill  and thus  no impairment expense has been recorded 
a continued decline in market value and reduced estimated future earnings may lead to a goodwill impairment in

as of december   we performed an impairment assessment of the securities in our portfolio that had an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in the fair value of those securities below their cost was other than temporary 
impairment is considered other than temporary when it becomes probable that we will be unable to recover the cost of an investment 
the impairment assessment takes into consideration factors such as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including events specific to the issuer or industry  defaults or deferrals of scheduled interest  principal or dividend payments  external credit ratings and recent downgrades and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value 
if a decline is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value  which then becomes the new cost basis 
the new cost basis would not be adjusted in future periods for subsequent recoveries in fair value  if any 
the following table shows the gross unrealized losses and fair value of the our investments with unrealized losses that are not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position  at december  less than months months or greater totals fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses in thousands december  mortgage backed municipals other totals the unrealized loss position in mortgage backed securities is primarily isolated to five private label cmos

one security has a thousand  or  unrealized loss 
the loan to value on the underlying mortgages of this bond is under and the average credit score of the underlying mortgage borrowers was we believe the five cmos with unrealized losses remain high quality investment grade securities with appropriate credit quality and collateral strength 
based on results of our impairment assessment  we consider the unrealized loss at december  to be temporary 
the unrealized loss position in the municipal securities is primarily a result of rising long term interest rates and additional credit spread widening subsequent to purchase 
unrealized losses will decline as interest rates fall to the purchased yield and as the securities approach maturity 
based on results of our impairment assessment  we consider the unrealized loss at december  to be temporary 
the unrealized loss position in the other securities category is in two trust preferred security pools 
the unrealized loss is primarily a result of a decline in demand for trust preferred securities as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and widening of credit spread 
both securities are a rated by fitch and passed the stress test for credit quality and collateral strength

the liquidity of fsgbank refers to the ability or financial flexibility to adjust its future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and to fund operations on a timely and cost effective basis 
the primary sources of funds for fsgbank are cash generated by repayments of outstanding loans  interest payments on loans  and new deposits

fsgbank also used its borrowing capacity at the fhlb to purchase a million letter of credit that we pledged to the state of tennessee bank collateral pool 
the letter of credit allows us to release investment securities from the collateral pool and thus improve our liquidity ratio 
additionally  fsgbank could increase its borrowing capacity at the fhlb  subject to more stringent collateral requirements  by pledging loans other than family first mortgage and commercial real estate loans 
as of december   our unused borrowing capacity using family first mortgage and commercial real estate loans at the fhlb was million compared to million at year end in the second half of  we deliberately improved our collateralized borrowing capacity at the fhlb due to the recession and our desire to enhance our contingent funding sources 
the fhlb maintains standards for loan collateral files 
therefore  our borrowing capacity may be restricted if our collateral file has exceptions  such as expired property insurance 
fsgbank also had unsecured federal funds lines in the aggregate amount of million at december  under which it can borrow funds to meet short term liquidity needs 
the federal funds lines in use at year end totaled million 
another source of funding is loan participations sold to other commercial banks in which we retain the servicing rights 
as of year end  we had million in loan participations sold 
fsgbank may continue to sell loan participations as a source of liquidity 
we may also pledge investment securities against a line of credit at a commercial bank as an additional source of short term funding 
as of year end  we had no borrowings against our investment securities  except for repurchase agreements and public fund deposits attained in the ordinary course of business 
we utilize brokered deposits to provide an additional source of funding for loan growth

cash flows from operations in were reduced due to lower net income and a decrease in other liabilities  partially offset by an increase in provision expense 
net cash used in investing activities decreased to million in as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in can be attributed to a reduction in net loan originations and principal collections

during  we replaced our overnight borrowings and federal funds purchased with brokered deposits 
brokered deposits were our primary source of funding loan growth in capital resources banks and bank holding companies  as regulated institutions  must meet required levels of capital 
the occ and the federal reserve board  the primary federal regulators for fsgbank and first security  respectively  have adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets 
financial institutions are expected to maintain a level of capital commensurate with the risk profile assigned to their assets in accordance with the guidelines 
first security and fsgbank both maintain capital levels exceeding the minimum capital levels required in addition to exceeding those capital requirements for well capitalized banks and holding companies under applicable regulatory guidelines

an important function of the federal reserve board is to regulate the national money supply 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve board are purchases and sales of us government securities in the marketplace  changes in the discount rate  which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the federal reserve  and changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions 
these instruments are effective in influencing economic and monetary growth  interest rate levels and inflation 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
because of changing conditions in the national and international economy and in the money markets  as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities  it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates  deposit levels or loan demand or whether the changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings 
the fdic s initiative to increase the deposit insurance fund through increased recurring fdic insurance assessments as well as an additional one time assessment for as of june  will have a significant negative impact on the financial results of all banks 
legislation is from time to time introduced in the united states congress and the tennessee general assembly and other state legislatures  and regulations are proposed by the regulatory agencies that could affect our business 
it cannot be predicted whether or in what form any of these proposals will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected thereby 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
such commitments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments 
we follow the same credit policies in making commitments as we do for on balance sheet instruments

commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

fsp fas clarifies the application of sfas no 
in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp fas was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
we applied the guidance in fsp fas in its fair value measurements as of september  and the effects of adoption were not material to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures related to derivatives accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
and reconsiders existing disclosure requirements for such derivatives and any related hedging items 
the disclosures provided in sfas will be required for both interim and annual reporting periods 
sfas is effective prospectively for quarterly interim periods beginning after november  we are currently assessing the effects of adopting sfas in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations  which revises sfas no 
and changes multiple aspects of the accounting for business combinations 
under the guidance in sfas r  the acquisition method must be used  which requires the acquirer to recognize most identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at their full fair value on the acquisition date 
goodwill is to be recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the noncontrolling interest over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are to be recognized in earnings  while contingent consideration classified as equity is not to be remeasured 
cost such as transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting  generally leading to recognizing expense and additionally  restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as post acquisition costs 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact that this issuance will have on our consolidated financial statements  however  we anticipate that the standard will lead to more volatility in the results of operations during the periods subsequent to an acquisition

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
the statement allows an irrevocable election to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis  
table of contents 
index to financial statements with unrealized gains and losses recognized currently in earnings 
under sfas  the fair value option may only be elected at the time of initial recognition of a financial asset or financial liability or upon the occurrence of certain specified events 
additionally  sfas provides that application of the fair value option must be based on the fair value of an entire financial asset or financial liability and not selected risks inherent in those assets or liabilities 
sfas requires that assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value pursuant to the fair value option be reported in the financial statements in a manner that separates those fair values from the carrying amounts of similar assets and liabilities which are measured using another measurement attribute 
sfas also provides expanded disclosure requirements regarding the effects of electing the fair value option on the financial statements 
sfas is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted for fiscal years in which interim financial statements have not been issued  provided that all of the provisions of sfas are early adopted as well 
we early adopted sfas effective january  note of our consolidated financial statements provides further information

the expanded disclosures include the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value on earnings and is applicable whenever other standards require or permit assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted

the fsp also addresses accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment on a debt security  and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the fsp replaces the impairment guidance on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
with references to existing authoritative literature concerning other than temporary determinations 
under the fsp  losses arising from impairment deemed to be other than temporary  must be recognized in earnings at an amount equal to the entire difference between the security s cost and its fair value at the financial statement date  without considering partial recoveries subsequent to that date 
the fsp also required that an investor recognize an other than temporary impairment loss when a decision to sell a security has been made and the investor does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of sale 
the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
if it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of the change to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be adopted prospectively 
for new accounting pronouncements  the transition guidance in the pronouncement should be followed 
retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used 
sfas did not change the guidance for reporting corrections of errors  changes in estimates or for justification of a change in accounting principle on the basis of preferability

sfas r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
for public entities that do not file as small business issuers  sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the adoption of sfas r resulted in compensation expense recorded to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk  with respect to first security  is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the risk of loss can result in either lower fair market values or reduced net interest income 
we manage several types of risk  such as credit  liquidity and interest rate 
we consider interest rate risk to be a significant risk that could potentially have a large material effect on our financial condition 
further  we process hypothetical scenarios whereby we shock our balance sheet up and down for possible interest rate changes  we analyze the potential change positive or negative to net interest income  as well as the effect of changes in fair market values of assets and liabilities 
we do not deal in international instruments  and therefore are not exposed to the risks inherent to foreign currency 
additionally  as of december   we had no trading assets that exposed us to the risks in market changes 
our interest rate risk management is the responsibility of our board of directors asset liability committee alco 
the committee has established policies and limits for management to monitor  measure and coordinate our sources  uses  and pricing of funds 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense associated with our interest sensitive assets and liabilities also change  thereby impacting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
alco utilizes the results of both a static and dynamic gap report  as well as an income simulation report  to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to a sustained change in interest rates 
we monitor and forecast potential interest rate changes based on market data 
in a falling interest rate environment  we closely monitor our funding sources and pricing to minimize the impact to our net interest margin for our asset sensitive balance sheet 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the gap analysis projects net interest income based on both a rise and fall in interest rates of basis points ie over a twelve month period 
the model is based on actual repricing dates of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets 
we measure this exposure based on an immediate change in interest rates of basis points up or down 
given this scenario  we had  at year end  an exposure to falling rates and a benefit from rising rates 
more specifically  the model forecasts a decline in net interest income of million or  as a result of a basis point decline in rates 
the model also predicts a million increase in net interest income  or  as a result of a basis point increase in rates 
the forecasted results of the model are within the limits specified by our guidelines 
the following chart reflects first security s sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  the model is based on a static balance sheet and assumes that paydowns and maturities of both assets and liabilities are reinvested in similar instruments at current interest rates  rates down basis points  and rates up basis points 
interest rate risk income sensitivity summary down bp current up bp dollar amounts in thousands net interest income change net interest income change net interest income the preceding sensitivity analysis is a modeling analysis  which changes periodically and consists of hypothetical estimates based upon numerous assumptions including interest rate levels  shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  rates on loans and deposits  reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments and deposits  and other assumptions 
in addition  there is no input for growth or a change in asset mix 
while assumptions are developed based on the current economic and market conditions  management cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ 
also  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
we use the sendero vision asset liability system which is a comprehensive interest rate risk measurement tool that is widely used in the banking industry 
generally  it provides the user with the ability to more accurately model both static and dynamic gap  economic value of equity  duration  and income simulations using a wide range of scenarios including interest rate shocks and rate ramps 
the system also has the capability to model derivative instruments  such as interest rate swap contracts
