overview we are a biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of monoclonal  antibody based products for the targeted treatment of cancer  autoimmune and other serious diseases 
we have developed a number of advanced proprietary technologies that allow us to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled  or naked  form  or conjugated with radioactive isotopes  chemotherapeutics or toxins  in each case to create highly targeted agents 
using these technologies  we have built a broad pipeline of therapeutic product candidates that utilize several different mechanisms of action 
we believe that our portfolio of intellectual property  which includes approximately issued patents in the us and more than other issued patents worldwide  protects our product candidates and technologies 
we have continued to transition our focus away from the development and commercialization of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates  although we manufacture and commercialize our leukoscan product in territories where regulatory approvals have previously been granted 
leukoscan is indicated for diagnostic imaging for determining the location and extent of infection inflammation in bone in patients with suspected osteomyelitis  including patients with diabetic foot ulcers 
from inception in through june  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million with fiscal year the first year to have reported net income 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we continue to conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  or fda  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic products outside of our control 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
we account for revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple arrangements  or eitf eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying the guidance  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables can only be considered as separate units of accounting if a the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items and c if the right of return exists  delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
if these criteria are not met  the revenue elements must be considered a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
we concluded that the license and collaboration agreement dated july   or the nycomed agreement  with nycomed gmbh  and the development  collaboration and license agreement dated may  with ucb  sa  or the ucb agreement  should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
we are amortizing the million payment received as part of the nycomed agreement over the expected obligation period  which is currently estimated to end in december nycomed is solely responsible for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of veltuzumab  for the subcutaneous formulation  for all non cancer indications 
the company s major obligations are to complete the research and development activities as specified in the nycomed agreement and to manufacture and supply veltuzumab to nycomed for the quantity of materials for the period of time specified in the nycomed agreement  using reasonable commercial efforts to manufacture the material 
the time period specified in the agreement is establishment by nycomed of a manufacturing process or a third party source of supply for veltuzumab within fifteen months of the effective date 
nycomed has selected a third party source for the manufacture of veltuzumab and we have transferred the necessary technology for the production of veltuzumab to them 
the company currently expects to complete all of its research and development activities  including the ongoing phase i ii study in itp and its manufacturing and supply obligations by december  if the obligation period estimate should change in the future  whether due to delays or acceleration of nycomed s requirements  this may affect the amortization period 
we have also concluded that the million payment received from ucb should be amortized over the expected obligation period of the ucb agreement  which was initially estimated to end in november during the fiscal year  ucb decided to stop further new patient enrollment into the systemic lupus erythematosus  or sle  clinical trials designed and initiated by us 
ucb decided to establish new protocols under which new clinical trials for the treatment of sle would be conducted and subsequently terminated the then existing sle clinical trials that had been designed and initiated by us 
as a result of the ucb decision to terminate the two phase iii sle trials  initiated by us  we were no longer able to determine how these decisions will impact the obligation period for our remaining potential manufacturing responsibilities under the terms of the agreement with ucb 
accordingly  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we ceased amortizing to revenue the deferred revenue recorded with the receipt of the up front payments from ucb at the inception of the license agreement until such time as the obligation period was reasonably determinable 
under the terms of the ucb agreement  ucb is solely responsible for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of epratuzumab for the treatment of all autoimmune indications and for the continuation of ongoing clinical trials in sle  with immunomedics responsible for supplying epratuzumab for the completion of clinical trials relating to sle  the sjogren s phase ii clinical trial and the sle open label study as defined in the ucb agreement 
we were also obligated to manufacture and supply epratuzumab  if needed and at ucb s request  for the initial commercial launch of epratuzumab for the treatment of sle 
the manufacturing requirements were limited by our production capacity at that time 
ucb will have sole responsibility for all clinical development  regulatory filings and related submissions  as well as all commercialization activities with respect to epratuzumab in all autoimmune indications 
as of june  our only remaining obligation was to provide ucb with additional epratuzumab if requested 
subsequent to june   ucb relieved us of our remaining obligation to supply ucb with any further supplies for sle 
therefore  we expect to amortize the remainder of the million of deferred revenue from ucb as of june   as revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
research and development costs that are reimbursable under collaboration agreements are recognized in accordance with eitf issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf the reimbursement of research and development costs is included as a reduction of research and development expenses 
we record these reimbursements as a reduction of research and development expenses as our partner in the collaboration agreement has the financial risks and responsibility for conducting these research and development activities 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
auction rate securities we hold a number of interest bearing auction rate securities  or ars  that represent investments in pools of assets 
these ars investments are intended to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  allowing investors to either roll over their holdings or gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par 
ars have long term scheduled maturities  but have interest rates that are typically reset at pre determined intervals every days for the securities purchased by us  at which time the securities can typically be purchased or sold  creating a liquid market 
in an active market for such investments  the rate reset for each instrument is an opportunity to accept the reset rate or sell the instrument at its face value in order to seek an alternative investment 
in the past  the auction process has allowed investors to roll over their holdings or obtain immediate liquidity by selling the securities at par 
the ars held are primarily aaa rated collateralized by student loans  guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and backed by insurance companies 
to date we have collected all interest payable on all ars when due and expect to continue to do so in the future 
as of june   we held six auction rate securities with a par value of million  and these securities are classified as non current investments on the consolidated balance sheet 
until february  the auction rate securities market was highly liquid 
during the week of february   a substantial number of auctions failed  meaning that there was not enough demand to sell the entire issue at auction 
these widespread failures have continued to date 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or a buyer is found outside of the auction process of which there is no assurance 
we reviewed ars for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
this treatment is appropriate when a loss in an investment is determined to be temporary in nature and a company concludes it does not intend to sell an impaired debt security and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and results in a charge to earnings for the applicable accounting period 
in evaluating the impairment of our ars  we classified such impairments as an other than temporary impairment 
the differentiating factors between temporary and other than temporary impairment are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and the intent and our ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
in prior years the ars were classified as current assets  as it was our intention to sell the securities when a secondary market for the ars developed 
however  the offers received for certain ars are not at terms that are presently acceptable 
as we believe we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents at june  for at least the next twelve months  it is not imperative to fund our operations by liquidating the ars held at unreasonable discounts 
therefore  the ars are classified as non current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of june  and will continue to be classified as such until market conditions improve and a viable market for these securities has developed 
as a result of our assessment of a number of factors  including without limitation  market conditions and the credit quality of these securities  we determined that the estimated fair value no longer approximates par value  although we continue to earn interest on the current auction rate security investments at the maximum contractual rate 
accordingly  beginning with the three month period ended march   we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million to reduce the value of the ars to their estimated fair value for the fiscal year 
for the year ended june   we recorded additional other than temporary impairment charges of million to reduce the value of the ars to their estimated fair value 
as of june   we estimated the fair value of these ars to be million 
we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars 
the significant assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model as of june  include i estimates for the investment s contractual bond coupon rates ranging from  ii the market yield interest rates estimated at the us treasury seven year bond rate of plus a premium factor of and iii the effective maturity period of approximately seven years which is the period it is estimated that the auctions would resume its normal function 
if our estimates regarding the fair value of these securities are inaccurate  a future other than temporary impairment charge may be required 
additionally  these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions and  as such  we may be required to record additional losses for impairment if we determine there are further declines in fair value 
during the year ended june   we reported  of amortization of the market value discount of the ars 
no amortization was reported for the fiscal year 
foreign currency risks for subsidiaries outside of the united states that operate in a local currency environment  income and expense items are translated to united states dollars at the monthly average rates of exchange prevailing during the year  assets and liabilities are translated at the period end exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity and are included in the determination of comprehensive loss 
transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of net income loss 
stock based compensation we currently have an employee share option plan  or the plan  which permits the grant of share options and shares to our employees for up to million shares of common stock 
a summary of this plan is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that such awards better align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders 
option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant  those option awards generally vest based on four years of continuous service and have seven year contractual terms 
certain options provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control as defined in the plan 
the fair value of each option granted during the years ended june   and is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions in the following table years ended june  expected dividend yield expected option term years expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate the weighted average fair value at the date of grant for options granted during the years ended june   and were  and per share  respectively 
we used historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
expected stock price volatility was calculated on ten year daily stock trading history 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have  non vested options and restricted stock outstanding 
as of june  and june  there was  and  respectively  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
that cost is being recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the weighted average remaining contractual terms of the exercisable shares is years and years as of june  and june   respectively 
impairment of assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon our judgment of our ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
life insurance policies the company has various life insurance policies on dr 
goldenberg  which are for the benefit of the company 
when the company is the beneficiary of the policy  and there are no other contractual arrangements between the company and dr 
goldenberg  the company recognizes the amount that could be realized under the insurance arrangement as an asset in the balance sheet 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of  or 
license fee and other revenue for the fiscal year was  compared to no license fee and other revenue in the fiscal year 
the fiscal year included  of amortization of deferred revenue as a result of the nycomed agreement executed in august the fiscal year did not include any amortization of deferred revenues from the ucb agreement due to the decision by ucb in february to stop patient enrollment into the sle clinical trials  as discussed in our critical accounting policy 
product sales for the year ended june  were  as compared to  for the same period in  representing an increase of  or due to increased sales of leukoscan in europe over the previous year  partially offset by the unfavorable currency impact of the euro 
research and development revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  for the same period of  an increase of  or 
this increase was the result of there being three phase ii grant programs in effect for most of fiscal year as compared to two smaller phase i grant programs in effect available in the previous year 
total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or  to  from  in fiscal year ended june  due primarily to expense reimbursements of  received from nycomed  partially offset by additional employees and related salaries and employee benefits 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or to  from  in fiscal year ended june  gross profit margins were for the fiscal year compared to for the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross profit percentage in fiscal was primarily due to our expensing of work in process inventory that failed our quality assurance testing in fiscal sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing an increase of  or 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due to higher salaries and taxes for european employees and increased selling expenses 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal year increased by  or from  in fiscal year to  this increase is primarily attributed to the termination of certain severance payments and insurance benefits as part of our previous employment agreement with dr 
david m 
goldenberg  and the termination of the split dollar insurance life insurance agreement and related liabilities  which occurred in the previous year  not recurring in the current year 
exclusive of the insurance related items  general and administrative expenses decreased  or as compared to the prior year 
a charge of  was reported for the year ended june  for an other than temporary impairment charge on marketable securities associated with our investments in auction rate securities as compared to a charge of  reported for the year ended june  see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this other than temporary impairment charge 
interest and other income for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  primarily due to the sale in the prior year of four executive life insurance contracts which were no longer deemed to be necessary resulting in  of other income and lower levels of investments as well as lower rates of return on investments 
this decrease was partially offset by  for the amortization of the discount for the auction rate securities and  gain on the settlement of  of auction rate securities 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of  and our foreign subsidiaries recorded a foreign tax provision of  for the fiscal year  we recorded a federal income tax provision of  and our foreign subsidiaries recorded a foreign tax provision of  the tax benefits for and fiscal years were also partially offset by new jersey state income tax provisions of  and  respectively

total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  increased by  or  to  from  in fiscal year ended june  due primarily to increased headcount and related salaries  employee benefits and higher patent expenses 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year ended june  decreased by  or to  from  in fiscal year ended june  gross profit margins were for the fiscal year compared to for the fiscal year 
the improvement in the gross profit percentage in fiscal was primarily due to improved production yields experienced in in the manufacturing process of leukoscan as compared to the fiscal year ended june   partially offset by increased costs associated with higher sales of diagnostic kits in fiscal year ended june  sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing an increase of  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due to higher salaries and taxes for european employees as a result of the decline in the us dollar

see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this other than temporary impairment charge 
interest and other income for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year  primarily due to the sale of four executive life insurance contracts which were no longer deemed to be necessary resulting in  of other income 
interest expense decreased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year this decrease resulted primarily from the conversion of the senior convertible notes into the company s common stock during the fiscal year

net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year research and development expenses research and development expenses for our product candidates in development were  for the fiscal year ended june    for the fiscal year ended june  and  for the fiscal year ended june  research and development expenses decreased by  in or as compared to research and development expenses increased by  in or as compared to we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation or through clinical trials and therefore we do not provide a breakdown of such historical information in that format 
we evaluate projects under development from an operational perspective  including such factors as results of individual compounds from laboratory animal testing  patient results and enrollment statistics in clinical trials 
it is important to note that multiple product candidates are often tested simultaneously 
it is not possible to calculate each antibody s supply costs 
there are many different development processes and test methods that examine multiple product candidates at the same time 
we have  historically  tracked our costs in the categories discussed below  specifically research costs and product development costs and by the types of costs outlined below 
our research costs consists of outside costs associated with animal studies and costs associated with research and testing of our product candidates prior to reaching the clinical stage 
such research costs primarily include personnel costs  facilities  including depreciation  lab supplies  funding of outside contracted research and license fees 
our product development costs consist of costs from preclinical development including manufacturing  conducting and administering clinical trials and patent expenses 
the following table sets forth a breakdown of our research and development expenses by those associated with research and those associated with product development for the periods indicated 
years ended june  in thousands research costs product development costs total research costs research costs in total increased by  or for the year ended june  research costs in total increased by  or for the year ended june  the changes in research costs primarily relate to the following personnel costs in were  an increase of  or as compared to  a result of increased employee staffing levels 
personnel costs in were  an increase of  or as compared to this increase was a result of an increase to the employee headcount to offset the previous years attrition 
the use of outside research services in were  an increase of  or to compared to this increase resulted from research activities performed for the company for increased federal grant program activities and other necessary commercial research support which is not available in our existing facility 
outside services in were  or  lower than  a reduction of 
this decrease resulted from the reduction in the level of testing for toxicity studies for compounds in the preclinical stage of product development 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  an increase of  or from this increase was a result of the replenishment of supplies from the previous year arising from the company s cost savings efforts during the fiscal year 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  a decrease of  or from  resulting from cost control efforts implemented by the company prior to the nycomed agreement in august product development costs product development costs for the year ended june  in total decreased by  or as compared to product development costs for the year ended june  in total increased by  or as compared to the changes in product development costs primarily relate to the following in the company benefited from the reimbursement by nycomed of  of product manufacturing expenses for product development costs incurred for veltuzumab  the result of the nycomed agreement completed in august clinical trial expenses in fiscal year were  an increase of  or over this increase was a result of increased patient enrollment in clinical trials in clinical trial expenses in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or over the reduction in these expenses in was primarily the result of the closure of a number of clinical trials that were either completed or which the company decided it was no longer going to pursue 
personnel costs in were  an increase of  or as compared to  due primarily to salary increases 
this increase resulted from an increase in employee staffing levels over personnel costs in were  an increase of  or as compared to this increase was primarily a result of an increase to the employee headcount to offset the previous years attrition and to provide for increased product development and quality control efforts 
patent expenses for were  a reduction of  or from this reduction resulted from an effort to control patent filings and support expenses  including bringing in a number of these services into the company  partially offset by high professional fees for patent litigation defense 
patent expenses for were  an increase of  or over the increase for was primarily due to higher professional fees incurred for patent litigation defense 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  a decrease of  or over the reduction in was primarily due to the timing of material purchases 
lab supplies and chemical reagent costs were  in  an increase of  or over the increase for was primarily the result of increased production development efforts over the previous year 
expenses for outside testing were  in  a decrease of  or from this decrease was primarily from the reduction of the number of tests performed for process validations and product safety in expenses for outside testing were  in  an increase of  or over this increase was primarily for procedures performed for testing for product safety and validations for manufacturing process 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time varies according to the type  complexity and the disease indication of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following periods clinical phase estimated completion period phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and cost of clinical trials through each of the clinical phases may vary significantly over the life of a particular project as a result of  among other things  the following factors the length of time required to recruit qualified patients for clinical trials  the duration of patient follow up in light of trials results  the number of clinical sites required for trials and  the number of patients that ultimately participate 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception in  immunomedics principal sources of funds have been the private and public sale of debt and equity securities and revenues from licensing 
there can be no assurance that immunomedics will be able to raise the additional capital it will need on commercially acceptable terms if at all 
if the company were unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  its ability to continue its business would be materially and adversely affected 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended june  was million  compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended june  the improvement in the current year s cash flow from operations is primarily the result from the proceeds of the million upfront payment from the completion of the nycomed agreement in august on july   we entered into the nycomed agreement providing nycomed gmbh an exclusive worldwide license to develop  manufacture  and commercialize veltuzumab  our humanized anti cd antibody  in the subcutaneous formulation  for the treatment of all non cancer indications 
under the terms of the nycomed agreement  we retain the right to develop veltuzumab in the field of oncology 
in addition  we will continue our ongoing phase i ii study in immune thrombocytopenic purpura  or itp  and nycomed will reimburse us for all expenses incurred in connection with this study 
the nycomed agreement also provides us with an option to co promote veltuzumab for the treatment of itp in the united states 
for the fiscal year  despite the loss from operations of million for the year  the net cash used in operations was million lower than the loss on operations due to the receipt of million for the cash surrender value from the termination of executive life insurance policies in fiscal and non cash charges  primarily the million impairment charge on marketable securities and million of depreciation expense 
for the fiscal year  the net cash used in operations was million higher than the million loss on operations 
this increase in cash used in operations resulted from the million non cash deferred revenue and the payment of million for accrued legal fee  partially offset by non cash charges for interest expense million  depreciation expense million and deferred compensation  million 
cash flows from investing 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  was  compared to million of net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended june  the investing activities for were a result of million in net proceeds of marketable securities 
in the current year  proceeds of  were received from the settlement of certain auction rate securities  partially offset by  of capital expenditures 
in fiscal year the company purchased million of marketable securities utilizing a portion of the million of proceeds received from the ucb agreement in may cash flows from financing 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended june  was  which resulted primarily from the settlement of  employee stock options by the company 
for the year ended june  the net cash used in financing activities of million was for the payment of debt 
the cash provided from financing activities in the fiscal year ended june  was primarily due to net proceeds received from the sale of common stock of million in may  which more than offset the million payment of debt for the year 
at june   we had working capital deficit of  representing a decline of  from  of working capital at june  this decrease in working capital is primarily a result of the reclassification of our ars to non current assets at december  due to the existing market conditions and the failure of a market to develop for ars and the reclassification of  of the ucb agreement deferred revenue outstanding from long term to current  as the deferred revenue is expected to be reported as revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year 
partially offsetting these classification changes was the receipt of the million of upfront payment for the nycomed agreement in august  a portion of which million is included as deferred revenue in current liabilities in the balance sheet and which is expected to be recognized in the fiscal year 
the upfront proceeds from the nycomed agreement was utilized to fund the cash used in operations of  which represents net income excluding the million of license fee revenue that was recognized under the nycomed agreement 
our cash and cash equivalents of  represent an increase of  from  at june  the increase was primarily attributable to our receipt of the million upfront payment from the nycomed agreement  partially offset by our use of cash in operations for the year ended june  our auction rate securities consist primarily of aaa rated securities that have an estimated fair value of million 
auctions for our invested amounts began failing in february and have not succeeded since then  and we have been unable to liquidate our auction rate securities at par 
in the event we need or desire to access these funds  we will not be able to do so until a future auction on these investments is successful or a buyer is found outside the auction process 
if a buyer is found  such buyer may only be willing to purchase the investments at a price below par 
further  rating downgrades of the security issuer or the third parties insuring such investments may further impact our ability to auction or sell these securities 
it is possible that the potential lack of liquidity in our auction rate security investments could adversely affect our ability to fund our future operations 
we cannot predict whether future auctions related to auction rate securities will be successful 
we are currently seeking alternatives for reducing our exposure to the auction rate market  but may not be able to identify any such alternative 
with the million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at june   we believe we have sufficient funds to continue our operations and research and development programs for at least the next twelve months 
during fiscal  cash expenditures for our current research and development programs will be at a higher level than in fiscal year due to increased spending for research and development and clinical trial activities  while a number of new clinical studies are supported by the company and our corporate partners 
we are also advancing plans to initiate a phase iii registration trial of veltuzumab in non hodgkin s lymphoma  for which we are considering a number of funding alternatives in the event we decide to begin this trial 
we expect research and development activities to continue to expand over time and we do not believe we will have adequate cash to complete our research and development compounds in our development pipeline in line with our corporate strategy 
as a result  we will continue to require additional financial resources in order to continue our research and development programs  clinical trials of product candidates and regulatory filings 
our ability to raise capital through public and private debt or equity financings may be negatively impacted by the recent downturn in the economy 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available when we need it on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise the additional capital we will need on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise capital on acceptable terms  our ability to continue our business would be materially and adversely affected 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item a risk factors  factors that may affect our business and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us  and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources when necessary to fund our strategic priorities

recently issued accounting pronouncements staff position no 
 fas and eitf  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp 
fsp provides new guidance on the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and provides new disclosure requirements 
the recognition and presentation provisions apply only to debt securities classified as available for sale and held to maturity 
at present the adoption of this pronouncement will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as we are not currently able to hold our auction rate securities to maturity 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 subsequent events sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements and whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this standard also provides clarification about circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning with our fiscal year ended june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those described due to a number of factors  including uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and conditions impacting our industry 
during the early part of  securities known as auction rate securities ars  which historically have had a liquid market and had their interest rates reset periodically eg  monthly through dutch auctions  began to fail 
these widespread failures have continued to date 
consequently  the investments are not currently liquid and the company will not be able to access these funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the issuer redeems the securities  or a buyer is found outside of the auction process  of which there is no assurance 
as of june   the company has million invested in ars with long term nominal maturities for which interest rates are reset through a dutch auction each month 
the company s investments in ars all currently have aaa aaa credit ratings and interest continues to be paid by the issuers of the securities 
the ars held are all aaa rated collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and backed by insurance companies 
the estimated fair market value at june   of the company s ars with continuing auction failures totaled approximately million 
the company estimated the fair value of these auction rate securities using a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of its investment in ars as of june  the company reviews for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and sec in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
this treatment is appropriate when a loss in an investment is determined to be temporary in nature and the company has the intent and ability to hold the investment until a recovery in market value takes place 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations and reduces net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
the company determined that the entire impairment related to its ars was other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge in other income expense on its consolidated statements of operations 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for our investment portfolio in marketable securities as of june  expected maturity date and thereafter total fair value in thousands variable rate average interest rate we may be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in regards to certain agreements with service providers relating to certain clinical trials that are in process 
depending on the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar  realized and unrealized currency fluctuations could be significant
