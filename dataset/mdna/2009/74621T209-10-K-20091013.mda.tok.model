the financial statements presented herein  and discussed below  have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
overview pure bioscience sometimes referred to herein as the company  we us or our was incorporated in the state of california on august  we began as a provider of pharmaceutical water purification products for the pharmacy market 
in  we commenced investments in the development of novel bioscience technologies  and subsequent to the may sale of our water treatment division we have been exclusively focused on the development and commercialization of our current and future bioscience products 
we are expanding into markets with broad potential by developing new  proprietary bioscience products based upon our patented silver ion antimicrobial technologies 
we are developing technology based bioscience products  including our silver dihydrogen citrate based antimicrobials  which we believe can provide novel  non toxic solutions to numerous global health challenges and represent innovative advances in diverse markets 
we believe that our technologies are in a position to contribute significantly to today s global trend toward industrial and consumer use of environmentally friendly products  while providing competitive advantages in efficacy and safety 
bioscience technologies our flagship bioscience technology is a patented  aqueous antimicrobial called silver dihydrogen citrate sdc 
a new molecular entity  sdc is an electrolytically generated source of stabilized ionic silver that can serve as the basis for a broad range of products in diverse markets 
sdc liquid is colorless  odorless  tasteless  non caustic and formulates well with other compounds 
as a platform technology  our sdc based antimicrobial is distinguished from competitors in the marketplace because of its superior efficacy combined with reduced toxicity 
we are producing and plan to expand the production of pre formulated  ready to use products for private label distribution  as well as varying strengths of sdc concentrate as an additive or raw material for inclusion in other companies products  including as an active pharmaceutical ingredient 
in addition to sdc  we have obtained patent protection for ionic silver based molecular entities utilizing organic acids other than citric acid 
we also own certain rights to a patent pending pesticide technology  triglycylboride which  like sdc  provides effective results without human toxicity and is an alternative to traditional poisons 
triglycylboride has been formulated into the products roachx and antx  however these products are not currently being actively marketed or developed 
sources of revenue our principal sources of revenue are comprised of sales of sdc concentrate as well as both bulk and individually bottled sdc based hard surface disinfectant 
sdc concentrate is sold to distributors that either resell the concentrate as an active ingredient or preservative in other companies products  or blend the product into hard surface disinfectant products for sale to retail  commercial and institutional customers 
sdc based hard surface disinfectant is sold in bulk and as individually bottled products to distributors that in turn sell the product to retail  commercial and institutional customers 
in addition to sales of sdc concentrate and finished goods  we anticipate generating additional revenues from licensing and royalty arrangements in future periods 
because the development of our sdc technology is at an early stage of development and commercialization  it is difficult to predict our revenues 
our historical revenues have fluctuated from period to period based on factors that include  but are not limited to  the timing of regulatory approvals regarding our and our partners products containing sdc  the timing of product launches by both our strategic partners and  in some cases  their customers and partners  the timing of our entry into new strategic agreements  and the quantities of our products required by our partners to effect new research programs and product launches 
our revenues have historically fluctuated from period to period 
for example  in fiscal we reported revenues from product sales of  compared with revenue from product sales for fiscal of  among other factors  during fiscal we recorded product revenue of  for sales to two international distributors for whom we did not recognize any revenue in fiscal in future periods  we expect our revenues to continue to fluctuate 
in some cases  such as under our agreement with basf  we will not be aware of the launch of products containing sdc until they are available to end users 
in february the first name brand personal care products containing sdc as the active ingredient were launched in europe by a customer of basf 
notwithstanding that we sold the sdc used as an active ingredient in the product  we were not able to anticipate this launch due to the contractual rights of basf and its customer 
cost of revenues and operating expenses costs of revenue 
costs of product revenue include materials consumed  manufacturing overheads  shipping costs  salaries  benefits and related expenses of operations 
in addition  included in our inventory of finished goods as of july  are approximately  gallons of sdc concentrate that we purchased from an unrelated third party in a lien sale see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this transaction 
this transaction had no impact on our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  however it is expected to temporarily reduce our cost of goods sold per gallon of sdc concentrate sold in future periods 
gross profit on product sales represents net revenue less the costs of revenue 
gross profit percentage is highly dependent on pricing  contractual agreements  overhead allocations and other factors 
we do not believe that historical gross profit margins on product sales are a reliable indicator of future gross profit margins 
during the three month period ended january  we recorded  of licensing revenue on the expiration of an agreement whereby we allowed a third party a limited time period to exclusively evaluate our sdc technology 
cost of goods sold related to this revenue was zero  as we did not incur any costs directly related to our commitments under the agreement 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  and amounts paid to third party providers for marketing  sales  public relations and advertising  along with promotional and trade show costs and travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses also include share based compensation allocable to employees and third party advisors performing services related to sales and marketing 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include employee salaries and benefits  and amounts paid to third party providers for finance and accounting  legal activities  human resources  insurance  information technology  and other administrative activities 
general and administrative expenses also include share based compensation allocable to employees and third party advisors performing general and administrative services 
research and development 
research and development costs include in house research costs  expenditures for third party testing  patent amortization  outside legal costs for maintaining issued patents  and product registration expenditures 
we do not currently expect our research and development expense to grow significantly in future periods  however if opportunities arise  particularly in the development and testing of new formulations  we will evaluate the need for additional research expenditures based on potential market sizes and our estimation of the likelihood of our technology achieving successful results 
research and development expenses also include share based compensation allocable to employees and third party advisors performing services related to research and development 
critical accounting policies accounting for long lived assets intangible assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  consisting of property  plant  equipment and finite lived intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or circumstances include an asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to an asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used in operations is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
the factors used to evaluate the future net cash flows  while reasonable  requires a high degree of judgment and the results could vary if the actual results are materially different than the forecasts 
in addition  we base useful lives and amortization or depreciation expense on our subjective estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise be used by us 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
we also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
accounting for stock based compensation we adopted the fair value provisions of sfas r on august  stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after august  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
specifically  we estimate the weighted average fair value of options granted using the black scholes option pricing model based on evaluation assumptions regarding expected volatility  dividend yield  risk free interest rates  the expected term of the option and the expected forfeiture rate 
each of these assumptions  while reasonable  requires a certain degree of judgment and the fair value estimates could vary if the actual results are materially different than those initially applied 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we were not required to record compensation cost in the consolidated financial statements for stock options issued to employees or directors 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides a single definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosures concerning fair value 
previously  different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures 
sfas no 
applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value  except statement no 
r and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities to years beginning after november  our fiscal year ending july  
as a result  we are only partially adopting sfas no 
as it relates to our financial assets and liabilities until we are required to apply this pronouncement to our non financial assets and liabilities beginning with the fiscal year ending july  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
most of the provisions in sfas no 
are elective  however the amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
the fair value option established by sfas no 
permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
under sfas no 
 we would report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
this statement became effective for us on august   however we did not elect the fair value option for any of our financial assets or financial liabilities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas no 
 business combinations and requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  including those arising from contractual contingencies  any contingent consideration  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in sfas r 
sfas r also amends sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations  if any  for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  our fiscal year ending july  
in april  the fasb issued sfas r  accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies  which amends the accounting prescribed in sfas r for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations 
sfas r requires pre acquisition contingencies to be recognized at fair value if fair value can be reasonably determined during the measurement period 
if fair value cannot be reasonably determined  sfas r requires measurement based on the recognition and measurement criteria of sfas  accounting for contingencies 
the adoption of the provisions of sfas r or sfas r did not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows for fiscal in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it also clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas also changes the way the consolidated income statement is presented by requiring consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the non controlling interest 
it also requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of income  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest 
sfas requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and requires expanded disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent owners and the interests of the non controlling owners of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for fiscal periods  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  our fiscal year ending july  
we do not currently expect the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp no 
fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
r  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
the provisions of fsp no 
fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year ending july  
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of fsp no 
fas could have on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issue task force eitf  determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides a framework for determining whether an instrument is indexed to an entity s own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year ending july  
we do not currently expect the implementation of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp fas  which clarifies the application of sfas in an inactive market 
additional guidance is provided regarding how a reporting entity s own assumptions should be considered when relevant observable inputs do not exist  how available observable inputs in a market that is not active should be considered when measuring fair value  and how the use of market quotes should be considered when assessing the relevance of inputs available to measure fair value 
fsp fas became effective immediately upon issuance 
its adoption did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp 
based on the guidance  if an entity determines that the level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and that a transaction is not orderly  further analysis of transactions or quoted prices is needed  and a significant adjustment to the transaction or quoted prices may be necessary to estimate fair value in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
fsp is to be applied prospectively and became effective for us as fiscal the adoption of fsp did not have an impact on the company s consolidated results or financial condition 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments fsp fas and fsp apb 
fsp fas amends sfas no

fsp apb amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require those disclosures in all interim financial statements 
fsp fas and fsp apb also require disclosure about the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
fas fsp and fsp apb became effective for us as of fiscal their adoption did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff positions fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments fsp and  which amend the other than temporary guidance in us gaap for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements

sfas provides rules on recognition and disclosure for events and transactions occurring after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued 
in addition  sfas requires a reporting entity to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated  as well as whether that date is the date the financial statements are issued or the date the financial statements are available to be issued

r fas 
fas amends fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december an interpretation of arb no 
 to require an issuer to perform an analysis to determine whether the issuer s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  if any 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as one with the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest 
fas will be effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period commencing after november  our fiscal quarter ending october

we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations for the year ended july  fiscal versus the year ended july  fiscal revenue and gross margin for fiscal  product revenues of  declined by  or  compared with fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the recording of revenue of  in fiscal for sales to two international distributors for whom we did not recognize any revenue in fiscal product revenues for each of the periods presented were derived from sales of finished products to our partners and distributors  and product sold to our partners for product development and testing 
during fiscal  of product sales were made to five strategic partners that are also developing markets for our products 
of revenue from product sales for the year was derived from sales made to us domestic customers 
during fiscal  of product sales were made to five strategic partners  and of revenue from product sales for the year was derived from sales made to us domestic customers 
in some cases we have  or may have in future periods  distributors or strategic partners to whom we have granted rights to sell our technology in multiple countries 
generally  we do not require such distributors to report to us the quantities of products that they sell in each country 
in such cases  we report revenues based on the country of first sale 
gross profit on product sales for fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal the gross margin percentage declined from in fiscal to for fiscal the decline is primarily due to an increased proportion of lower margin products sold in the most recent period 
during fiscal  of our product sales were of bulk sdc concentrate  and of our product sales were of bulk axen or finished packaged products containing axen  our ready to use product 
during the prior year  of our product sales were of bulk sdc concentrate and of our product sales were of bulk axen or finished packaged products containing axen we generally sell our sdc bulk concentrate at higher margins than our ready to use products 
during fiscal we recorded deferred revenue on receipt of a non refundable fee of  which we received subject to an agreement whereby we allowed a third party a limited time period to exclusively evaluate our sdc technology for use within specified indications and for certain products 
upon the termination of the agreement on january   we recognized the  as licensing revenue in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal cost of goods sold related to this revenue was zero  as we did not incur any costs directly related to our commitments under the agreement 
operating costs operating costs declined by  from  in fiscal  to  in fiscal within these aggregate operating costs  selling expenses declined by  to  in fiscal  compared with fiscal the decrease in selling expenses is primarily due to  of employee and consultant stock option expense recorded in the prior year  which was partially offset by increased salary expense in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal included in general and administrative expense for fiscal is  of bad debt expense 
this amount is made up of amounts billed during prior periods to two international distributors 
during fiscal we granted non exclusive distribution and blending rights to a new distributor for the sale of sdc based products in colombia 
in addition  we granted non exclusive distribution and blending rights to a second distributor  which is affiliated with the first distributor  for the sale of sdc based products in argentina  venezuela  panama and costa rica 
the  receivable includes  for amounts billed at cost to the distributors in august for parts shipped directly to them by one of our us packaging suppliers 
subsequent to this transaction  we have not sold any products to either of the two referenced distributors 
during the three month period ended january  we determined these accounts to be delinquent  established a full reserve and recorded  as bad debt expense  within general and administrative expense 
at july  the referenced amounts remained uncollected  and we have written off the full receivable of  management currently considers all other accounts receivable to be fully collectible 
this increase in expense was offset by a decline of  in stock and stock option expense within general and administrative expense  the most significant factor being  of stock and stock option expense recorded in fiscal for option and stock grants made to our officers and directors 
in april  we granted options  which vested on the date of grant  to purchase  shares of common stock to directors and officers of the company  valued at approximately  we also granted  shares of common stock to each of three independent directors of the company  the aggregate of  shares being valued at   of the expense for these option and stock grants was booked to general and administrative expense in fiscal this expense was partially offset by  of expense recorded in fiscal for option and stock grants made to our officers and directors in may we issued options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  to our three executive officers  granted  shares of restricted stock to four of our directors  and issued a five year option to purchase  shares of common stock to one of our directors 
the aggregate fair value for fiscal grants was  however as each award has vesting requirements  only  of the expense was recorded within the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal we recognized employee and director stock option and stock grant non cash expense in general and administrative expenses for fiscal of  and for fiscal of  general and administrative payroll expense increased by  year over year due to new hires and salary increases  and accounting and legal fees increased by  additionally  insurance  depreciation  rent  board of directors committee fees  and investor relations and public relations expense  accounted for  of the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal compared with fiscal research and development costs  including in house costs  patent amortization  outside legal costs for maintaining approved patents  and product registration expenditures  declined in fiscal by to  from  in fiscal the decline in expense is primarily related to a decline of  in patent related legal fees and a decline of  in employee and director stock option expense 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in payroll and in consulting costs 
we do not currently expect our research and development expense to grow significantly in future periods  however if opportunities arise  particularly in the development and testing of new formulations  we will evaluate the need for additional research expenditures based on potential market sizes  our estimation of the likelihood of our technology achieving successful results  and the availability of working capital 
in july we suspended the development and marketing efforts for our triglycylboride boric acid based pesticides in order to focus on the development of our sdc and related technologies 
we concurrently wrote down the net unamortized balance of the capitalized patents associated with the triglycylboride technology  which amounted to  and recorded an impairment charge of  within operating costs on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal our loss from operations before taxes and other income increased by  from a loss of  in fiscal to a loss of  in fiscal other income other income declined by  in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to gains on the sale of t bills recorded in the prior year  and decreased interest income from lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense for fiscal and was  the minimum franchise tax we pay to the state of california regardless of income or loss 
all other federal or state tax liabilities were offset by current period losses or available federal and california net operating loss carry forwards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin became effective for us on august  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position for fiscal or  as we had no unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect our effective income tax rate in future periods 
our practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense  however we had no accrued interest or penalties at either august  or july  at july   we had federal and california tax net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
realization of our deferred tax assets  which relate to operating loss carry forwards and timing differences  is dependent on future earnings 
the timing and amount of future earnings are uncertain and therefore we establish a valuation allowance 
net income loss our net loss after taxes increased by  from a net loss of  in fiscal to a net loss of  in fiscal results of operations for the year ended july  fiscal versus the year ended july  fiscal revenue and gross margin for fiscal  revenues of  increased by  compared with fiscal the increase is primarily due to sales made to new customers with whom we had entered into development and distribution agreements during fiscal of sales for fiscal were made to one strategic partner and of our sales were made to the largest four partners 
of sales for fiscal were made to international customers and were made to us domestic customers  compared with made to international customers and made to us domestic customers during fiscal gross profit on product sales for fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal the gross margin percentage improved from in fiscal to in fiscal the improvement is primarily due to an increased proportion of higher margin products sold in fiscal compared with fiscal during fiscal  of our product sales were of bulk sdc concentrate and of our product sales were of bulk axen or finished packaged products containing axen  our ready to use product 
during fiscal  of our product sales were of bulk sdc concentrate and of our product sales were of bulk axen  finished packaged products containing axen  blending systems and roachx 
we generally sell our sdc bulk concentrate at higher margins than our other products 
operating costs operating costs increased by  from  in fiscal  to  for fiscal within these aggregate operating costs  selling expenses  which are primarily made up of our business development consultants and employees and their associated expenses declined by  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal the decline in selling expense in fiscal is primarily due to a  decrease in stock option expense  the majority of which is for grants made to third party consultants and advisors 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to  in fiscal  compared with fiscal stock option expense within general and administrative expense increased by approximately  for fiscal  compared with the prior year 
in april  we granted options to purchase  shares of our common stock  which vested on their date of grant  to directors and officers of the company 
the fair value of these grants was approximately  we also granted  shares of common stock to each of three directors of the company  the aggregate of  shares being valued at  and we also issued  fully vested options to purchase our common stock to a new director  for which we recorded  of general and administrative expense 
we also issued  shares of our common stock with a fair value of  for a legal settlement 
the total expense for option and stock grants booked to general and administrative expense in fiscal was during fiscal  we incurred non cash expense of  for stock options granted to officers and directors during the year  based on their black scholes valuation at the grant date  including a grant made to a new director and stock awarded to directors based on the market price of the common stock at the award date 
general and administrative payroll and payroll related expense increased by approximately  year over year due to new hires and salary increases  accounting fees increased by approximately  and costs for fiscal also included  in fees related to the april listing of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market 
legal fees charged to general and administrative expense  primarily related to the development of contracts and the protection of our intellectual property  increased by  for fiscal compared with the prior year 
additionally  sarbanes oxley compliance costs  travel expenses  depreciation  and health insurance costs all increased in fiscal compared with fiscal research and development costs increased in fiscal by  to  compared with fiscal expense for fiscal included  of non cash stock option expense for grants made to officers during the period 
there were no such grants made to officers during fiscal additionally  during fiscal  we incurred  of expense for patent related legal services provided in prior years 
research and development payroll and payroll related expense increased by  year over year due to new hires and salary increases  and third party testing costs for fiscal increased by  over the prior year 
these expense increases were partially offset by a decline of  in consulting fees paid to outside advisors  including  of non cash expense in fiscal for the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in july we suspended the development and marketing efforts for our triglycylboride boric acid based pesticides in order to focus on the development of our sdc and related technologies 
we concurrently wrote down the net unamortized balance of the capitalized patents associated with the triglycylboride technology  which amounted to  and recorded an impairment charge of  within operating costs on the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal our loss from operations before taxes and other income increased by  from a loss of  for fiscal to a loss of  for fiscal other income other income declined by  for fiscal compared with fiscal gains on the sale of us treasury bills were almost entirely offset by decreased interest income from lower average cash balances and lower interest rates 
income taxes income tax expense for fiscal and fiscal was  the minimum franchise tax we pay to the state of california regardless of income or loss 
all other federal or state tax liabilities were offset by current period losses or available federal and california net operating loss carry forwards

net income loss our net loss after taxes increased by  from a net loss of  for fiscal to a net loss of  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources fiscal vs 
fiscal from inception through the present  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our equity securities  through lines of credit and the issuance of debentures  and in may by the sale of our water treatment division 
at july   we had cash and cash equivalents of  no short term investments  and no long term debt 
on september   subsequent to the end of fiscal  we closed a registered direct offering whereby we sold million of our common stock and warrants to institutional investors 
after fees and expenses  the net proceeds of this offering to us were approximately million 
total current assets at july  were  a decline of  from july   of this decline was in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash used in operating activities for fiscal was  compared with  for fiscal the increase in operating cash expenditures is primarily due to reduced revenue collections and increased general and administrative expenses  and the timing of the payment of accounts payable

at july   we had total liabilities of  a decline of  from july   primarily due to a decline in accounts payable and a decline in deferred revenue 
the decline in deferred revenue is primarily related to the receipt in fiscal of a non refundable fee of  which we received subject to an agreement whereby we allowed a third party a limited time period to exclusively evaluate our sdc technology 
the fee was recognized into revenue in fiscal fiscal versus fiscal during fiscal  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased by  due primarily to  raised in a private placement of common stock and  in cash received from the exercise of stock options during fiscal  which was partially offset by  of cash used in operations for the year

during fiscal we spent approximately  to redevelop the manufacturing and office areas of our el cajon facility 
future cash needs during the next twelve months  we anticipate making significant investments in manufacturing processes  to improve efficiency and to be able to meet anticipated demand  in regulatory applications for new products or additional claims  in our corporate and business development infrastructure  and in programs required for us to maintain our compliance with securities laws as well as the listing standards of the nasdaq capital market  among other investments 
we believe  however  that our cash resources are sufficient to meet our anticipated needs during the next twelve months 
our assessment is based on historical working capital needs  operating loss trends  and our current business outlook 
in future periods we may need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt  equity  convertible securities or through other means  any one of which could reduce the value to us  perhaps substantially  of our technology and its commercial potential 
we currently have no long term debt  however the issuance of debt  equity or convertible securities in future periods  if any  could lead to the dilution of our existing shareholders 
there is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
insufficient funds could cause us to fail to execute our business plan  fail to take advantage of future opportunities  or fail to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated consumer requirements  and further may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  license to third parties the right to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise commercialize ourselves  or to reduce or cease operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk at july  was related to our investment portfolio which consisted largely of institutional money market mutual funds investing 
from time to time our investments may be exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our current investment policy is to maintain an investment portfolio consisting only of diversified institutional money market mutual funds investing in a s p or prime moody s  us treasury securities  or united states government obligations issued by or backed by a federal agency of the united states government 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes  and our cash is deposited in  and invested through  highly rated financial institutions in the united states 
while our available for sale securities  if any  are subject to interest rate risk and would fall in value if market interest rates increased  we estimate that the fair value of such an investment portfolio would not decline by a material amount in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
we therefore would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates 
we have operated mainly in the united states  and during the fiscal years ended july    and  all of our sales  both international and domestic  have been denominated in us dollars 
additionally  our purchases are predominantly made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
