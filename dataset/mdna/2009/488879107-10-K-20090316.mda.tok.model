item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data section and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in the item a risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we provide software  services and proprietary content that enable organizations to more effectively recruit and retain employees 
our solutions are built around a suite of easily configurable software applications that automate talent acquisition and employee performance management best practices 
we offer the software applications that form the core of our solutions on an on demand basis  which materially reduces the costs and risks associated with deploying traditional enterprise applications 
we complement our software applications with tailored combinations of outsourcing services  consulting services and proprietary content based on our years of experience assisting clients in addressing their human resource requirements 
together  our software applications and services form solutions that we believe enable our clients to improve the effectiveness of their talent acquisition programs  increase employee productivity and retention  measure key hr metrics and make their talent acquisition and employee performance management programs more efficient 
since  we have focused on providing talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions on a subscription basis and currently generate a significant portion of our revenue from these subscriptions 
for the years ended december  and  revenue from these subscriptions comprised approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue 
we generate the remainder of our revenue from discrete professional services that are not provided as part of an integrated solution on a subscription basis 
these subscription based solutions provide us with a recurring revenue stream and we believe represent a more compelling opportunity in terms of growth and profitability than discrete professional services 
since subscription revenue has represented approximately of our total revenue  we expect that trend to continue 
we sell our solutions to large and medium sized organizations through our direct sales force 
as of december   we had a client base of approximately  companies  including approximately companies on the fortune list published in april our client base includes companies that we billed for services during the year ended december  and does not necessarily indicate an ongoing relationship with each such client 
our top clients contributed approximately million  or  of our total revenue for the year ended december  over the past six months  as a result of the deteriorating financial conditions  the global economy has slowed to near historic lows  as measured by most indices 
unemployment in the united states was at a year high of in february and based upon recent survey data projected to be as high as by december during the last three months of  gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate  a rate not experienced in the united states since the recession  and much faster than previous government forecasts 
globally  the outlook was similar as the organization for economic cooperation and development s leading indicator edged closer to lows recorded during the oil shock of the early s 
taken together  all of these factors  ie high unemployment  slower domestic growth and global recession will most likely adversely affect our business in and perhaps beyond 
however  the extent or degree to which we may be affected by these events is extremely difficult to predict 
the uncertain economic prospects being experienced by our clients will likely translate into slower growth  or contraction  for us  since a substantial portion of our business is dependent upon our clients hiring and human capital needs 
however  we believe that by optimizing our internal resources for the current business conditions  we can minimize these adverse effects and emerge from this economic crisis with a stronger more efficient operating model 

table of contents although our compound annual growth of revenue for the three year period ending december  has been and our clients have historically renewed their subscriptions at approximately each year  some of our customers  facing uncertainty and cost pressures in their own businesses during the current economic downturn  have indicated that they are waiting to purchase our products and are otherwise increasingly seeking purchasing terms and conditions that are less favorable to us 
as a result of this trend  we experienced lower renewal rates during the second half of fiscal  resulting in a renewal rate by aggregate value of multi year subscriptions for the year ended december  of approximately and as a result we have forecasted lower business levels for the first quarter of as well 
due to the decline in our stock price and market capitalization  expected reductions in projected future net income  reduced future cash flow estimates and predicted slower growth rates in our industry  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million for the year ended december   representing a portion of our acquired goodwill 
if these trends persist additional impairment charges may be recorded in future periods 
although  in the intermediate term  our liquidity was adversely affected by the downturn in the credit markets and our credit facility may be affected by our non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter  we believe that the ubs settlement agreement for our auction rate securities  our cash and short term investments on hand  and our projected cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
background we commenced operations in as a provider of recruiting services to a wide variety of industries 
in  we offered our first automated talent acquisition system and by we had expanded our business to provide employee research  employee performance management technology and consulting services 
in late  responding to a growing demand from our customers  we embarked on a strategy to provide comprehensive human capital management services integrated with on demand software 
between and  we acquired businesses that collectively enabled us to offer comprehensive hcm services integrated with on demand technology 
over the past ten years  we have pursued a strategy designed to focus our business on talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions and reduce our strategic focus on discrete professional services that generated less predictable revenue streams and lower margins 
to that end in  we exited our temporary staffing business  in and  we acquired four businesses which enhanced our screening and behavioral assessment solutions and skills testing technologies  since  we have reduced our strategic focus on position specific recruiting services  in  we discontinued our oracle implementation business and discontinued and sold our pharmaceutical training division  in  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with scottworks solutions  inc  in  we enhanced our talent acquisition solutions and client base through our acquisitions of webhire  inc  knowledge workers inc  gantz wiley research  psychometric services ltd  and brassring inc  in  we enhanced our talent acquisition solutions and client base through our acquisitions of strategic outsourcing corporation and hrc human resources consulting  and in  we expanded our global footprint in the talent acquisition space through our acquisition of quorum international holdings limited 

table of contents as a result of our shift in strategic focus in  an increasing proportion of our revenue has been derived from talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions while a decreasing portion of our revenue has been derived from discrete professional services 
in  revenue derived from subscriptions for these solutions comprised approximately of our total revenue  in this percentage increased to of total revenue 
this shift to subscription based services has been driven by our customer s adoption of the on demand model for software delivery and need for solutions that improve employee recruiting and retention 
from our inception through  our operations were funded primarily through internally generated cash flows and our line of credit  as well as private placements of our securities to institutional investors in and on june   we completed our initial public offering and listed our common stock for trading on the nasdaq stock market 
recent events during the quarter ended december   due to a decline in our stock price and market capitalization  lower projected net income  cash flow estimates and slower projected growth rates in our industry  we reevaluated our goodwill impairment analysis 
our analysis was performed to determine the implied fair value of our goodwill with neither the write up or write down of any assets or liabilities  nor recording any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets 
based upon our analysis we determined that the implied fair value of the our goodwill was million as of december   resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
this goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances 
in response to the challenging macroeconomic environment  the strengthening us dollar  relative to other currencies of countries in which we do business and the resulting slowing or delaying of a number of project implementations  on november   we reduced our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter and year ended december  following this announcement  on november   due to the widespread deterioration in our business climate  we announced a restructuring program involving staff reductions of approximately of our workforce which included one time severance and outplacement benefit and certain legal fees totaling approximately million 
on april   we acquired quorum international holdings limited quorum  a provider of recruitment process outsourcing services based in london  england  for a purchase price of approximately million  in cash 
the total cost of the acquisition  including legal  accounting  and other professional fees of million  was approximately million 
in addition  the acquisition agreement contains an earn out provision which provides for the payment of additional consideration by the company based upon the gross profit of quorum for the twelve month period ending june  and june  formulaically the earnout is times quorum s gross profit less the amount of base consideration  as defined in the agreement 
the acquisition of quorum will broaden our presence in the global recruitment market 
on february   our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan providing for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock  of which million shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of million as of december  these shares were restored to original status and accordingly are presented as authorized but not issued 
the timing  price and volume of repurchases were based on market conditions  relevant securities laws and other factors 
as of december   we are authorized to repurchase approximately million shares by value under this stock repurchase plan 
in addition  in january  we repurchased million shares under a previously authorized stock repurchase plan for an aggregate cost of million 
sources of revenue we derive revenue primarily from two sources subscription revenue for our solutions  which is comprised of subscription fees from clients accessing our on demand software  consulting services  outsourcing services and proprietary content  and from clients purchasing additional support that is not included in the basic subscription fee  and fees for discrete professional services 

table of contents our clients primarily purchase renewable subscriptions for our solutions 
the typical term is one to three years  with some terms extending up to five years 
the majority of our subscription agreements are not cancelable for convenience although our clients have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to provide the agreed upon services or otherwise breach the agreement 
a client does not generally have a right to a refund of any advance payments if the contract is cancelled 
due to the current economic slowdown  a greater number of our customers are delaying or seeking to revise the terms and conditions of our service agreements 
as a result  we experienced for the year ended december  lower than expected renewal rates in the range of of the aggregate value of multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and performance management solution contracts rather than our historical renewal rate of approximately 
we expect this trend to continue in consistent with our historical practices  revenue derived from subscription fees is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription agreement 
we generally invoice our clients in advance in monthly or quarterly installments and typical payment terms provide that our clients pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable prior to the receipt of payment and in deferred revenue to the extent revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
because our revenue base has grown  the amount of deferred revenue on our balance sheet has increased 
as of december   deferred revenue increased to million from million at december  we generally price our solutions based on the number of software applications and services included and the number of client employees 
accordingly  subscription fees are generally greater for larger organizations and for those that subscribe for a broader array of software applications and services 
we derive other revenue from the sale of discrete professional services  and translation services as well as from out of pocket expenses 
the majority of our other revenue is derived from discrete professional services  which primarily consist of consulting and training services 
this revenue is recognized differently depending on the type of service provided as described in greater detail below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was derived from sales in the united states 
revenue that we generated from clients in canada  united kingdom  germany  and netherlands was approximately     respectively  for the year ended december  revenue for other countries amounted to an aggregate of 
other than the countries listed  no other country represented more than of our total revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in our percentage revenue derived from sales in the united states is primarily due to increased foreign sales 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees and independent contractors who provide consulting or other professional services to our clients 
additionally  our application hosting costs  amortization of third party license royalty costs  technical support personnel costs  overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses are also recorded as cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends  changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses and fluctuations in our client base 
because cost as a percentage of revenue is higher for professional services than for software products  an increase in the services component of our solutions or an increase in discrete professional services as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
as our overall revenue begins to decline  we expect our cost of revenue to decline proportionately  subject to pricing pressure related to economic conditions and slightly influenced by the mix of services and software 

table of contents operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as follows sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for employees engaged in sales and marketing  including salaries  commissions  and other variable compensation  travel expenses and costs associated with trade shows  advertising and other marketing efforts and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time the related revenue is recognized  and we recognize revenue from our subscription agreements ratably over the terms of the agreements 
over the past several years  our sales and marketing expense has increased in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue 
although we believe that our investment in sales and marketing commencing in resulted in significant revenue growth during through  based on recent economic conditions we have reduced our sales and marketing expenditures to adjust for expected lower rates of growth projections 
however  consistent with our past practice  we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing to pursue new clients and expand relationships with existing clients at levels we deem appropriate given our current economic conditions 
our sales and marketing expense has increased in absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue 
although our sales and marketing expense increased in both absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our sales and marketing expense to decrease  mainly due to reduced commission expense partially offset by increased branding expense  as business conditions dictate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs for our executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
based upon the current state of the economy  we believe that general and administrative expenses will remain the same or decrease in dollar amount and increase as a percentage of total revenue in research and development 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and related costs  including salaries  and employee benefits  for software engineers  quality assurance engineers  product managers  technical sales engineers and management information systems personnel 
our research and development efforts have been devoted primarily to enhancements and upgrades to our existing products 
capitalized software development costs increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in capitalized software development costs represents and of research and development expense for the years ended december  and  respectively and was directly attributable to an increase in the software development projects qualifying for capitalization  pursuant to sop this increase was due in part to greater use of third party software developers and improved precision of their time and activity reporting 
the remaining research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred 
we expect research and development expenses to remain flat or increase slightly as we continue to execute on our strategies which include furthering the common services enterprise architecture  introducing kenexa x modules  and continuing to develop feature enhancements 

table of contents key performance indicators the following tables summarize the key performance indicators that we consider to be material in managing our business for the year ended december  in thousands  except for percentages total revenue subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue loss income from operations before income tax and interest expense net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  in thousands deferred revenue for the year ended december   loss from operations before income taxes and interest expense includes goodwill impairment and restructuring charges of  and  respectively 
excluding these charges  non gaap income from operations before income taxes and interest expense would have been  the following is a discussion of some of the terms used in the tables above 
subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue can be derived from our consolidated statement of operations 
this performance indicator illustrates the evolution of our business towards subscription based solutions  which provide us with a recurring revenue stream and which we believe to be a more compelling revenue growth and profitability opportunity 
we expect that the percentage of subscription revenue will be in the range of of our total revenues through at least net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities is taken from our consolidated statement of cash flows and represents the amount of cash generated by our operations that is available for investing and financing activities 
historically  our net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded our net income primarily due to the positive impact of deferred revenue 
we expect this trend to continue because of the advance payment structure of our subscription agreements 
deferred revenue 
we generate revenue primarily from multi year subscriptions for our on demand talent acquisition and employee performance management solutions 
we recognize revenue from these subscription agreements ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one to three years 
we generally invoice our clients in quarterly or monthly installments in advance 
deferred revenue  which is included in our consolidated balance sheets  is the amount of invoiced subscriptions in excess of the amount recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue represents  in part  the amount that we will record as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
as the subscription component of our revenue has grown and customer willingness to pay us in advance for their subscriptions has increased  the amount of deferred revenue on our balance sheet has grown 
it is reasonably possible that this trend may vary as business conditions change 
the following table reconciles beginning and ending deferred revenue for each of the periods shown for the year ended december  in thousands deferred revenue at the beginning of the year total invoiced subscriptions during the year deferred revenue from acquisition subscription revenue recognized during the year deferred revenue at end of year 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and consolidated results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable and accrued expenses 
we base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two sources subscription revenues for solutions  which are comprised of subscription fees from clients accessing our on demand software  consulting services  outsourcing services and proprietary content  and from clients purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and other fees for professional services  translation services and reimbursed out of pocket expenses 
because we provide our solutions as a service  we follow the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
on august   we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the client  the collection of the fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
subscription fees and support revenues 
subscription fees and support revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the lives of the contracts 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recorded subscription fees and support revenues of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other revenue 
other revenue consists of discrete professional services  translation services and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
discrete professional services  when sold with subscription and support offerings  are accounted for separately since these services have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the delivered elements 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
additionally  when professional services are sold with other elements  the consideration from the revenue arrangement is allocated among the separate elements based upon the relative fair value 
revenues from professional services are recognized as the services are rendered 
in determining whether revenues from professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription revenue  we consider the following factors for each agreement availability of professional services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value exists of the undelivered elements  the nature and the timing of when the agreement was signed in comparison to the subscription agreement start date and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer s satisfaction with the other services 
if the professional service does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract 
in these situations we defer the direct and incremental costs of the professional service over the same period as the revenue is recognized 

table of contents we record reimbursable out of pocket expenses incurred in accordance with eitf issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which requires that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses be classified as revenue and not as cost reductions 
before the december  effective date of eitf issue  out of pocket reimbursements from clients were netted with the applicable costs 
these items primarily include travel  meals and certain telecommunication costs 
for the years ended december    and  reimbursed expenses totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from clients inability to pay us 
the provision is based on our historical experience and for specific clients that  in our opinion  are likely to default on our receivables from them 
in order to identify these clients  we perform ongoing reviews of all clients that have breached their payment terms  as well as those that have filed for bankruptcy or for whom information has become available indicating a significant risk of non recoverability 
in addition  we have experienced significant growth in number of clients  and we have less payment history to rely upon with these clients 
we rely on historical trends of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue and apply these percentages to the accounts receivable associated with new clients and evaluate these clients over time 
to the extent that our future collections differ from our assumptions based on historical experience  the amount of our bad debt and allowance recorded may be different 
capitalized software development costs in accordance with eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  we apply aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  will be capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
capitalization ceases upon completion of all substantial testing 
we also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality 
maintenance and training cost are expensed as incurred 
internal use software is amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  generally three years 
management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairments whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets 
there were no impairments to internal software in any of the periods covered in this report 
goodwill and other identified intangible asset impairment on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which superseded accounting board opinion no 
 intangible assets 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we ceased amortization of existing goodwill and are required to review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment 
if goodwill becomes impaired  some or all of the goodwill could be written off as a charge to operations 
this comparison is performed annually or more frequently if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carry amount 
during the quarter ended december  we reviewed the carrying values of goodwill at the enterprise or company level by comparing the carrying values to the estimated fair values of the enterprise 
the fair value is based on management s estimate of the future discounted cash flows to be generated by the enterprise and our market capitalization 
such cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  historical trends  as well as demand and competition 
comparable company multiples are based upon public companies in sectors relevant to our business based on our knowledge of the industry 
changes in the underlying business could affect these estimates  which in turn could affect our assessment of the recoverability of goodwill 
based on the analysis  we determined that the implied fair value of the our goodwill as of december  was million  resulting 
table of contents in a goodwill impairment charge of million for the year ended december  the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances  but did cause us to be out of compliance with certain covenants under our credit facility pursuant to which we did not as of december   and do not as of the date of this report  have any borrowings or the ability to borrow 
classification and fair value measurement of auction rate securities we hold investments in auction rate securities having contractual maturities of greater than one year and interest rate reset features of between and days 
these auction rate securities were priced and subsequently traded as short term investments because of the interest rate reset feature 
consequently  we have historically classified our auction rate securities as available for sale short term investments at par 
during  as a result of the deterioration in the credit markets  our auction rate securities failed to trade at recent auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
these events have led to uncertainty surrounding the short term liquidity of our auction rate security investments 
since it is not possible to predict when auctions for the securities we hold will succeed in the future  we have reclassified our auction rate securities to long term investments on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  our auction rate securities  which have a par value of million  were acquired through ubs ag 
due to the failure of the auction rate market in early  ubs ag and other major banks entered into discussions with government agencies to provide liquidity to owners of auction rate securities 
in november  we entered into an agreement the agreement with ubs ag which provides us with a no net cost loan up to the par value of eligible ars until june   and us the right to sell these auction rate securities back to ubs ag at par  at our sole discretion  anytime during the period from june  through july   and ubs ag the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on our behalf at par anytime through july  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we elected to measure value of our option to put the securities to ubs ag under the fair value option of sfas no 
 recording income of approximately million pre tax and a corresponding long term asset as of december  simultaneously  we transferred these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading investment securities 
as a result of this transfer  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of approximately million pre tax  reflecting a reversal of the related temporary valuation allowance that was previously recorded in other comprehensive loss 
the recording of this income and the recognition of the other than temporary impairment loss resulted in no material impact to our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of our put option under the agreement with ubs ag will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material net impact to our consolidated statement of operations 
our option to put the securities to ubs ag under the agreement will continue to be measured at fair value utilizing level inputs as defined by sfas until the earlier of its maturity or exercise 
the fair values of our auction rate securities are estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other types of valuation models as of december  rather than at par 
these analyses are highly judgmental and consider  among other items  the likelihood of redemption  credit quality  duration  insurance wraps and expected future cash flows 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us 
any changes in fair value for our auction rate securities  which we attribute to market liquidity issues rather than credit issues  are recorded in our statement of operations 

table of contents accounting for share based compensation we use a black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of our share based awards 
the calculation of the fair value of the awards using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate each year during the expected life of the award and is based on a weighted average of peer companies  comparable indices and our stock volatility 
an increase in the volatility would result in an increase in our expense 
the expected term represents the period of time that awards granted are expected to be outstanding and is currently based upon an average of the contractual life and the vesting period of the options 
with the passage of time actual behavioral patterns surrounding the expected term will replace the current methodology 
changes in the future exercise behavior of employees or in the vesting period of the award could result in a change in the expected term 
an increase in the expected term would result in an increase to our expense 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at time of grant 
an increase in the risk free interest rate would result in an increase in our expense 
the estimated forfeiture rate is the rate at which awards are expected to expire before they become fully vested and exercisable 
an increase in the forfeiture rate would result in a decrease to our expense 
share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the number of awards that are expected to vest 
in determining the share based compensation expense to be recognized  a forfeiture rate is applied to the fair value of the award 
this rate represents the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited prior to vesting and is based on our historical employee behavior 
changes in the future behavior of employees could impact this rate 
a decrease in this rate would result in an increase in our expense 
in certain instances where market based  performance share awards are granted  we use the monte carlo valuation model to calculate the fair value 
this approach utilizes a two stage process  which first simulates potential outcomes for our shares using the monte carlo simulation and then employs the black scholes model to value the various outcomes predicted by the monte carlo simulation 
the resulting fair value  on the date of the grant measurement date  is being recognized over the vesting period using the straight line method 
the stage one monte carlo simulation requires a variety of assumptions about both the statistical properties of the company s shares as well as potential reactions to such share price movements by company management 
such assumptions include the natural logarithm of the company s stock price  a random log difference using the russell stock index and a random variable using the specific deviations of the company s returns relative to the returns dictated by the capm model 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas no 
 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is evaluated quarterly by assessing the valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we have used tax planning strategies to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in 
table of contents order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in each jurisdiction 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all periods 
self insurance we are self insured for the majority of our health insurance costs  including claims filed and claims incurred but not reported subject to certain stop loss provisions 
we estimate our liability based upon management s judgment and historical experience 
we also rely on the advice of consulting administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
as of december  and  self insurance accruals totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
we continuously review the adequacy of our insurance coverage 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of insurance expense if actual experience differs significantly from management s estimates 
consolidated results of operations and geographic information consolidated historical results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated historical results of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated

table of contents geographic information the following table summarizes the distribution of revenue by geographic region as determined by billing addresses for each of the periods shown for the year ended december  united states united kingdom and the netherlands other european germany canada africa  asia pacific  middle east and other total revenue comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenue increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our subscription revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  subscription revenue represented approximately of our total revenue for the year ended december  compared to of our total revenue for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is attributable primarily to an increase in sales volumes of our talent management solutions and the continued acceptance of our on demand model 
revenue generated by quorum comprised approximately of the increase in our total revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our other revenue increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was mostly due to an increase in demand for our consulting services which resulted from an increase in our subscription based revenues 
based upon the current market conditions  we expect subscription based and other revenues to decrease in over the prior year due to a greater number of customers delaying or looking to revise the terms and conditions of our service agreements  the strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies of countries in which we do business  the loss of rpo customers  and a loss of consulting engagements 
cost of revenues cost of revenue increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million increase in the cost of revenue was primarily due to increased salaries  overhead  direct costs and other expense of million  million  million and million  respectively 
our increased salaries were due in part to the addition of employees from the acquisition of quorum in as our overall revenue begins to decline  we expect our cost of revenue will decline proportionately  subject to pricing pressure related to economic conditions and slightly influenced by the mix of services and software 
to the extent new customers are added  we expect that the cost of services  as a percentage of revenue  will be greater than those services associated with existing customers 
sales and marketing s m s m expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due in part to an increase of staff related expense of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in performance

the net million increase in salaries was due partially to the addition of employees from our quorum acquisition and employees hired for our existing business in in addition  reserve for bad debt and advertising and marketing expense contributed approximately million and million to the increase in s m expense for the year ended december  over the prior year 
the increase in bad debt was mainly attributed to three customers 
as a percentage of total revenue  s m expense increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to increased expense 
in the future  we intend to continue to invest in s m to pursue new clients and expand relationships with existing clients at levels we deem appropriate given our current economic conditions 
although our s m expense increased in both absolute terms and as a percentage of total revenue  we expect our s m expense to decrease  mainly due to reduced commission expense partially offset by increased branding expense  as business conditions dictate 
general and administrative g a g a expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due in part to an increase in professional fees  rent and utilities expense  and share based compensation expense which contributed million  million  and million  respectively  to the increase in g a expense for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
in addition increased travel  phone and license expense contributed approximately million  million and million in expense for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the remainder of the increase of million was attributable to increases in infrastructure expenses such as supplies  insurance and other expenses of million and salary and bonus expenses of million 
as a percentage of total revenue  g a expense increased by to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  based upon the current economic environment  we believe that g a expenses will decrease in dollar amount and increase as a percentage of total revenue in research and development r d r d expense decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in r d expense was directly attributable to increased capitalized software development costs during capitalized software development costs increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in capitalized software development costs represents and of r d expense for the years ended december  and  respectively and was directly attributable to an increase in the software development projects qualifying for capitalization  pursuant to sop this increase was due in part to greater use of third party software developers and improved precision of their time and activity reporting 
as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expense decreased from to for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to increased capitalized software development costs 
a small portion of our r d expense relates to the efforts of our kenexa research institute scientists  which is more fixed in nature 
this cost structure will result in future r d expense being more constant and also a greater percentage of revenue as our revenue decreases 
we expect r d expenses to remain flat or increase slightly as we continue to execute on our strategies which include furthering the common services enterprise architecture  introducing kenexa x modules  and continuing to develop feature enhancements 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due in part to increased amortization expense associated with our recent acquisitions and increased depreciation expense associated with our capitalized software and our capital purchases including our building in vizag 
in the future  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase due to recent capital purchases 

table of contents restructuring expense during the quarter ended december  in response to the weakness of our macroeconomic environment and widespread deterioration in our business climate we announced a restructuring program involving staff reductions of approximately of our workforce which included one time severance and outplacement benefits totaling approximately million 
in the future  additional staff reductions or other cost saving measures will be considered to further align our cost structure for lower anticipated revenues 
goodwill impairment during the quarter ended december   due to adverse changes in the economic climate  a decline in the our market capitalization from september   and a downward revision in our earnings guidance for the quarter and year ended december   we reevaluated our goodwill impairment analysis 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  these factors signaled a triggering event  which requires us to determine whether and to what extent our goodwill may have been impaired as of december  the first step of this analysis requires the estimation of our fair value  as an entity  and is calculated based on the observable market capitalization with a range of estimated control premiums as well as discounted future estimated cash flows 
this step yielded an estimated fair value for us which was less than our carrying value including goodwill at december  the next step entails performing an analysis to determine whether the carrying amount of goodwill on our balance sheet exceeds our implied fair value 
the implied fair value of our goodwill  for this step was determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination 
our estimated fair value was allocated to our assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized identifiable intangible assets  as if we had been acquired in a business combination with our estimated fair value representing the price paid to acquire it 
the allocation process performed on the test date was only for purposes of determining the implied fair value of goodwill with neither the write up or write down of any assets or liabilities  nor recording any additional unrecognized identifiable intangible assets as part of this process  but did cause us to be out of compliance with the covenants under our credit facility pursuant as of december  based on the analysis  we determined that the implied fair value of the kenexa s goodwill was million  resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million 
the goodwill impairment charge had no effect on our cash balances 
interest income interest income decreased million or for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million decrease is due primarily to lower cash balances and lower rates of interest in income tax expense an income tax benefit on continuing operations of million was recorded for the year ended december  as compared with an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  this income tax benefit is primarily attributable to the recognition of a deferred tax asset of million relating to a goodwill impairment loss that is deductible for us tax purposes 
changes to deferred income taxes are generally based on management s evaluation of our positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its deferred tax assets and the determination that it is more likely than not that we will realize a portion of the benefits of federal and state tax assets 
webhire  which we acquired in january  had a net operating loss carryforward balance of approximately million for federal purposes as of september  brassring  which we acquired in november  had a net operating loss carryforward balance of approximately million for federal purposes as of december  based upon the uncertainty of our ability to utilize these acquired net operating losses  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million during the year ended december  
table of contents during the year ended december   webhire and brassring made retroactive elections under section g of the internal revenue code with the effect of increasing the tax basis of acquired intangible assets to the deemed purchase price of these assets 
we will amortize the increased tax basis of acquired intangibles over a year period for federal and state income tax purposes 
separate gains equal to the respective increases in tax basis were included in the pre acquisition taxable incomes of each acquired company 
webhire and brassring each had sufficient net operating loss carryforwards to fully offset the income recognized on the deemed sale of assets for regular federal income tax purposes 
however  under the federal alternative minimum tax rules  net operating loss carryforwards may not offset more than of income taxable under this measure 
we have therefore paid alternative minimum tax on these gains of approximately million 
concurrent with the recognition of these gains  certain of the acquired net operating losses were deemed to expire 
accordingly  we have reduced the deferred tax assets associated with these acquired net operating losses and the related valuation allowances by offsetting amounts of approximately million

the acquisitions of hrc and straightsource comprised approximately of the increase in our total revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year

liquidity and capital resources since we were formed in  we have financed our operations primarily through internally generated cash flows  our revolving credit facilities and the issuance of equity 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
in addition  we had no debt and approximately million in capital equipment leases 
our cash provided from operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in and provided by financing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all of these effects in resulted in a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  while our investing and financing activities have been significant over the past three years  we expect positive cash flow from operations to continue in future periods 
as of december   we held auction rate securities with a fair value of million and par value of million 
our auction rate securities portfolio includes solely aa and aaa rated investments  comprised of federally insured student loans 
however  the auction rate securities we hold have failed to trade at recent auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
this limits the short term liquidity of these instruments and may limit our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our auction rate securities if we needed to convert some or all to cash in the near term 
we believe that based upon our current other cash and cash equivalent balances  the current lack of liquidity in the auction rate securities market will not have a material impact on our liquidity or our ability to fund our operations 
our auction rate securities were acquired through ubs ag 
due to the failure of the auction rate market in early  ubs and other major banks entered into agreements with governmental agencies to provide liquidity to owners of auction rate securities 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs which provides to us a no net cost loan up to the par value of eligible ars until june   and the right to sell these auction rate securities back to ubs ag at par  at our sole discretion  anytime during the period from june  through july   and ubs ag the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell them on the our behalf at par anytime through july  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information 
as of december  as a result of our goodwill impairment charge for the year then ended  we are no longer in compliance with certain financial covenants under our current line of credit 
we are currently evaluating the cost of a waiver agreement and are considering renegotiating the credit facility for an additional term 
if we are unable to negotiate a satisfactory agreement for the credit facility waiver  we will lose our credit facility and all access to previously available credit from the facility 
this could negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity 
although  in the intermediate term  our liquidity was adversely affected by the downturn in the credit markets and our credit facility may be affected by our non cash goodwill impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter  we believe that the ubs settlement agreement for our auction rate securities and our projected cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months

we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating requirements in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
changes in our operating plans  lower than anticipated revenue  increased expenses or other events  may cause us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and consolidated results of operations 
additional equity financing would be dilutive to the holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate our business

based upon current market conditions  we expect subscription based and other revenues to decrease in over the prior year due to a greater number of customers delaying or revising the terms and conditions of our service agreements  the strengthening us dollar  the loss of rpo customers  and a loss of consulting engagements 
cost of revenues cost of revenue for the quarters presented has fluctuated between and based on the mix of sales between subscription revenue and other revenue 
cost of revenue was highest as a percentage of total revenue for the three months ended december  as our overall revenue begins to decline  we expect our cost of revenue to decline proportionately  subject to pricing pressure related to economic conditions and slightly influenced by the mix of services and software 
to the extent new customers are added  the cost of services  as a percentage of revenue  will be greater than those services associated with existing customers 
sales and marketing following our acquisitions in and sales and marketing increased slightly from approximately to of our total revenues for those periods

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions recognized in financial statements and requires the impact of a tax position to be recognized in the financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained by the taxing authority 
as of december  and december   we had an insignificant amount of unrecognized tax benefits  none of which would materially affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
we do not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
the amount of interest and penalties for the year ended december  was insignificant 
tax years beginning in are subject to examination by taxing authorities  although net operating loss and credit carryforwards from all years are subject to examinations and adjustments for at least three years following the year in which the attributes are used 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under sfas no 
 fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk in  approximately of our total revenue was comprised of sales to clients in the united states 
a key component of our business strategy is to expand our international sales efforts  which will expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
a increase in the value of the us dollar during  relative to each of our non us generated sales would have resulted in reduced annual revenues of approximately for the year ended december  the financial position and operating results of our foreign operations are consolidated using the local currency as the functional currency 
local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange to the us dollar on the balance sheet date  and the local currency revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange to the us dollar during the period 
the related translation adjustments to shareholders equity were a decrease of million and an increase of million during and  respectively  and are included in other comprehensive income 
the foreign currency translation adjustment is not adjusted for income taxes as it relates to an indefinite investment in a non us subsidiary 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
our cash equivalents  which consist solely of money market funds  are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we believe that a change in interest rates would not have a significant effect on our interest income for the year ended december
