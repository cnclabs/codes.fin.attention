item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and the accompanying financial statements and notes related thereto that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
it includes forward looking statements that may reflect our estimates  beliefs  plans and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are based upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  economic conditions  competitive conditions  development success rates  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  including in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
as a result of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the forward looking matters discussed may not occur 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration and development of domestic onshore oil and natural gas reserves 
we focus our efforts primarily on our waterflood oil recovery programs and horizontal drilling in the wilmington field within the los angeles basin of california and on the exploration and development of coalbed methane cbm properties located in the rocky mountain region 
as of december   we owned natural gas and oil leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres  approximately of which are undeveloped 
substantially all our undeveloped acreage is located in the rocky mountains 
our total net proved reserves are located on less than of our net acreage 
from our inception in through  we functioned principally as the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs and joint ventures 
under these programs  we contributed drilling locations  paid tangible drilling costs and provided turnkey drilling services  natural gas marketing services and well services to the drilling programs and the company retained an interest in the wells 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue was attributable to these turnkey drilling services 
after our initial public offering in  the company has transitioned from being the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs to becoming a more traditional exploration and production company 
during the second quarter of  the company changed its accounting method for oil and gas properties from the successful efforts method to the full cost method 
as a result of this accounting change  turnkey profit  well services profit and marketing profit are not recognized on the statement of operations but are recorded as reductions to the full cost pool 
all historical information included in this form k has been retroactively restated to give effect to the change in accounting method 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased million during to million at december  this resulted from cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million 
this was partially offset by cash used in investing activities of million 
cash used in investing activities was primarily spent on oil and gas properties and equipment 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated by oil and gas operations 
cash provided by financing activities primarily represents proceeds received under our credit facility as discussed in more detail below 
the company recorded an impairment expense of million at december  relating to its ceiling test on the carrying costs of its oil and gas properties and goodwill impairments 
this resulted primarily from realized oil prices decreasing from at december  to 
table of contents at december  as a result  many of our proved undeveloped reserves became uneconomic at this oil price 
additionally  the company wrote off approximately million of goodwill 
this goodwill resulted from the acquisition of our wholly owned subsidiary warren e p in and was allocated to our oil and gas operations reporting unit 
the methodology for testing the carrying value of goodwill was by comparing the market value of the company to the net assets of the company 
as a result of a significant decline in the market value of the company in the fourth quarter of  it has been determined that an impairment of this goodwill has occurred 
on november   warren entered into a five year  million credit agreement with merrill lynch capital on behalf of itself and a syndicate of five participating banks the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a revolving loan up to the lesser of i the borrowing base ii million or iii the draw limit requested by the company 
the credit facility matures on november  it is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the borrowing base will be determined by the lenders at least semi annually on april and october of each year  and is based in part on the proved reserves of the company 
interest payments are made quarterly in arrears 
the current borrowing base is million and the overadvance option is million  representing an immediate availability of million 
the overadvance option under the credit facility expires on may  the company is subject to certain covenants required by the credit facility which include  but are not limited to the maintenance of the following financial ratios a minimum current ratio including the unused borrowing base and overadvance option in current assets of not less than to and a minimum annualized consolidated ebitdax as defined by the credit facility to net interest expense of not less than to of to as of december   the company had borrowed million under the credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
if oil and gas commodity prices remain at low levels  the company could be in violation of credit facility covenants during if the company fails to satisfy its credit facility covenants  it would be an event of default 
under such event of default and upon notice  all borrowings would become immediately due and payable to the lending banks 
depending on the current level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate borrowing under the credit facility will be at our option either a the higher of i the agent s prime rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent  plus per annum  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  or b a eurodollar loan rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
during  the company incurred million of interest expense under the credit facility of which approximately million was accrued for as of december  the weighted average interest rate as of december   was 
our operations are affected by local  national and worldwide economic conditions 
we have relied on the capital markets  particularly for equity securities  as well as the banking and debt markets  to meet financial commitments and liquidity needs if internally generated cash flow from operations is not adequate to fund our capital requirements 
capital markets in the united states and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme adverse volatility and disruption for more than months  due in part to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system  the real estate mortgage industry and the financial markets generally 
in recent months  this volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
as a result  our access to capital has become limited 
if oil and gas commodity prices remain at recent low levels or go even lower  the company may not generate sufficient cash flows to cover capital expenditures 
in such case  the availability of funds under our credit facility is critical to our company 
the borrowing base is to be redetermined on or about april  if the credit facility s borrowing base is reduced to a level below current borrowings  the company would be obligated to begin reducing the deficiency by within days after the deficiency occurs and the remaining within days after the deficiency occurs 
additionally  the overadvance option under the credit facility expires on may  
table of contents the continuing crisis in the us and world financial and securities markets could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
additionally  low commodity prices may restrict our ability to meet our current obligations 
as a result  management has taken several actions to ensure that the company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations through december   including a reduction in its capital expenditure budget to million  entered into price swap agreements for a portion of its production to reduce price volatility  temporarily shut in three pilot areas in the atlantic rim that are uneconomic at current prices to reduce lease operating expenses  headcount reductions and reductions in discretionary expenditures  including elimination of year end bonuses 
the company is also evaluating other measures to further improve its liquidity  including  the sale of equity or debt securities  the sale of certain assets  entering into joint ventures with third parties  volumetric production payments  additional commodity price hedging and other monetization of assets strategies 
management believes that these actions will enable the company to meet its liquidity requirements through december  the company has hired outside consultants to assist us in these endeavors 
there is no assurance that the company will be successful in these capital raising efforts that may be necessary to fund operations during in addition to exploring ways to raise capital  as mentioned above  the company is in the process of reducing its general and administrative expenses 
the company plans to accomplish this by reducing the number of its employees and consultants  as well as significantly reducing or eliminating salary increases and cash bonuses 
during the fourth quarter of  operating results declined significantly compared to the first three quarters of primarily  this resulted from the significant decline in oil and gas commodity prices 
additionally during  the company incurred a net loss of million which resulted primarily from impairment charges of million relating to its oil and gas properties and goodwill as compared to net income of million and million for and  respectively 
at december   current assets were approximately million less than current liabilities 
as mentioned previously  the unused availability under the credit facility is added to current assets when calculating the current ratio covenant 
in the future  if natural gas inventories rise to levels such that no natural gas storage capacity exists  certain us natural gas production will need to be reduced or shut in 
additionally  if commodity prices decline to levels that make it uneconomic to produce oil and natural gas  the company or its partners may elect to shut in or reduce production 
as a result  some or all of the company s oil and natural gas production may be shut in or curtailed during the next months  which would have a material adverse effect on operations 
the company s proved reserves declined significantly as of december  compared to prior years and may decline in future years 
due to the current price of oil  compared to the cost of developing our undeveloped oil reserves and our estimated lease operating expenses  a significant portion of our future oil projects are uneconomic at this time 
as a result  a significant portion of our proved undeveloped oil reserves are no longer in the proved category 
the company s projects have material lease operating expenses 
our oil operations include a secondary recovery waterflood with significant fixed costs 
during  our oil lease operating expenses were per barrel of oil produced 
our natural gas operations include reinjecting the produced water into deep formations and compressing and transporting the gas with significant fixed costs 
during  our natural gas lease operating expenses were per mcf of gas produced 
the company s proved reserves are based on 
table of contents assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
the company s proved reserves as of december  through december  are listed below 
years ended december  estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves net natural gas reserves mmcf net oil reserves mbbls total net proved natural gas oil reserves mmcfe estimated present value of net proved reserves pv value in thousands proved developed proved undeveloped total less future income taxes  discounted at standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in thousands prices used in calculating reserves natural gas per mcf oil per bbl proved developed reserves mmcfe capital expenditure program at the present time  we are concentrating our activities in california and wyoming 
we have two california projects in the wilmington field  the wilmington townlot unit and the north wilmington unit 
additionally  we have a drilling project in wyoming referred to as the atlantic rim project 
as a result of low commodity pricing and limited access to capital  the company is significantly reducing its capital expenditure program 
if the company elects not to participate in drilling activities with its partners  it may lose all or a portion of its mineral leases and rights in certain acreage 
as a result  our proved reserves may decline further 
also  unless we continue to develop our properties  production may decline and  as a result  reserves would decline 
lastly  complex federal  state and local laws and regulations may adversely affect the cost and feasibility of drilling and completion activities 
in our california operations  regulations involving the disposition of produced natural gas associated with oil production resulted in the company voluntarily curtailing oil production and could result in reductions of oil production in the future 
currently our capital expenditures budget is forecasted to be approximately million  million for our california properties and million for our wyoming properties 
however  depending upon economic conditions  oil and gas prices and liquidity issues  our capital expenditures may be reduced to approximately million for we do not believe that such a reduction in capital expenditures would have a material effect on our forecasted production or cash flows 
in wyoming  we are budgeting million for pipelines  compressors and infrastructure costs in our atlantic rim project 
additionally  we are budgeting million to complete wells that were previously drilled in our atlantic rim project during the latter half of in california  we are budgeting approximately million for infrastructure costs in the wtu and nwu and million to recomplete certain wells and return certain wells to production and injection 
the final determination regarding whether to drill and complete the budgeted wells and incur the capital expenditures referred to above is dependent upon many factors including  but not limited to the availability of sufficient capital resources  the ability to acquire proper governmental permits and approvals  and 
table of contents economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling such as prevailing and anticipated crude oil and natural gas prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
a substantial portion of our economic success depends on factors over which we have no control  including natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  and environmental and other regulatory matters 
in our planning process  we focus on maintaining financial flexibility and maintaining a low cost structure in order to reduce our vulnerability to these uncontrollable factors

stock based equity compensation plan information at december   we had approximately million vested outstanding stock options issued under our stock based equity compensation plans 
of the total million outstanding vested options  none had exercise prices below the closing market price of our common stock on december  of

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
below  we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas producing activities we account for our oil and gas activities using the full cost method 
as prescribed by full cost accounting rules  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties as well as other internal costs that can be specifically identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities are also capitalized 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs are depleted on the equivalent 
table of contents unit of production method  based on proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  warren is subject to a limitation on capitalized costs 
the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties as adjusted for related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
warren recorded a million ceiling test adjustment to earnings at december  the costs of certain unevaluated oil and gas properties and exploratory wells being drilled are not included in the costs subject to amortization 
warren assesses costs not being amortized for possible impairments or reductions in value and if a reduction in value has occurred  the portion of the carrying cost in excess of the current value is transferred to costs subject to amortization 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows are derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines by an independent engineering firm based in part on data provided by us 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates depends in part on the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
revenue recognition oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by us in various oil and gas properties 
sales of natural gas and oil produced are recognized when delivered to or picked up by the purchaser 
warren accrues for revenue based on estimated pricing and production 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we implemented financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we elected to implement this statement with the one year deferral permitted by fasb staff position fsp for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value  except those that are recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis at least annually 
the deferral applies to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in a business combination  impaired properties  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill  and initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and restructuring costs for which we use fair value 
there was no significant impact to our consolidated financial statements when we implemented sfas no 
for these financial assets and liabilities and we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement permits the election to carry financial instruments and certain other items similar to financial instruments at fair value on the balance sheet  with all changes in fair value reported in earnings 
by electing the fair value option in conjunction with a derivative  an entity can achieve an accounting result similar to a fair value hedge without having to comply with complex hedge accounting rules 
we 
table of contents adopted this statement effective january  during the first quarter of  we did not make the fair value election for any financial instruments not already carried at fair value in accordance with other accounting standards  so the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
the fasb revised sfas no 
revised business combinations sfas r in the revision broadens the application of sfas to cover all transactions and events in which an entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  an entity may not apply it before that date 
warren does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have an impact on the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb sfas 
sfas clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest  and requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of income  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
warren does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have an impact on the financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  that requires new and expanded disclosures regarding hedging activities 
these disclosures include  but are not limited to  a proscribed tabular presentation of derivative data  financial statement presentation of fair values on a gross basis  including those that currently qualify for netting under fasb interpretation no 
 and specific footnote narrative regarding how and why derivatives are used 
the disclosures are required in all interim and annual reports 
sfas is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after november  warren does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have an impact on the financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  which has been established by the fasb as a framework for entities to identify the sources of accounting principles and for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with us gaap 
sfas no 
is effective days following the securities and exchange commission s sec approval of the public company accounting oversight board s pcaob amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  the company will adopt sfas no 
within the required period 
warren does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have an impact on the financial statements 
on december   the sec published a final rule to revise its oil and gas reserves estimation and disclosure requirements 
the primary objectives of the revisions are to increase the transparency and information value of reserve disclosures and improve comparability among oil and gas companies 
the rule is effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  the company anticipates that the implementation of the new rule will provide a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
the new disclosure requirements include consideration of new technologies in evaluating oil and natural gas reserves  disclosure of probable and possible oil and natural gas reserves  use of an average price based on the prior twelve month period rather than year end prices  and revisions of the oil and natural gas disclosure requirements for operations 
the company anticipates that the implementation of the new rule will provide a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the new reporting requirements will have on the financial statements

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity risk our primary market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot regional market prices applicable to our us natural gas production 
pricing for natural gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control  including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price 
in we entered into several financial derivative swap contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production 
through a price swap  we have fixed the price we will receive on a portion of our natural gas and oil production
