net sales of airframe components for small aircraft increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for small aircraft  which consist primarily of business and regional jets  as well as military transport and surveillance aircraft  increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of airframe components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal net sales of turbine engine components for large aircraft decreased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal commercial product sales and other revenues were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in net sales of airframe and turbine engine components for large aircraft is primarily attributable to the overall weak global economic conditions and the related impact such conditions have had on commercial aviation 
the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components that solely have military applications were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this increase is attributable in part to increased military spending due to ongoing wartime demand such as for additional military helicopters and related replacement components 
the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was million related to the payment to a customer that i was made to achieve an amicable business settlement of a product dispute and ii that the company agreed to make as a business gesture of good faith and cooperation without admission of liability 
the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales 
the remaining million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal was principally due to a million decrease in variable selling cost principally due to the decrease in net sales 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the acm group recorded million of expense related the impairment of a long lived asset 
the acm group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal operating results in fiscal were favorably impacted by i an approximate million reduction in the lifo expense in fiscal  compared with fiscal  ii lower expenditures for natural gas principally due to lower consumption and iii the negative impact in fiscal  of the aforementioned million settlement expense and million impairment expense 
these improvements were partially offset by the negative impact of i higher manufacturing labor and benefits expense due to higher average levels of employment and ii an increase in other manufacturing overhead costs incurred in fiscal  compared with fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group during fiscal  net sales  which consist principally of component repair services including precision component machining and industrial coating for small aerospace turbine engines  decreased to million  compared with million in fiscal the repair group s decrease in net sales is primarily due to the overall weak global economic conditions 
during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the repair group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with an operating loss of million in fiscal operating results in fiscal were positively impacted principally by i an increase in selling prices  ii million of income related to the favorable settlements of certain obligations and iii the improved management of operating expenses  principally labor costs 
although sales volumes were higher in fiscal  operating results were negatively impacted in fiscal by startup costs related to the production launch of a new component repair program 
as discussed in the company s form k filed on january   the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the repair group for the purpose of enhancing shareholder value 
the company is conducting an orderly and comprehensive review and evaluation of strategic alternatives available to it  including a divestiture of the repair group

the asc group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was principally due to a reduction in compensation and benefit related expenses attributable to the elimination of certain positions and the temporary reduction of employee compensation 
the asc group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal this decrease in operating income was principally due to the effect of lower net sales without a corresponding decrease in operating expenses 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the million net decrease in fiscal is principally due to a million decrease in legal and professional expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal this decrease was partially offset by million of depreciation expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to an asset that was classified as held for sale  beginning in fiscal and through the third quarter of 
table of contents fiscal  for which no depreciation expense was required to be recorded while it was classified as held for sale

the acm group s airframe and turbine engine component products have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of airframe and turbine engine components that solely have military applications were million in fiscal  
table of contents compared with million in fiscal this increase is attributable in part to increased military spending due to ongoing wartime demand such as for additional military helicopters and related replacement components 
the acm group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was principally due to a million payment to a customer that was made to achieve an amicable business settlement of a product dispute that originated in fiscal  of which million was expensed in fiscal  and that the company agreed to make as a business gesture of good faith and cooperation without admission of liability 
the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal and were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively 
the remaining million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was principally due to i a million increase in variable selling cost principally due to the increase in net sales  ii a million increase in compensation and related expenses  and iii a million increase in bad debt expense 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the acm group recorded million of expense related the impairment of a long lived asset 
the acm group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal included in the million of operating income in fiscal were the aforementioned million of expenses related to the amicable business settlement of a product dispute and the impairment of a long lived asset 
the million of operating income in fiscal  before these million of expenses  reflected an improvement relative to fiscal principally due to the positive impact on margins resulting from higher production and sales volumes in the fiscal  which allowed the acm group to leverage its fixed operating cost structure over more units of production and sales 
the positive impact of the improved leverage of its fixed operating cost were partially offset by the negative impact of i a million increase in the lifo provision and ii higher variable labor costs recognized in fiscal  compared to fiscal turbine component services and repair group repair group during fiscal  net sales  which consist principally of component repair services including precision component machining and industrial coating for small aerospace turbine engines  increased to million  compared with million in fiscal during fiscal  the repair group s selling  general and administrative expenses from continuing operations were million  or of net sales  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal included in selling  general and administrative expenses during both fiscal and was million of bad debt recoveries and  therefore  the remaining selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  during such periods  respectively 
the repair group s operating results from continuing operations were a loss of million in fiscal  compared with income of million in fiscal included in the million operating loss during fiscal were i the aforementioned million of bad debt recovery  ii million of income from the sale of previously reserved inventory  and iii million of income related to the renegotiation of a vendor obligation 
despite these favorable items  the reason that operating results did not improve with the higher volumes during fiscal is due principally to startup costs related to the production launch of a new component repair program and a change in product sales mix to less favorable margin products 
applied surface concepts group asc group net sales increased to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  product net sales  consisting of selective electrochemical metal finishing equipment and solutions  increased million to million  compared with million in fiscal in fiscal  customized selective electrochemical metal finishing contract service net sales increased million to million  compared with million in fiscal a portion of the asc group s business is conducted in europe and is denominated in local european currencies  which have strengthened in relation to the us dollar resulting in a favorable currency impact on net sales in fiscal of approximately million 
the asc group s selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was principally due to a reduction in compensation and benefit related 
table of contents expenses attributable to certain salaried support positions that have either been eliminated or  if not eliminated  have not yet been replaced 
the asc group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal this million increase in operating income is principally due to i a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses discussed above and ii improved operating margins due to higher sales 
these gains were partially offset by i rising precious metals commodity costs that could not be fully passed on to customers and ii higher compensation expense due to the hiring of additional operations personnel 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other corporate expenses  were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the million increase in fiscal is principally due to an increase in legal and professional expenses related to i the company s long term strategic planning efforts  including its incentive compensation planning  ii its efforts required to achieve initial sarbanes oxley compliance in fiscal  and iii professional tax consulting services 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in incentive expense 
other general interest expense from continuing operations was million and million in fiscal and  respectively

the company s operating activities provided million of cash of which million was provided by continuing operations in fiscal  compared with million of cash provided by operating activities of which million was provided by continuing operations in fiscal the million of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to i million of net income  ii the impact of such non cash items as depreciation expense  deferred taxes and lifo income  iii a million decrease in inventory  iv a million decrease in accounts receivable  and v a million decrease in refundable income taxes 
these sources of cash were offset principally by i a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and ii a million decrease in other long term liabilities 
the changes in the components of working capital were due to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including i the acm group s successful efforts to further improve the optimization of its inventory levels  ii the relative timing of collections from customers being impacted by the current global economic climate and iii the relative timing of payments to suppliers and tax authorities 
the change in other long term liabilities is principally attributable to pension contributions for us defined benefit pension plans 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared with in fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal consist of million by the acm group  million by the asc group and million by the repair group 
included in the million is million for the initial implementation of a new company wide management information system 
in addition to the million expended during fiscal  million has been committed as of september  
table of contents  which includes million for the further implementation of the new company wide management information system 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures will be within the range of to million in fiscal to support the projected growth in the company s businesses 
at september   the company had an million revolving credit agreement with a bank  subject to sufficiency of collateral  which expires on october  and bears interest at the bank s base rate 
the interest rate was at september  a commitment fee is incurred on the unused balance of the revolving credit agreement 
at september   no amount was outstanding and the company had million available under its million revolving credit agreement 
the company s revolving credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets located in the us and a guarantee by its us subsidiaries 
under its revolving credit agreement with the bank  the company is subject to certain customary covenants 
these include  without limitation  covenants as defined that require maintenance of certain specified financial ratios  including a minimum tangible net worth level and a minimum ebitda level 
the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  the company believes that cash flows from its operations together with existing cash reserves and the funds available under its revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements through the end of fiscal year c 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

the company is expected to fund approximately million of pension obligations in fiscal e 
outlook the company s repair and acm groups businesses continue to be heavily dependent upon the strength of the commercial airlines as well as aircraft and related engine manufacturers 
consequently  the performance of the domestic and international air transport industry directly and significantly impacts the performance of the repair and acm groups businesses 
the financial condition of many airlines in the us and throughout the world  while showing improvement  continues to be weak 
some airlines have received us government assistance and or have proceeded through the bankruptcy reorganization process  while others continue to pursue major restructuring initiatives  all of which appear to have had some positive impact on operating results in recent periods 
modest improvements in the commercial airlines and the relatively stable to slightly declining demand in the commercial aircraft and related engine industries have been complemented by 
table of contents relatively strong us military spending for aircraft and related components 
the air transport industry s long term outlook is for continued  steady growth 
such longer term outlook suggests the need for additional aircraft and  therefore  growth in the requirement for airframe and engine components as well as aerospace turbine engine repairs 
although the air transport industry has recently benefited from several favorable trends  including i projected growth in air traffic  ii major replacement and refurbishment cycles driven by the desire for more fuel efficient aircraft and fleet commonality  and iii the increased use of wide body aircraft  this is changing 
the current global economic downturn has created significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit 
therefore  this downturn has adversely affected the ability of the company s customers to fulfill their purchase commitments on a timely basis and  as such  the level of the company s business 
certain of the company s customers have recently extended delayed their required delivery schedules  in particular those customers in the commercial sector of the market 
a continued deterioration in the global economy could result in further reduced demand for the products and services that the company provides 
the company supplies new and spare components for military aircraft 
as a result of continued military initiatives  there has been increased demand for both new and spare components for military customers 
the company s current outlook for the air transport industry is cautiously optimistic while the military segment remains stable  and the company does believe that it is poised to take advantage of the resulting improvement in order demand from the commercial airframe and engine manufacturers if and when it may occur 
it is difficult to determine  at this time  the potential long term impact that the aforementioned factors may have on air travel and the demand for the products and services provided by the company 
lack of continued improvement could result in credit risk associated with serving the financially troubled airlines and or their suppliers 
all of these consequences  to the extent that they may occur  could negatively impact the company s net sales  operating profits and cash flows 
however  in light of the current business environment  the company believes that cash on hand  funds available under its revolving credit agreement  and anticipated funds generated from operations will be adequate to meet its liquidity needs through the foreseeable future 
f 
critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
as these factors change  the company s allowances for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent periods 
historically  losses have been within management s expectations and have not been significant 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
management s judgment is necessary in determining the realizable value of these products to arrive at the proper allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review involves judgment and is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets and which the company considers a critical accounting estimate 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  and if such excess carrying value is determined to be permanent  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value  which could result in future impairment charges 
defined benefit pension plan expense the company maintains three defined benefit pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under these three defined benefit pension plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing various assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions elements associated with these defined benefit pension plans 
one significant assumption in determining net pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
the company determines the expected return on plan assets principally based on i the expected return for the various asset classes in the respective plans investment portfolios and ii the targeted allocation of the respective plans assets 
the expected return on plan assets is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current and anticipated market conditions such as inflation  interest rates and market performance 
should the actual rate of return differ materially from the assumed expected rate  the company could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of its plans and  accordingly  on its related future net pension expense 
another significant assumption in determining the net pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rate for each plan is determined  as of the fiscal year end measurement date  using prevailing market spot rates from an appropriate yield curve with maturities corresponding to the expected timing date of the future defined benefit payment amounts for each of the respective plans 
such corresponding spot rates are used to discount future years projected defined benefit payment amounts back to the fiscal year end measurement date as a present value 
a composite discount rate is then developed for each plan by determining the single rate of discount that will produce the same present value as that obtained by applying the annual spot rates 
the discount rate may be further revised if the market environment indicates that the above methodology generates a discount rate that does not accurately reflect the prevailing interest rates as of the fiscal year end measurement date deferred tax valuation allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance related to accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
at september  and  the company s net deferred tax liability before any valuation allowance was a nominal amount and million  respectively 
g 
impact of newly issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 income taxes  which provided implementation guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and disclosure amendments for nonpublic entities 
the adoption of the implementation guidance will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and disclosures 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which launched the accounting standards codification codification  which established a two level gaap hierarchy for nongovernmental entities authoritative guidance and non authoritative guidance 
the codification is now the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap in the united states 
all guidance in the codification carries an equal level of authority 
rules and interpretive releases of the united states securities and exchange commission sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
subsequent revisions to gaap will be incorporated into the codification through accounting standards updates 
other than the manner in which new accounting guidance is referenced  the adoption of these changes had no impact to the financial statements of the company 
in may  the fasb issued guidance related to changes to accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued  otherwise known as subsequent events 
in particular  these changes set forth i the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur  ii the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and iii the disclosures that an entity should make 
table of contents about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
this guidance introduces the concept of financial statements being available to be issued 
it requires the disclosure of i the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and ii the basis for that date  that is  whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or were available to be issued 
this guidance should not result in significant changes in the subsequent events that an entity reports in its financial statements and does not apply to subsequent events or transactions that are within the scope of other applicable generally accepted accounting principles that provide different guidance on the accounting treatment for subsequent events or transactions 
the adoption of these changes had no significant impact to the financial statements of the company 
in december  the fasb issued guidance related to employers disclosure about postretirement benefit plan assets 
such disclosures should provide users of financial statements with an understanding of i how investment allocation decisions are made  ii major categories of plan assets  iii how fair value of plan assets are measured  iv the effect of fair value measurements on changes in plan assets during a period and v significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
the requirements of this new disclosure about plan assets shall be provided for fiscal years ending after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to foreign currency and interest rate risk 
the risks primarily relate to the sale of the company s products in transactions denominated in non us dollar currencies the euro  pound sterling and the swedish krona  the payment in local currency of wages and other costs related to the company s non us operations  and changes in interest rates on the company s long term debt obligations 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
a 
foreign currency risk the us dollar is the functional currency for all of the company s us operations 
for these operations  all gains and losses from completed currency transactions are included in income currently 
for the company s non us subsidiaries  the functional currency is the local currency 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange at the end of the period and revenues and expenses are translated using average rates of exchange 
foreign currency translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
historically  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of foreign currency risk by means of hedging such risk through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts  which typically expire within one year 
however  such risk is mitigated only for the periods for which the company has foreign currency exchange contracts in effect  and only to the extent of the us dollar amounts of such contracts 
at september   the company had no forward exchange contracts outstanding 
the company will continue to evaluate its foreign currency risk  if any  and the effectiveness of using similar hedges in the future to mitigate such risk 
at september   the company s assets and liabilities denominated in the pound sterling  the euro and swedish krona were as follows amounts in thousands pound sterling euro swedish krona cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities b 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the variable interest rate mechanisms associated with the company s long term debt consisting of a revolving credit agreement with a bank 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the september  rate  and assuming no change in the amount outstanding under the revolving credit agreement  annual interest expense to the company would be nominally impacted 
the company s sensitivity analyses of the effects of changes in interest rates do not consider the impact of a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevail 
at september   the company is not a party to any hedging or other interest rate risk management agreements
