item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development and commercialization of innovative therapeutic products to treat the unmet medical needs of patients with debilitating conditions and life threatening diseases 
our principal programs are directed toward supportive care  virology and oncology 
we commenced principal operations in  became publicly traded in and throughout have been engaged primarily in research and development efforts  developing manufacturing capabilities  establishing corporate collaborations and raising capital 
we have only recently begun to derive revenue from a commercial product 
in order to commercialize the principal products that we have under development  we have been and continue to address a number of technological and clinical challenges and comply with comprehensive us and us regulatory requirements 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future  which could increase significantly as we expand our clinical trial programs and other product development efforts 
our sources of revenues through december  have been payments under our current and former collaboration agreements  from psma llc  from research grants and contracts from the nih related to our cancer and virology programs  from interest income and royalties 
beginning in january  we have been recognizing revenues from wyeth for reimbursement of our development expenses for relistor as incurred  for the million upfront payment we received from wyeth over the period of our development obligations and for any milestones or contingent events that are achieved during our collaboration with wyeth 
we have not recognized revenue from psma llc for the years ended december   or  since during  prior to our acquisition of our former partner s membership interest in psma llc on april   the partners had not approved a work plan and budget for and subsequently psma llc has become our wholly owned subsidiary 
to date  our product sales have consisted solely of limited revenues from the sale of research reagents 
we expect that sales of research reagents in the future will not significantly increase over current levels 
a majority of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities 
during  expenses for our hiv research program have increased significantly over those in and while expenses for our relistor and cancer research programs declined compared to and we expect our expenses for relistor will decline in and thereafter  which will result in less reimbursement revenues from wyeth 
we expect to incur significant development expenses for our other programs as these programs progress 
a portion of these expenses is reimbursed through government funding 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
we expect that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund operations at current levels beyond one year 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
we have had recurring losses and had  at december   an accumulated deficit of million 
during the year ended december   we had a net loss of million 
our most recent public offering of common stock occurred during the year ended december   and we received net proceeds of million 
other than potential revenues from relistor  which we expect to decline  we do not anticipate generating significant recurring revenues  from royalties  product sales or otherwise  in the near term  and we expect to incur significant expenses 
consequently  we may require significant additional external funding to continue our operations at their current levels in the future 
such funding may be derived from additional collaboration or licensing agreements with pharmaceutical or other companies or from the sale of our common stock or other securities to investors or government funding  but may also not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
supportive care 
our first commercial product  relistor  was approved by the fda for sale in the united states in april our collaboration partner  wyeth pharmaceuticals  commenced sales of relistor subcutaneous injection in june  and we have begun earning royalties on world wide sales 
regulatory approvals have also been obtained in canada  the european union  australia and venezuela  and marketing applications have been approved or are pending or scheduled in other countries 
in october  we out licensed to ono pharmaceutical co  ltd  osaka  japan  the rights to subcutaneous relistor in japan 
we continue development and clinical trials with respect to other indications for relistor 
in january  wyeth and pfizer inc announced a definitive agreement under which pfizer is to acquire wyeth 
we understand that the transaction is currently expected to close in late and is subject to a variety of conditions 
the proposed acquisition of wyeth by pfizer does not trigger any change of control provisions in our collaboration with wyeth  and we believe that if the acquisition occurs  the combined pfizer wyeth organization will continue to have the same rights and responsibilities under the collaboration following the acquisition as wyeth had before 
we cannot  however  predict how a combined pfizer and wyeth may view the utility and attractiveness of our collaboration 
as a result of completion of this proposed acquisition or for other reasons  wyeth or pfizer may change its strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced or delayed revenues to us 
we cannot predict whether a combined pfizer and wyeth will determine to continue  seek to change or terminate our collaboration  or devote the same resources wyeth currently dedicates to it 
if a combined wyeth and pfizer were to terminate the collaboration  we would no longer receive milestone and royalty payments and would need to undertake development and commercialization of relistor ourselves or through another collaboration or licensing arrangement 
we may not learn of their plans for relistor and our collaboration unless and until the proposed transaction closes 

table of contents in  we earned million in milestone payments from wyeth for fda and european approvals of subcutaneous relistor for the advanced illness setting  and in the second quarter of began earning royalties on wyeth s sales of that product 
in april  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program to acquire up to million of our outstanding common shares  funding for which came from the million milestone payment we received from wyeth related to us marketing approval for relistor 
purchases under the program were to be made at our discretion subject to market conditions in the open market or otherwise  and in accordance with the regulations of the sec  including rule b during  we repurchased  of our outstanding common shares 
purchases may be discontinued at any time 
reacquired shares will be held in treasury until redeployed or retired 
we have million remaining available for purchases under the program 
we and wyeth are also developing subcutaneous relistor for treatment of oic outside the advanced illness setting  in individuals with chronic pain not related to cancer  such as severe back pain that requires treatment with opioids a phase trial conducted by wyeth  and in individuals rehabilitating from an orthopedic surgical procedure in whom opioids are used to control post operative pain a hypothesis generating phase trial conducted by us 
we are no longer enrolling patients in this latter trial and are analyzing data from the treated population 
based on positive results from the one month blinded portion of the phase chronic pain study  we and wyeth recently initiated and fda required one year  open label safety study in chronic  non cancer pain patients which is intended to yield a consolidated safety database to enable filing an snda  which is now planned for submission by the end of for treatment of oic in the chronic  non cancer pain population 
we and wyeth also have had in development an intravenous formulation of relistor for the management of poi  a temporary impairment of the gastrointestinal tract function 
results from two phase clinical trials of this formulation showed that treatment did not achieve primary or secondary end points 
recent results from a third phase trial evaluating an intravenous formulation of relistor in patients following abdominal hernia repair have confirmed these earlier findings 
wyeth is leading development of an oral formulation of relistor for the treatment of oic in patients with chronic  non cancer pain 
we and wyeth are evaluating information from optimization studies of a formulation of this product candidate to determine the next stages of development 
development and commercialization of relistor is being conducted under the wyeth collaboration agreement 
under that agreement  we i have received an upfront payment from wyeth  ii have received and are entitled to receive further additional payments as certain developmental milestones for relistor are achieved  iii have been and are entitled to be reimbursed by wyeth for expenses we incur in connection with the development of relistor under an agreed upon development plan and budget  and iv have received and are entitled to receive royalties and commercialization milestone payments 
these payments will depend on continued success in development and commercialization of relistor  which are in turn dependent on the actions of wyeth and the fda and other regulatory bodies  as well as the outcome of clinical and other testing of relistor 
many of these matters are outside our control 
manufacturing and commercialization expenses for relistor are funded by wyeth 
wyeth has elected  as it was entitled to do under the collaboration agreement  not to develop relistor in japan  and as provided in that collaboration agreement returned to us the rights to relistor in japan 
as discussed below  we have out licensed the rights to subcutaneous relistor in japan which we reacquired from wyeth as a result of its election 
at inception of the wyeth collaboration  wyeth paid to us a million non refundable upfront payment 
wyeth has made million in milestone payments since that time and is obligated to make up to million in additional payments to us upon the achievement of milestones and contingent events in the development and commercialization of relistor  taking into account the ono transaction discussed below 
costs for the development of relistor incurred by wyeth or us starting january  are paid by wyeth 
we are being reimbursed for our out of pocket development costs by wyeth and receive reimbursement for our efforts based on the number of our full time equivalent employees devoted to the development project  all subject to wyeth s audit rights and possible reconciliation as provided in the agreement 
during the applicable royalty periods  wyeth is obligated to pay to us royalties on the net sales of relistor by wyeth throughout the world other than japan  where we have licensed the rights to subcutaneous relistor to ono 
in january  we began recognizing revenue from wyeth for reimbursement of our development expenses for relistor as incurred during each quarter under the development plan agreed to by us and wyeth 
we also began recognizing revenue for a portion of the million upfront payment we received from wyeth  based on the proportion of the expected total effort for us to complete our development obligations  as reflected in the most recent development plan and budget approved by us and wyeth  that was actually performed during that quarter 
starting june  we began recognizing royalty income based on the net sales of relistor  as defined  by wyeth 

table of contents in october  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ono under which we licensed to ono the rights to subcutaneous relistor in japan 
under that agreement  in november we received from ono an upfront payment of million  and are entitled to receive potential development milestones of up to million  commercial milestones and royalties on sales by ono of subcutaneous relistor in japan 
these payments will depend on continued success in development and commercialization of relistor  which are in turn dependent on the actions of wyeth  ono  the fda  japanese pharmaceutical regulatory authorities and other regulatory bodies  as well as the outcome of clinical and other testing of relistor 
many of these matters are outside our control 
ono also has the option to acquire from us the rights to develop and commercialize in japan other formulations of relistor  including intravenous and oral forms  on terms to be negotiated separately 
supervision of and consultation with respect to ono s development and commercialization responsibilities will be carried out by joint committees consisting of members from both ono and us 
ono may request us to perform activities related to its development and commercialization responsibilities beyond our participation in these committees and specified technology transfer related tasks which will be at its expense  and payable to us for the services it requests  at the time we perform services for them 
as a result of the return of the japanese rights  we will not receive from wyeth  milestone payments related to the development of relistor formulations in japan 
these potential future milestone payments would have totaled million of which million related to the subcutaneous formulation of relistor and the remainder to the intravenous and oral formulations 
taking these adjustments into account  we now have the potential to receive a total of million in development and commercialization milestone payments from wyeth under the wyeth collaboration of which million relate to the intravenous formulation of relistor  and of which million million relating to the intravenous formulation have been paid to date 
virology 
in the area of virology  we are developing two viral entry inhibitors a humanized monoclonal antibody  pro  for treatment of hiv  the virus that causes aids  and a proprietary orally available small molecule drug candidate  designated pro  for treatment of hcv infection 
we have recently selected for further clinical development the subcutaneous form of pro for treatment of hiv infection  which has the potential for convenient  weekly self administration  and we are conducting preclinical development activities in preparation for filing an ind application for pro we are also engaged in research regarding a prophylactic vaccine against hiv infection 
oncology 
in the area of prostate cancer  we are conducting a phase clinical trial of a fully human monoclonal adc directed against psma  a protein found at high levels on the surface of prostate cancer cells and also on the neovasculature of a number of other types of solid tumors 
we are also developing therapeutic vaccines designed to stimulate an immune response to psma

research revenue from collaborator relates to our collaboration with wyeth 
from the inception of the wyeth collaboration through december  we recognized as revenue i in october   milestone payment in connection with the initiation of the first phase clinical trial of intravenous relistor  ii in may   representing two milestone payments  related to the acceptance for review of applications submitted for marketing approval of a subcutaneous formulation of relistor in the u 
s and european union  iii in april   milestone payment related to the fda approval of subcutaneous relistor and iv in july   milestone payment related to the european approval of subcutaneous formulation of relistor 
we have analyzed the facts and circumstances of the five milestones achieved since inception of the wyeth collaboration through december   and believe that they met those criteria for revenue recognition upon achievement of the respective milestones

from the inception of the wyeth collaboration through december   we recognized  of revenue from the  upfront payment   as reimbursement for our development costs  and a total of  for non refundable milestone payments 
we recognize a portion of the upfront payment in a reporting period in accordance with the proportionate performance method  which is based on the percentage of actual effort performed on our development obligations in that period relative to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement  as reflected in the most recent development plan and budget approved by wyeth and us 
during the third quarter of  a revised budget was approved  which extended our performance period to the end of and  thereby  decreased the amount of revenue we are recognizing in each reporting period 
as a result  the amount of revenue recognized from the upfront payment during the year ended december  declined by  as compared to as of december   relative to the million upfront payment from ono  we have recorded million as deferred revenue current  which we expect to recognize as revenue during the first quarter of  upon satisfaction of our performance obligations

we began earning royalties from net sales by wyeth of subcutaneous relistor in june during the year ended december   we earned royalties of  based on the net sales of relistor and we recognized of royalty income 
as of december   we have recorded a cumulative total of as deferred revenue current 
the of deferred royalty revenue is expected to be recognized as royalty income over the period of our development obligations relating to relistor  which we currently estimate will be in our royalties from net sales by wyeth of relistor  as defined  are based on royalty rates under our collaboration 
these rates can range up to of us and of foreign net sales at the highest sales levels 
royalty rates will increase on incremental sales as net sales in a calendar year exceed specified levels 
research grants and contract 
in  we were awarded a contract nih contract by the nih to develop a prophylactic vaccine provax designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
funding under the nih contract provides for pre clinical research  development and early clinical testing 
these funds are being used principally in connection with our provax hiv vaccine program 
the nih contract originally provided for up to  in funding to us  subject to annual funding approvals and compliance with its terms  over five years 
the total of our approved award under the nih contract through december amounted to  funding under this contract includes the payment of an aggregate of  in fees  subject to achievement of specified milestones 
through december   we had recognized revenue of  from this contract  including for the achievement of two milestones 
we were informed by the nih that it has decided to fund the nih contract only through december we have applied for continued funding for this program and are funding it with our own resources pending a decision on that application 
revenues from research grants and contract from the nih decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december    and  from grants and  and  from the nih contract for the years ended december  and  respectively

at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including non current portion  totaling million compared with million at december  we expect that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  are sufficient to fund current operations beyond one year 
our cash flow from operating activities was negative for the years ended december   and due primarily to the excess of expenditures on our research and development programs and general and administrative costs related to those programs over cash received from collaborators and government grants and contracts to fund such programs  as described below 
sources of cash operating activities 
our collaboration with wyeth provided us with a million upfront payment in december in addition  since january  wyeth has been reimbursing us for development expenses we incur related to relistor under the development plan agreed to between us  which is currently expected to continue through for the years ended december  and  we received million and million  respectively  of such reimbursement 
since inception of the wyeth collaboration  wyeth has made million in milestone payments to us upon the achievement of certain events 
in may  we earned million  representing two milestone payments  related to the acceptance for review of applications submitted for marketing approval of a subcutaneous formulation of relistor for the treatment of oic in patients receiving palliative care in the us and the european union 
approval of the us application in april resulted in our earning a million milestone payment  which was recognized in the second quarter of in july  we earned million milestone payment for the european approval of subcutaneous relistor 
wyeth has also submitted applications for the marketing of relistor in canada and australia  which were approved in march and november  respectively 
in october  we earned a million milestone payment in connection with the start of a phase clinical trial of intravenous relistor for the treatment of poi 
wyeth is obligated to make up to million in additional payments to us upon the achievement of milestones and other contingent events in the development and commercialization of relistor 
wyeth is also responsible for all commercialization activities related to relistor products  other than that to be conducted by ono 
we are entitled to receive royalty payments from wyeth as the product is sold in the various countries other than japan where marketing approval has been obtained 
we are also entitled to receive royalty payments upon the sale of all other products developed under the wyeth collaboration agreement 
under our license agreement with ono  we received from ono an upfront payment of million  and are entitled to receive potential development milestone payments of up to million  commercial milestones and royalties on sales of subcutaneous relistor in japan 
ono is also responsible for development and commercialization costs for subcutaneous relistor in japan 
as of december   relative to the million upfront payment from ono  we have recorded million as deferred revenue current  which we expect to recognize as revenue during the first quarter of  upon satisfaction of our performance obligations 
the funding by wyeth and ono of development costs for relistor generally enhances our ability to devote current and future resources to other research and development programs 
we may also enter into other collaboration agreements  license or sale transactions or royalty sales or financings with respect to our products and product candidates 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty  however  which products or indications  if any  will be subject to future arrangements  or how they would affect our capital requirements 
the consummation of other agreements would further allow us to advance other projects with current funds 
in  we were awarded a contract by the nih to develop a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus 
funding under the nih contract provided for pre clinical research  development and early clinical testing 
these funds are being used principally in connection with our provax hiv vaccine program 
the nih contract originally provided for up to million in funding to us  subject to annual funding approvals and compliance with its terms  over five years 
the total of our approved award under the nih contract through december is million 
funding under this contract includes the payment of an aggregate of million in fees  subject to achievement of specified milestones 
through december   we had recognized revenue of million from this contract  including million for the achievement of two milestones 
we were informed by the nih that it has decided to fund this contract only through december we have applied for continued funding for this program and are funding it with our own resources pending a decision on that application 

table of contents a substantial portion of our revenues to date has been derived from federal government grants and research contracts 
during the years ended december   and  we generated revenues from awards made to us by the nih between and  to partially fund some of our programs 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of revenue from all of our nih grants 
changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable for the years ended december   and resulted from the timing of receipts from the nih and wyeth  and payments made to trade vendors in the normal course of business 
other than amounts to be received from wyeth  ono and from currently approved grants  we have no committed external sources of capital 
other than revenues from relistor  we expect no significant product revenues for a number of years  as it will take at least that much time  if ever  to bring our product candidates to the commercial marketing stage 
investing activities 
we purchase and sell marketable securities in order to provide funding for operations 
our marketable securities  which include corporate debt securities  securities of government sponsored entities and auction rate securities  are classified as available for sale 
a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents are guaranteed by the us treasury or federal deposit insurance corporation s guarantee programs 
our marketable securities  which include corporate debt securities  securities of government sponsored entities and auction rate securities  are classified as available for sale and are predominantly not guaranteed 
these investments  while rated investment grade by the standard poor s and moody s rating agencies and predominantly having scheduled maturities in the first three quarters of  are heavily concentrated in the us financial sector  which continues to be under extreme stress 
as a result of recent changes in general market conditions  we determined to reduce the principal amount of auction rate securities in our portfolio as they came up for auction and invest the proceeds in other securities in accordance with our investment guidelines 
beginning in february  auctions failed for certain of our auction rate securities because sell orders exceeded buy orders 
as a result  at december   we continue to hold approximately million of auction rate securities which  in the event of auction failure  are reset according to the contractual terms in the governing instruments 
to date  we have received all scheduled interest payments on these securities 
the principal amount of these remaining auction rate securities will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid  or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we monitor markets for our investments  but cannot guarantee that additional losses will not be required to be recorded 
valuation of securities is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity and general economic and market conditions 
we do not believe the carrying values of our investments are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 
our marketable securities are purchased and  in the case of auction rate securities  sold by third party brokers in accordance with our investment policy guidelines 
our brokerage account requires that all marketable securities be held to maturity unless authorization is obtained from us to sell earlier 
in fact  we have a history of holding all marketable securities to maturity 
we  therefore  consider that we have the intent and ability to hold any securities with unrealized losses until a recovery of fair value which may be maturity  and we do not consider these marketable securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  financing activities 
during the years ended december   and  we received cash of million  million and million  respectively  from the exercise of stock options by employees  directors and non employee consultants  from the sale of our common stock under our purchase plans and from sale of common stock in public offering in the amount of cash we receive from these sources fluctuates commensurate with headcount levels and changes in the price of our common stock on the grant date for options exercised  and on the sale date for shares sold under the purchase plans 
in  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock  pursuant to a shelf registration statement that had been filed with the sec in  which had registered million shares of our common stock  that registration statement has now expired 
we received proceeds of million  or per share  which was net of underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately million  and paid approximately million in other offering expenses 

table of contents in the past year  we obtained approvals from the fda  as well as european union  canadian  australian  venezuelan and other regulatory authorities  for our first commercial product  relistor 
we continue development and clinical trials with respect to relistor and our other product candidates 
unless we obtain regulatory approval from the fda for additional product candidates and or enter into agreements with corporate collaborators with respect to the development of our technologies in addition to that for relistor  we will be required to fund our operations for periods in the future  by seeking additional financing through future offerings of equity or debt securities or funding from additional grants and government contracts 
adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on terms reasonably acceptable to us would seriously jeopardize the future success of our business 
uses of cash operating activities 
the majority of our cash has been used to advance our research and development programs 
we currently have major research and development programs investigating supportive care  virology and oncology  and are conducting several smaller research projects in the areas of virology and oncology 
our total expenses for research and development from inception through december  have been approximately million 
for various reasons  many of which are outside of our control  including the early stage of certain of our programs  the timing and results of our clinical trials and our dependence in certain instances on third parties  we cannot estimate the total remaining costs to be incurred and timing to complete our research and development programs 
under our collaboration with wyeth  we are able to estimate that those remaining costs for the subcutaneous and intravenous formulations of relistor  based upon the development plan and budget approved by us and wyeth  which may be subject to further revision  are million  over the period from january  to december  for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred  by project  were as follows 
expenses for cancer for include million related to our purchase of a former member s interest in the psma joint venture  see business oncology prostate cancer psma  above for more details for the year ended december  in millions relistor hiv cancer other programs total we may require additional funding to continue our research and product development programs  conduct pre clinical studies and clinical trials  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates  file and prosecute patent applications and enforce or defend patent claims  if any  and fund product in licensing and any possible acquisitions 
manufacturing and commercialization expenses for relistor are funded by wyeth in the us and outside the us except for japan  where development  manufacturing and commercialization expenses are required to be funded by ono 
however  if we exercise our option to co promote relistor products in the us  which must be approved by wyeth  we will be required to establish and fund a sales force  which we currently do not have 
if we commercialize any other product candidate other than with a collaborator  we would also require additional funding to establish manufacturing and marketing capabilities 
our purchase of rights from our methylnaltrexone licensors in december has extinguished our cash payments that would have been due to those licensors in the future upon the achievement of certain events  including sales of relistor products 
we continue  however  to be responsible to make payments including royalties to the university of chicago upon the occurrence of certain events 
costs incurred by psma llc from january  to april  were funded from psma llc s cash reserves 
we are continuing to conduct the psma research and development projects on our own subsequent to our acquisition of psma llc  on april   and are required to fund the entire amount of such efforts  thus  increasing our cash expenditures 
we are funding psma related research and development efforts from our internally generated cash flows 
we are also continuing to receive funding from the nih for a portion of our psma related research and development costs 
investing activities 
during the years ended december   and  we have spent million  million and million  respectively  on capital expenditures 
those expenditures have been related to the expansion of our office  laboratory and manufacturing facilities and the purchase of more laboratory equipment for our ongoing and future research and development projects  including the purchase of a second liter bioreactor in february for the manufacture of research and clinical products 

table of contents contractual obligations our funding requirements  both for the next months and beyond  will include required payments under operating leases and licensing and collaboration agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for future payments under these agreements payments due by december  total thereafter in millions operating leases license and collaboration agreements total assumes attainment of milestones covered under each agreement  including those by psma llc 
the timing of the achievement of the related milestones is highly uncertain  and accordingly the actual timing of payments  if any  is likely to vary  perhaps significantly  relative to the timing contemplated by this table 
we periodically assess the scientific progress and merits of each of our programs to determine if continued research and development is economically viable 
certain of our programs have been terminated due to the lack of scientific progress and prospects for ultimate commercialization 
because of the uncertainties associated with research and development in these programs  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete research and development projects in a timely manner or failure to enter into collaborative agreements could significantly increase capital requirements and adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of results of research and development and product testing  changes in existing relationships or new relationships with licensees  licensors or other collaborators  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims  the regulatory approval process  manufacturing and marketing and other costs associated with the commercialization of products following receipt of regulatory approvals and other factors 
the above discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current operating plan and the assumptions on which it relies 
there could be deviations from that plan that would consume our assets earlier than planned 
off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other unconsolidated entity 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not otherwise readily apparent 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions we use in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome and  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have identified our critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from all sources based on the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and eitf issue no 
eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
our license and co development agreement with wyeth includes a non refundable upfront license fee  reimbursement of development costs  research and development payments based upon our achievement of clinical development milestones  contingent payments based upon the achievement by wyeth of defined events and royalties on product sales 
we began recognizing research revenue from wyeth on january  during the years ended december   and  we also recognized revenue from government research grants and contract  which are used to subsidize a portion of certain of our research projects projects  exclusively from the nih 
we also recognized revenue from the sale of research reagents during those periods 
non refundable upfront license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  such as research and steering or other committee services  can be separated in accordance with eitf we would recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license had standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research or steering or other committee services  could be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations could be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have standalone value  or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations could not be determined  the upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when our performance obligations are performed 
we must determine the period over which our performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents will typically be used as the measure of performance 
under the proportionate performance method  revenue related to upfront license payments is recognized in any period as the percent of actual effort expended in that period relative to total effort for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
we are recognizing revenue related to the upfront license payment we received from wyeth using the proportionate performance method since we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the wyeth collaboration based upon the most current budget approved by both wyeth and us 
such performance obligations are provided by us on a best efforts basis 
full time equivalents are being used as the measure of performance 
significant judgment is required in determining the nature and assignment of tasks to be accomplished by each of the parties and the level of effort required for us to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
the nature and assignment of tasks to be performed by each party involves the preparation  discussion and approval by the parties of a development plan and budget 
since we have no obligation to develop the subcutaneous and intravenous formulations of relistor outside the us or the oral formulation at all and have no significant commercialization obligations for any product  recognition of revenue for the upfront payment is not required during those periods  if they extend beyond the period of our development obligations 
during the course of a collaboration agreement  eg  the wyeth collaboration  that involves a development plan and budget  the amount of the upfront license payment that is recognized as revenue in any period will increase or decrease as the percentage of actual effort increases or decreases  as described above 
when a new budget is approved  the remaining unrecognized amount of the upfront license fee will be recognized prospectively  using the methodology described above and applying any changes in the total estimated effort or period of development that is specified in the revised approved budget 
the amounts of the upfront license payment that we recognized as revenue for each fiscal quarter prior to the third quarter of were based upon several revised approved budgets  although the revisions to those budgets did not materially affect the amounts of revenue recognized in those periods 
during the third quarter of  the estimate of our total remaining effort to complete our development obligations was increased significantly based upon a revised development budget approved by both us and wyeth 
as a result  the period over which our obligations will extend  and over which the upfront payment will be amortized  was extended from the end of to the end of consequently  the amount of revenue recognized from the upfront payment in the year ended december  declined relative to that in the comparable period of due to the significant judgments involved in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement  further changes in any of those judgments are reasonably likely to occur in the future which could have a material impact on our revenue recognition 
if a collaborator terminates an agreement in accordance with the terms of the agreement  we would recognize any unamortized remainder of an upfront payment at the time of the termination 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis  then the total upfront license payments would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 

table of contents if we are involved in a steering or other committee as part of a multiple element arrangement  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
for those committees that are deemed obligations  we will evaluate our participation along with other obligations in the arrangement and will attribute revenue to our participation through the period of our committee responsibilities 
in relation to the wyeth collaboration  we have assessed the nature of our involvement with the jsc  jdc and jcc 
our involvement in the first two such committees is one of several obligations to develop the subcutaneous and intravenous formulations of relistor through regulatory approval in the us we have combined the committee obligations with the other development obligations and are accounting for these obligations during the development phase as a single unit of accounting 
after the development period  however  we have assessed the nature of our involvement with the committees to be a right  rather than an obligation 
our assessment is based upon the fact we negotiated to be on these committees as an accommodation for our granting of the license for relistor to wyeth 
further  wyeth has been granted by us an exclusive license even as to us to the technology and know how regarding relistor and has been assigned the agreements for the manufacture of relistor by third parties 
following regulatory approval of the subcutaneous and intravenous formulations of relistor  wyeth is required to continue to develop the oral formulation and to commercialize all formulations as provided in the wyeth collaboration  for which it is capable and responsible 
during those periods  the activities of these committees will be focused on wyeth s development and commercialization obligations 
as discussed in overview supportive care  wyeth returned the rights to relistor with respect to japan to us in connection with its election not to develop relistor there and the transaction with ono 
as a result  wyeth is now responsible for the development of the oral formulation worldwide excluding japan and the intravenous and subcutaneous formulations outside the us  other than japan 
collaborations may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance payments that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met i the milestone payment is non refundable  ii achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  iii substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  iv the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and v a reasonable amount of time passes between the upfront license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment substantive milestone method 
during october  may  april and july  we earned million  million  million and million  respectively  upon achievement of non refundable milestones anticipated in the wyeth collaboration  the first in connection with the commencement of a phase clinical trial of the intravenous formulation of relistor  the second in connection with the submission and acceptance for review of an nda for a subcutaneous formulation of relistor with the fda and a comparable submission in the european union  the third for the fda approval of subcutaneous relistor and the fourth for the european approval of subcutaneous relistor 
we considered those milestones to be substantive based on the significant degree of risk at the inception of the collaboration related to the conduct and successful completion of clinical trials and  therefore  of not achieving the milestones  the amount of the payment received relative to the significant costs incurred since inception of the wyeth collaboration and amount of effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of these milestones  and the passage of ten   and months  respectively  from inception of the collaboration to the achievement of those milestones 
therefore  we recognized the milestone payments as revenue in the respective periods in which the milestones were earned 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone and  therefore  the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the proportionate performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with the policies described above 
we will recognize revenue for payments that are contingent upon performance solely by our collaborator immediately upon the achievement of the defined event if we have no related performance obligations 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf are met  the amounts are determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recognized based upon net sales of related licensed products  as reported to us by wyeth 
royalty revenue is recognized in the period the sales occur  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement providing for the royalty 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  they would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and  therefore  recognized as such obligations are performed under either the proportionate performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with the policies described above 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date are classified as long term deferred revenue 
the estimate of the classification of deferred revenue as short term or long term is based upon management s current operating budget for the wyeth collaboration for our total effort required to complete our performance obligations under that arrangement 
that estimate may change in the future and such changes to estimates would be accounted for prospectively and would result in a change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 

table of contents in october  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ono under which we licensed to ono the rights to subcutaneous relistor in japan and under that agreement  in november  we received from ono an upfront payment of million 
as of december   relative to the million upfront payment from ono  we have recorded million as deferred revenue current  which we expect to recognize as revenue during the first quarter of  upon satisfaction of our performance obligations 
ono is responsible for developing and commercializing subcutaneous relistor in japan  including conducting the clinical development necessary to support regulatory marketing approval 
ono is to own the subcutaneous filings and approvals relating to relistor in japan 
we are also entitled to receive up to an additional million  payable upon achievement of development milestones 
ono is also obligated to pay to us royalties and commercialization milestones on sales by ono of subcutaneous relistor in japan 
ono has the option to acquire from us the rights to develop and commercialize in japan other formulations of relistor  including intravenous and oral forms  on terms to be negotiated separately 
supervision of and consultation with respect to ono s development and commercialization responsibilities will be carried out by joint committees consisting of members from both ono and us 
ono may request us to perform activities related to its development and commercialization responsibilities beyond our participation in these committees and specified technology transfer related tasks which will be at its expense  and payable to us for the services it requests  at the time we perform services for them 
nih grant and contract revenue is recognized as efforts are expended and as related subsidized project costs are incurred 
we perform work under the nih grants and contract on a best effort basis 
the nih reimburses us for costs associated with projects in the fields of virology and cancer  including pre clinical research  development and early clinical testing of a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent hiv from becoming established in uninfected individuals exposed to the virus  as requested by the nih 
substantive at risk milestone payments are uncommon in these arrangements  but would be recognized as revenue on the same basis as the substantive milestone method 
share based payment arrangements 
our share based compensation to employees includes non qualified stock options  restricted stock and shares issued under our purchase plans  which are compensatory under statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised fas r share based payment 
we account for share based compensation to non employees  including non qualified stock options and restricted stock  in accordance with eitf issue no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in connection with selling  goods or services 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective application  under which compensation cost for all share based awards that were unvested as of january   the adoption date  and those newly granted or modified after the adoption date will be recognized in our financial statements over the related requisite service periods  usually the vesting periods for awards with a service condition 
compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value of awards that are expected to vest 
as of december   there was million  million and million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options under the plans  the non vested shares and the purchase plans  respectively 
those costs are expected to be recognized over weighted average periods of years  years and years  respectively 
we apply a forfeiture rate to the number of unvested awards in each reporting period in order to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest 
estimated forfeiture rates are based upon historical data on vesting behavior of employees 
we adjust the total amount of compensation cost recognized for each award  in the period in which each award vests  to reflect the actual forfeitures related to that award 
changes in our estimated forfeiture rate will result in changes in the rate at which compensation cost for an award is recognized over its vesting period 
we have made an accounting policy decision to use the straight line method of attribution of compensation expense  under which the grant date fair value of share based awards will be recognized on a straight line basis over the total requisite service period for the total award 
under fas r  the fair value of each non qualified stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires input assumptions of stock price on the date of grant  exercise price  volatility  expected term  dividend rate and risk free interest rate 
for this purpose we use the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  as quoted on the nasdaq stock market llc  as the exercise price 
historical volatilities are based upon daily quoted market prices of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market llc over a period equal to the expected term of the related equity instruments 
we rely only on historical volatility since it provides the most reliable indication of future volatility 
future volatility is expected to be consistent with historical  historical volatility is calculated using a simple average calculation  historical data is available for the length of the option s expected term and a sufficient number of price observations are used consistently 
since our stock options are not traded on a public market  we do not use implied volatility 
for the years ended december   and  the volatility of our common stock has been high   and  respectively  which is common for entities in the biotechnology industry that do not have commercial products 
a higher volatility input to the black scholes model increases the resulting compensation expense 

table of contents the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
for the years ended december  and  our expected term was calculated based upon historical data related to exercise and post termination cancellation activity 
accordingly  for grants made to employees and officers excluding our chief executive officer and directors  we are using expected terms of and years and and years  respectively 
beginning in the third quarter of  we estimated the expected term of stock options granted to our chief executive officer to be years 
expected term for options granted to non employee consultants was ten years  which is the contractual term of those options 
for the july  award  the compensation committee of the board of directors modified the form of the grant used for stock incentive awards to provide for vesting of stock incentive awards granted on that date ratably over a three year period and for acceleration of the vesting of such awards and all previously granted and outstanding awards for any employee in the event that  following a change in control  such employee s employment is terminated without cause as such terms are defined in our stock incentive plan 
for the year ended december   our expected term was calculated based upon the simplified method as detailed in sab no 
accordingly  we used an expected term of years based upon the vesting period of the outstanding options of four or five years and a contractual term of ten years 
a shorter expected term would result in a lower compensation expense 
since we have never paid dividends and do not expect to pay dividends in the future  our dividend rate is zero 
the risk free rate for periods within the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
a portion of the options granted to our chief executive officer on july    and  on july  and on july  cliff vests after nine years and eleven months from the respective grant date 
the july   and awards have fully vested 
vesting of a defined portion of each award will occur earlier if a defined performance condition is achieved  more than one condition may be achieved in any period 
in accordance with fas r  at the end of each reporting period  we will estimate the probability of achievement of each performance condition and will use those probabilities to determine the requisite service period of each award 
the requisite service period for the award is the shortest of the explicit or implied service periods 
in the case of the executive s options  the explicit service period is nine years and eleven months from the respective grant dates 
the implied service periods related to the performance conditions are the estimated times for each performance condition to be achieved 
thus  compensation expense will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of performance conditions for that award assuming that the performance conditions will be achieved before the cliff vesting occurs 
on july   we granted options and restricted stock to our chief executive officer which vest on the basis of the achievement of specified performance or market based milestones 
the options have an exercise price equal to the closing price on our common stock on the date of grant while the restricted stock awards do not include an exercise price 
the awards to our chief executive officer are valued using a monte carlo simulation and the expense related to these grants will be recognized over the shortest estimated time for the achievement of the performance or market conditions 
the awards will not vest unless one of the milestones is achieved or the market condition is met 
changes in the estimate of probability of achievement of any performance or market condition will be reflected in compensation expense of the period of change and future periods affected by the change 
the fair value of shares purchased under the purchase plans is estimated on the date of grant in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option 
the same option valuation model is used for the purchase plans as for non qualified stock options  except that the expected term for the purchase plans is six months and the historical volatility is calculated over the six month expected term 
in applying the treasury stock method for the calculation of diluted earnings per share eps  amounts of unrecognized compensation expense and windfall tax benefits are required to be included in the assumed proceeds in the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation unless they are anti dilutive 
we incurred net losses for the years ended december   and  and  therefore  such amounts have not been included for those periods in the calculation of diluted eps since they would be anti dilutive 
accordingly  basic and diluted eps are the same for those periods 
we have made an accounting policy decision to calculate windfall tax benefits shortfalls for purposes of diluted eps calculations  excluding the impact of pro forma deferred tax assets 
this policy decision will apply when we have net income 
for the years ended december   and  no tax benefit was recognized related to total compensation cost for share based payment arrangements recognized in operations because we had a net loss for the period and the related deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
accordingly  no amounts related to windfall tax benefits have been reported in cash flows from operations or cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december   and 
table of contents research and development expenses including clinical trial expenses 
clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical investigators and clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
such costs are expensed as incurred  and are based on the expected total number of patients in the trial  the rate at which the patients enter the trial and the period over which the clinical investigators and clinical research organizations are expected to provide services 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
the collaboration agreement with wyeth in which wyeth has assumed all of the financial responsibility for further development  mitigates those costs 
in addition to clinical trial expenses  we estimate the amounts of other research and development expenses  for which invoices have not been received at the end of a period  based upon communication with third parties that have provided services or goods during the period 
on january   we adopted eitf issue eitf accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
prior to january   under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs  non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities for materials  equipment  facilities and purchased intangible assets that had no alternative future use were expensed as incurred 
beginning january   we have been capitalizing such non refundable advance payments and expensing them as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed

the change in the fair value of these investments is recorded as a component of other comprehensive loss 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas the fair value option of financial assets and financial liabilities effective january   which provides companies with an option to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the objective of fas is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
we have elected not to apply the fair value option to any of our financial assets or liabilities 
we also adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas fair value measurements effective january  for financial assets and financial liabilities 
fas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable 
in accordance with fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 we will defer the adoption of fas for our nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until january  we are currently evaluating the impact of fas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  and currently do not expect the adoption of this deferral to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the partial adoption of fas did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements 
fas established a three level hierarchy for fair value measurements that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the hierarchy level assigned to each security in our available for sale portfolio is based on our assessment of the transparency and reliability of the inputs used in the valuation of such instrument at the measurement date 
the three hierarchy levels are defined as follows level valuations based on unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical securities 
level valuations based on observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date  quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement  and involve management judgment

fsp fas provides guidance on how an entity s own assumptions about cash flows and discount rates should be considered when measuring fair value when relevant market data do not exist  how observable market information in an inactive or dislocated market affects fair value measurements and how the use of broker and pricing service quotes should be considered when applying fair value measurements 
fsp fas is effective immediately as of september  and for all interim and annual periods thereafter 
the adoption of fsp fas did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf issue no 
fsp eitf determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities

 earnings per share 
fsp eitf is effective january  and requires retrospective application 
we are currently evaluating the impact this fsp will have on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing our risk 
our investments consist of taxable corporate debt securities  securities of government sponsored entities and auction rate securities 
our investments totaled million at december  approximately million of these investments had fixed interest rates  and million had interest rates that were variable 
our marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
due to the conservative nature of our short term fixed interest rate investments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
our fixed interest rate long term investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the fair values of these investments due to differences between the market interest rate and the rate at the date of purchase of the investment 
a basis point increase in the december  market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in the market values of these investments 
as a result of recent changes in general market conditions  we determined to reduce the principal amount of auction rate securities in our portfolio as they came up for auction and invest the proceeds in other securities in accordance with our investment guidelines 
beginning in february  auctions failed for certain of our auction rate securities because sell orders exceeded buy orders 
as a result  at december   we continue to hold approximately million of assets measured at fair value of auction rate securities  in respect of which we have received all scheduled interest payments  which  in the event of auction failure  are reset according to the contractual terms in the governing instruments 
the principal amount of these remaining auction rate securities will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer calls or restructures the underlying security  the underlying security matures and is paid or a buyer outside the auction process emerges 
we continue to monitor the market for auction rate securities and consider its impact  if any  on the fair market value of our investments 
if the auction rate securities market conditions do not recover  we may be required to record additional losses in  which may affect our financial condition  cash flows and net loss 
we believe that the failed auctions experienced to date are not a result of the deterioration of the underlying credit quality of these securities  although valuation of them is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  such as changes to credit ratings of the securities and or the underlying assets supporting them  default rates applicable to the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk  ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity and general economic and market conditions 
we do not believe the carrying values of these auction rate securities are other than temporarily impaired and therefore expect the positions will eventually be liquidated without significant loss 

table of contents the valuation of the auction rate securities we hold is based on an internal analysis of timing of expected future successful auctions  collateralization of underlying assets of the security and credit quality of the security 
as a result of the estimated fair value  we have determined a temporary impairment in the valuation of these securities of million for the year ended december  a basis point increase to our internal analysis would result in an increase of approximately million in the temporary impairment of these securities as of the year ended december
