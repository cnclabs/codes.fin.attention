amounts in thousands  except per share data in addition to historical information  this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
we encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties  discussed in the section entitled item a risk factors  and the note regarding forward looking statements  included at the beginning of this form k 
the risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecasted in forward looking statements or implied in historical results and trends 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery  development and delivery of biologic therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with severe and life threatening disease states  including hematologic and neurologic diseases  transplant rejection  cancer and autoimmune disorders 
our marketed product soliris eculizumab is the first therapy approved for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  or pnh 
soliris is designed to inhibit a specific aspect of the complement component of the immune system and thereby treat inflammation associated with chronic hematologic and neurological disorders  transplant rejection  and autoimmune disorders 
soliris is a humanized antibody that generally blocks complement activity for one to two weeks after a single dose at the doses currently prescribed 
the initial indication for which we received approval for soliris is pnh 
pnh is a rare  debilitating and life threatening  acquired genetic deficiency blood disorder defined by the destruction of red blood cells  or hemolysis 
the chronic hemolysis in patients with pnh may be associated with life threatening thromboses  recurrent pain  kidney disease  disabling fatigue  impaired quality of life  severe anemia  pulmonary hypertension  shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark colored urine hemoglobinuria 
since our incorporation in january until april  we devoted most of our resources to drug discovery  research  and product and clinical development 
in march  the food and drug administration  or fda  granted marketing approval for soliris 
in the united states  soliris is indicated for the treatment of all patients with pnh to reduce hemolysis 
we began commercial sale of soliris in the united states during april in june  the european commission  or ec  approved the use of soliris for patients with pnh in the european union  which also serves as the basis for approval in iceland and norway 
subsequently  we engaged with appropriate authorities on the operational  reimbursement  price approval and funding processes that are separately required in each country and have initiated commercialization in those countries where this process was completed 
in june  the european commission  or ec  approved the use of soliris for patients with pnh in the european union  which also serves as the basis for approval in iceland and norway 
subsequently  we engaged with appropriate authorities on the operational  reimbursement  price approval and funding processes that are 
table of contents separately required in each country and have initiated commercialization in those countries where this process is completed 
in several countries outside the united states  we continued meaningful sales to individual patients through approved named patient programs during we have submitted an application for marketing authorization in australia for soliris for the treatment of patients with pnh 
the application was accepted for priority review 
soliris has received orphan drug designation in australia  which provides certain regulatory and filing fee advantages  including market exclusivity for several years after approval subject to certain exceptions 
we have also submitted applications for marketing authorization for soliris in canada and switzerland for the treatment of patients with pnh 
we were granted limited marketing authorization in switzerland in september and approval in canada in january we completed the week aegis study of japanese patients in october this study was a single registration study to evaluate the safety  efficacy  and pharmacology of soliris as a treatment for japanese patients with pnh 
the open label study was authorized by japan s pharmaceutical and medical devices agency 
summary results were reported in december the pre specified primary efficacy endpoint of change in hemolysis was achieved with statistical significance and the drug appeared to be safe and well tolerated in study patients 
we are also focusing our research efforts on the use of eculizumab as a treatment for patients with other rare and severe complement mediated conditions  including chronic hemolytic and thrombotic disorders  transplant rejection and chronic and debilitating neurological disorders 
the fda authorized our investigational new drug application  or ind  for studying the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in treating myasthenia gravis  a rare autoimmune syndrome characterized by the failure of neuromuscular transmission  and we commenced clinical development in we are currently developing clinical programs to investigate the use of eculizumab as a treatment for patients with other complement mediated disorders  including three severe  life threatening  and rare hematologic disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome  or ahus  a disease in which the lack of naturally occurring complement inhibitors can cause life threatening kidney damage  catastrophic anti phospholipid syndrome  a disorder in which uncontrollable blood clotting often leads to multiple organ failure  and cold agglutinin disease  an auto immune hemolytic anemia 
the program for ahus was initiated in january  also  we completed a phase i ii proof of concept study of iv eculizumab in allergic asthmatic patients in the fourth quarter of we are aware that investigator initiated trials of eculizumab have begun in patients with multifocal motor neuropathy mmn  a severe autoimmune neurologic disorder  and dense deposit disease  a severe kidney disease 
we are also aware that independent investigators have commenced a study to evaluate eculizumab in organ transplantation 
the fda has also authorized our ind to evaluate the activity of an antibody to the immune regulator cd in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll  an incurable chronic cancer that results from expansion of b lymphocytes  and other blood tumors such as multiple myeloma 
we commenced dosing of initial cll patients with anti cd in the second quarter of in july  the company s board of directors approved a two for one stock split to be effected in the form of a percent stock dividend 
the additional shares were distributed on august  to stockholders of record as of the close of trading on august  all share and per share data presented in this form k have been retroactively restated to reflect this stock split 

table of contents in october  certain holders of our convertible senior notes due  or notes  exercised conversion rights with respect to an aggregate principal amount of  of the notes resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock 
the shares were issued in november on december   the outstanding principal balance of the notes was  critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the significant accounting policies and basis of preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  business overview and summary of significant accounting policies 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the judgments  estimates and assumptions associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies revenue recognition royalties inventories research and development expenses stock based compensation long lived assets income taxes revenue recognition net product sales our principal source of revenue is product sales 
we have applied the following principles in recognizing revenue to date  our product sales have consisted solely of soliris 
we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
amounts collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities  which are primarily comprised of value added taxes vat in foreign jurisdictions  are presented on a net basis in the company s statements of operations  and do not impact net product sales 
in the united states  our customers are primarily specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies who supply physician office clinics  hospital outpatient clinics  infusion clinics or home health care providers 
in some cases  we also sell soliris to government agencies 
outside the united states  our customers are primarily hospitals  hospital buying groups  pharmacies  other health care providers and distributors 

table of contents in addition to commercial sales  we have recorded revenue on sales for individual patients through named patient programs outside the united states 
the relevant authorities or institutions in those countries have agreed to reimburse for product sold on a named patient basis where soliris has not received final approval for commercial sales 
we record estimated rebates payable under governmental programs  including medicaid and programs in europe  as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
our calculations related to these rebate accruals require estimates  including estimates of customer mix  to determine which sales will be subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
we update our estimates and assumptions each period and record any necessary adjustments to our reserves 
generally  the length of time between product sale and the processing and reporting of the rebates is three to nine months 
upon reconciliation of government reporting to our sales records  we revise our estimates of rebates payable  which may have an impact on revenue in the period in which the adjustment was made 
due to the limited number of rebate programs  the small number of patients treated with soliris  the short period of time from sale of product to patient infusion and the lack of contractual rights of return  we are able to estimate rebates payable to third parties such that future adjustments are expected to be insignificant 
we have provided balances and activity in the rebates payable account for the year ended december   and as follows rebates payable balance at december  allowances for sales payments credits made for sales balance at december  allowances for sales payments credits made for sales balance at december  because of the pricing of soliris  the limited number of patients  the short period from sale of product to patient infusion and lack of contractual return rights  soliris customers generally carry limited inventory 
we monitor inventory within our distribution channel to determine whether deferral of sales are required related to inventory in our sales channels 
to date  actual refunds and returns have been negligible 
we also record distribution and other fees paid to our customers as a reduction of revenue 
these costs are known at the time of sale  resulting in minimal adjustments subsequent to the period of sale 
deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts 
royalties our cost of sales includes royalties to third parties related to the sale and commercial manufacture of soliris 
we estimate our royalty obligations based on existing contractual obligations and our assessment of estimated 
table of contents royalties owed to other third parties 
these estimates may be influenced by the outcome of unasserted claims and litigation  the results of which are uncertain see note of our consolidated financial statements 
on a periodic basis and based on events such as the outcome of litigation  we may reassess these estimates  resulting in adjustments to cost of sales 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value 
we determine the cost of inventory using the average cost method 
for products that are in initial clinical development  we capitalize inventory costs prior to regulatory approval  but subsequent to the filing of the biologics license application  or bla  when we determine that the inventory has probable future economic benefit 
inventory is not capitalized prior to completion of a phase iii clinical trial 
we also capitalize the cost of inventory manufactured at our manufacturing plant in property  plant and equipment prior to validation of the facility by the fda 
once we receive approval by the fda  the cost of the inventory will be reclassified from property  plant and equipment to inventory 
we analyze our inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to sale  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value  or inventory in excess of expected sales requirements 
although the manufacturing of our product is subject to strict quality control  certain batches or units of product may  after a period of time  no longer meet quality specifications or may expire  at which point we would adjust our inventory values 
soliris currently has a maximum estimated life of months and  based on our sales forecasts  we expect to fully realize the carrying value of the soliris inventory 
the determination of whether or not inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by our management 
a critical input in this determination is future expected inventory requirements  based on internal sales forecasts 
we then compare these requirements to the expiry dates of inventory on hand 
to the extent that inventory is expected to expire prior to being sold  we will write down the value of inventory 
if actual results differ from those estimates  additional inventory write offs may be required 
to date  we have not recorded any material adjustments to our inventory related to excess  expired or obsolete inventory 
in the future  reduced demand  quality issues or excess supply may result in write downs  which would be recorded as adjustments to cost of sales 
research and development expenses we accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by the contract research organizations cro s  clinical study sites  laboratories  consultants  or other clinical trial vendors that perform the activities 
related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
activity levels are monitored through close communication with the cro s and other clinical trial vendors  including detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts  analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment schedules  and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed 
certain cro and significant clinical trial vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial 
the estimates are reviewed and discussed with the cro or vendor as 
table of contents necessary  and are included in research and development expenses for the related period 
for clinical study sites  which are paid periodically on a per subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study  we accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrolment in each quarter 
the estimates may differ from the actual amount subsequently invoiced  which may result in adjustment to research and development expense several months after the related services were performed 
stock based compensation we have one stock based compensation plan known as the incentive plan 
under this plan  restricted stock  stock options and other stock related awards may be granted to our directors  officers  employees and consultants or advisors of the company or any subsidiary 
our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility 
we also estimate expected term until exercise  forfeiture or cancellation  as well as the reduction in the expense from expected forfeitures 
we currently use historical exercise and cancellation patterns as our best estimate of future estimated life 
actual volatility and lives of options may be significantly different from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of fas r  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from our prior recorded amounts 
long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include  among others  the following a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in market value of assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  such amount is recognized as an impairment charge 
other than the integration plan initiated with our subsidiary  alexion antibody technologies  inc  we have not experienced a significant triggering event and  therefore  have not recorded any impairment charges related to our long lived assets 
to the extent we were to experience a triggering event  particularly as it relates to our largest long lived asset  the smithfield  rhode island manufacturing facility  the resulting analysis may require an impairment charge to our statement of operations 

table of contents income taxes despite achieving profitability in  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance on our net operating losses nols and other deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions because we have an extended history of annual losses in these jurisdictions 
federal nol carryforwards total approximately  during  we reversed valuation allowances related to several foreign entities  based on an assessment of current and future profitability 
on a quarterly basis  we reassess the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets 
we would consider reversing a significant portion of the valuation reserve upon assessment of certain factors  including i a demonstration of sustained profitability  and ii the support of internal financial forecasts demonstrating the utilization of the nols prior to their expiration 
if we determine that the reversal of the valuation reserves in these jurisdictions is appropriate  a significant one time benefit will be recognized against our income tax provision in the period of the reversal 
in addition  the portion of our nols and income tax credits related to deductions for employee stock options will be credited to additional paid in capital if and when realized 
at such time  we will also commence recognizing an income tax provision at our effective tax rate 
however  our ability to utilize our nols and credits to offset taxable income will continue to provide us with cash savings until the nols and credits are fully utilized or expire 
the nols and credits remain subject to examination by federal and state authorities due to their carried forward position 
we adopted the provisions of fin and fsp fin  definition of settlement in fasb interpretation no 
 or fsp fin  effective january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists  advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own experience 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
adjustments may be made to these estimates as a result of events such as resolution of tax audits or lapsing of statutory audit periods 
we will also refine these estimates over time as our operations mature and as we gain more experience operating as a taxpayer on a worldwide basis 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our tax provision  and related effective tax rate  recorded in our statement of operations could be materially impacted

table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues during the year ended december   we recorded sales of soliris related to commercial sales in the united states of  and commercial and named patient sales outside the united states of  included in revenue from outside the united states  we have recorded a gain of  related to our foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
during the year ended december   we recorded sales of soliris related to commercial sales in the united states of  and commercial and named patient sales in the european union of in march  the fda granted approval for soliris for the treatment of pnh 
in june  the ec also approved soliris for the treatment of pnh 
our product sales have been solely attributable to sales of soliris and have been generated from three sources commercial sales in the united states beginning in the second quarter of  named patient sales prior to full scale commercialization in certain countries outside the united states beginning in the first quarter of and commercial sales in countries outside the united states beginning in the fourth quarter of 
the increases in revenue for fiscal year versus were due to an increased number of patients treated with soliris as a result of our product launch in the united states and in various countries in europe 
as additional physicians request soliris for their patients with pnh and obtain governmental reimbursement  we expect that the number of patients receiving soliris treatments will increase  resulting in an increase in product sales in existing countries 
we also expect product sales in the rest of the world to increase as we progress with appropriate authorities on the regulatory  price approval and reimbursement process in additional territories

cost of sales includes actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of soliris  as well as other manufacturing costs 
changes in the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods 
product sold during the year ended december  included inventory that was previously expensed prior to submission of our bla and therefore is not included in the cost of sales during this period 
during the fourth quarter of  we exhausted the supply of previously expensed inventory 
beginning in  our cost of sales reflected the full manufacturing cost of the inventory 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a patent license agreement and settlement agreement with pdl biopharma in which we are obligated to pay a total of  for a fully paid  perpetual license 
as a result of the settlement and evaluation of other potential royalties  we recorded a reduction in cost of goods sold of approximately  related to an adjustment of estimated accrued royalties for sales of soliris prior to the fourth quarter 
we further expect that this settlement will have a favorable impact of our future cost of goods sold 

table of contents on a periodic basis and based on events such as the outcome of litigation  we may reassess the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods 
research and development expenses our research and development expense includes personnel  facility and external costs associated with the research and development of our product candidates  as well as product development costs 
we group our research and development expenses into two major categories external direct expenses and all other r d expenses 
external direct expenses are comprised of costs paid to outside parties for clinical development  product development and discovery research 
clinical costs are comprised of costs to conduct and manage clinical trials related to soliris and other product candidates 
product development costs  which historically relate primarily to soliris  are those incurred in performing duties related to pre and post approval manufacturing development and regulatory functions 
discovery research costs are incurred in conducting laboratory studies and performing preclinical research for other uses of soliris and other product candidates 
clinical costs have been accumulated and allocated to each of our programs  while product development and discovery research costs have not been allocated 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs relate to efforts on our clinical and preclinical products as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been allocated directly to each program 
the following table provides information regarding research and development expenses year ended december  year ended december  variance variance clinical development product development discovery research total external direct expenses payroll and benefits operating and occupancy depreciation and amortization total other r d expenses research and development expense 
table of contents the following table summarizes external direct expenses related to our clinical development programs 
please refer to item  business  for a description of each of these programs year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  accumulated expenditures since january  external direct expenses soliris pnh program soliris non pnh programs cd program pexelizumab other previous to january   we have spent approximately  on all research development programs 
substantially all of our research and development expenses prior to the year ended december  were related to two products  eculizumab and pexelizumab 
we obtained approval for eculizumab for the treatment of pnh in in the united states and european union  and ceased development of pexelizumab in the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
a large portion of our annual expenses relates to commercialization of soliris and general and administrative costs 
we may not have or be able to raise the necessary capital to support both the commercialization of soliris as well as each of our development programs through and until commercialization 
further  we cannot guarantee that results of clinical trials will be favorable or sufficient to support regulatory approvals for our other programs 
we could decide to abandon development or be required to spend considerable resources not otherwise contemplated 
for additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs  please refer to the risk factors in this form k  including the risk factors set forth on page if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to continue the commercialization of soliris or continue to complete our product development  page none of our product candidates except for soliris has received regulatory approvals  page completion of pre clinical studies or clinical trials does not guarantee advancement to the next phase of development and page there are many reasons why drug testing could be delayed or terminated 
during the year ended december   we incurred research and development expenses of  a decrease of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the following decrease of  in research and development payroll and benefit expense related primarily to a reduction in stock based compensation due to employee forfeitures and additional capitalization to inventory and property  plant and equipment 
increase of in depreciation and amortization related primarily to the amortization of costs associated with our new pilot plant located at our manufacturing facility in smithfield  ri  which was placed in service in the fourth quarter 
table of contents decrease of  in discovery research was primarily due to a reduction in external research and consulting fees 
decrease of  in product development expenses due to increased manufacturing and plant readiness activities including a decrease of approximately relating to additional capitalization of costs associated with the validation of our manufacturing facility in smithfield  rhode island 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase in due to clinical trials  manufacturing costs and research related to eculizumab and anti cd development programs 
for additional information on these programs  please refer to product and development programs in item i of this form k 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of  an increase of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following during the year ended december   salaries  benefits and other labor expenses increased to  an increase of  or  versus  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities  including increases in payroll and benefits costs of  related to our global commercial operations teams 
other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive  finance  information technology  human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity 
increase in non labor commercial operations of  for the year ended december  was primarily due to the expansion of our foreign operations  which we expanded significantly in the latter half of increase in non labor general and administration of  primarily related to increases in legal costs associated with ongoing litigation and increases in infrastructure costs to support our growth as a commercial entity 
decrease in non labor information technology of  primarily related to the costs associated with the build out of our european operations in we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in  reflecting the additional growth of our organizational structure in the us and the rest of the world 
other income expense during the year ended december   we recognized of foreign currency loss  a decrease of  or  versus a gain of  incurred during the year ended december  the decreased impact of foreign currency fluctuations was due to our hedging programs implemented in during the year ended december   investment income decreased  or to  due primarily to reduced interest rates earned in money market funds 
during the year ended december   interest expense of  was consistent with the amounts recognized during the year ended december  
table of contents income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of  compared to an income tax benefit of for the year ended december  the tax expense during is principally attributable to entities in certain foreign jurisdictions who achieved profitability during the year  offset by the reversal of valuation allowances in these foreign jurisdictions and the exchange of research tax credits for cash 
the income tax benefit for is attributable to the exchange of research tax credits for cash 
the company maintains a valuation allowance against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets as realizability of those assets is uncertain 
during  we will continue to monitor our deferred tax assets in order to assess whether adjustments related to our valuation allowance may be required 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues during the year ended december   we recorded sales of soliris related to commercial sales in the united states of  and commercial and named patient sales in the european union of  because our commercial and pre approval sales programs did not begin until  there were no sales of soliris for the year ended december  we recorded contract research revenues of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
contract research revenues reflect the amortization of deferred revenue resulting from cash received from p g under our collaboration for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab and us government funded research grant revenue for our asthma program 
for the year ended december   the increase in contract research revenue  as compared to the year ended december   was due to the termination of our collaborative agreement with p g 
effective march   we and p g agreed to terminate our collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of pexelizumab 
as the agreement has been terminated  the remaining portion of the  non refundable upfront license fee  or  was recognized as revenue during the three months ended march  due to the termination of the p g agreement  we expect that future contract research revenue will be dependent upon future awards or grants 
for the year ended december   the decrease in us government grants  as compared to the same period in the prior year  was primarily due to the conclusion of the anthrax program in cost of sales cost of sales was  for the year ended december  there was no cost of sales incurred for periods prior to december  cost of sales includes actual and estimated royalty expenses associated with sales of soliris  as well as other manufacturing costs 
changes in the estimates of royalties owed to certain third parties could have a material impact on our cost of sales in future periods 
product sold during the year ended december  included inventory that was previously expensed prior to submission of our bla  and therefore is not included in the cost of sales during this period 
during the fourth quarter of  we exhausted the supply of previously expensed inventory

increase of  in product development expenses due to an increase of  related to expenditures for drug development  quality assurance  scientific communications and regulatory affairs due to the regulatory approvals in both the united states march and the european union june 
the increase was offset by a decrease in manufacturing costs of  related to the capitalization of inventory costs beginning with filing of the bla in september prior to september  we expensed all manufacturing costs  resulting in lower expenses compared to decrease of  in discovery research was primarily due to the closure of aat operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of  an increase of  or versus the  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following during the year ended december   salaries  benefits and other labor expenses increased to  an increase of  or  versus  incurred during the year ended december  the increase was a result of increased headcount related to commercial development activities  including increases in payroll and benefits costs of  related to our global commercial operations teams 
other increases related to payroll and benefits within our executive  finance  information technology  human resources and legal groups to support our growth as a commercial entity 

table of contents increase in non labor commercial operations of  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   this increase was comprised primarily of increases in advertising and promotion of soliris related to the april commercial launch in the united states and market research related to approval of soliris in the european union  as well as promotion of soliris for commercial launches in certain european countries 
increase in non labor general and administration and information technology of  for the year ended december  related to increases in infrastructure costs to support our growth as a commercial entity 
other income expense during the year ended december   we recognized  of foreign currency gain 
there was no foreign currency gain loss recorded in as a result of our european operations  we have exposure  primarily from accounts receivable and intercompany receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily related to the euro 
during the year ended december   investment income and interest expense were consistent with the results recognized during the year ended december  income taxes during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the tax benefit was attributable to an increase in the estimated cash exchange of a state incremental research and development tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands  except per share data as of december   our consolidated cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities totaled  the  increase from december  is largely attributable to the significantly increased sales and the resulting collection of accounts receivable and proceeds from employee option exercises  offset by payments for our patent purchase from omrf and investments in inventory and our smithfield  rhode island facility 
until required for use in the business  we invest our cash reserves in money market funds and high quality commercial  corporate and us government notes in accordance with our investment policy 
we do not have any investments in auction rate securities 
as of december   of cash was restricted to be used for the construction and other costs related to our rhode island manufacturing facility 
an additional  is restricted as part of a leasehold deposit for office space 
financial instruments that potentially expose the company to concentrations of credit risk are limited to cash equivalents  accounts receivable and our foreign exchange derivative contracts 
substantially all cash equivalents are held in a single aaa rated institutional money market fund that participates in the us department of treasury s temporary guarantee program for money market funds 
at december   two individual customers accounted for and of the accounts receivable balance 
for the period ended december   one customer accounted for of our product sales 

table of contents at december   we have foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling  these outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a fair value of  which is included in other current assets 
the counterparty to these forward contracts is a large multinational commercial bank  and we believe the risk of nonperformance is not material 
however  we can not be assured that the financial institution will not be further impacted by the negative economic environment 
at december   our working capital was  compared to  at december  at december   our current ratio was  compared to at december  the decrease in current ratio relates primarily to the  license payable owed to pdl biopharma 
we anticipate that cash generated from operations and our existing available cash  as well as interest and investment income earned on available cash and marketable securities  should provide us adequate resources to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements as currently planned for at least the next twelve months 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december  versus  used in operating activities for the year ended december  the change is primarily due to the net income achieved in versus the net loss as compared to the same period in the components of cash provided by operating activities for the period ended december  are as follows our reported net income  plus non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  unrealized currency gain  unrealized hedge gains  unrealized pension losses and stock compensation  of  net cash outflow due to changes in operating assets of  primarily attributable to increases in inventories and accounts receivable  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  the growth in our sales of soliris has required substantial investments in working capital items such as inventories and accounts receivable 
in  we expect changes in cash from operations to be highly dependent on sales levels  and the related cash collections  from soliris 
in addition  we expect that cash outflows related to the changes in operating assets will continue to increase related to sales and resulting accounts receivable increases 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  versus  provided by investing activities for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the net cash used for investing activities consisted of the following cash inflow from the net sale of marketable securities of  which was used to fund our operations additions to property  plant and equipment of  of which  was attributable to the construction of our rhode island manufacturing facility  with the remaining attributable to spending on information technology and facility capital costs outflow of  for the purchase of patents from omrf and  for the purchase of a license in association with the acquisition of legend kk

commercial commitments our commercial commitments consist of research and development  license  operational  clinical development  and manufacturing cost commitments  along with anticipated supporting arrangements  subject to certain limitations and cancellation clauses 
the timing and level of our commercial scale manufacturing costs  which may or may not be realized  are contingent upon the progress of our clinical development programs and our commercialization plans 
our commercial commitments are represented principally by our supply agreement with lonza sales ag 
lonza agreement we have a supply agreement with lonza sales ag relating to the manufacture of soliris  which requires payments to lonza at the inception of the contract and as product is manufactured

these income tax credits expire between and due to the amount of our nols and credit carryforwards  we do not anticipate paying substantial us federal income taxes in the foreseeable future 
we do expect to pay cash taxes in a number of foreign jurisdictions  as well as certain states  where our net operating losses were fully utilized during we were subject to the alternative minimum tax during and expect that we will continue to be subject to cash payments for the alternative minimum tax in the near term 
the tax reform act of contains certain provisions that can limit a taxpayer s ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year resulting from cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of percent over a three year period 
we have determined that these limiting provisions were triggered during a prior year 
however  we believe that such limitation is not expected to result in the expiration or loss of any of our federal nols

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands  except per share data interest rate risk as of december   we held all of our cash equivalents and investments in money market funds with original maturity dates of three months or less 
our outstanding long term liabilities as of december  included our  convertible senior notes due february  as the notes bear interest at a fixed rate  our results of operations would not be impacted by interest rate changes 
in july  we borrowed  to finance the purchase and construction of our smithfield  rhode island manufacturing facility 
in july  we amended the mortgage loan agreement with istar financial inc to increase the loan amount by  resulting in an aggregate principal balance of  from the effective date of the amendment  the mortgage loan bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
accordingly  any changes in the interest rate will not impact our financial statements

we do not expect changes in interest rates related to our revolving credit facility to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in conjunction with the purchase of patents from omrf  we agreed to pay an aggregate principal amount of  representing the balance of the  purchase price for the omrf patent rights 
interest shall accrue on any unpaid amount at the rate of of the sum of the prime rate as published in the money rates section of the wall street journal new york edition plus  per annum 
we do not expect changes in interest rates related to this payable to have a material effect on our financial statements 
foreign exchange market risk as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro and british pound 
the current exposures arise primarily from cash  accounts receivable  intercompany receivables and payables and product sales denominated in foreign currencies 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that foreign currency exchange rates have on our international operating expenses 
in the first quarter of  we began a program to limit the foreign currency exposure of our monetary assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
in the third quarter of  we commenced a program to hedge a portion of our forecasted product sales to mitigate fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
both programs utilize forward foreign exchange contracts intended to reduce  not eliminate  the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling  as of december   our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts had a fair value of  which is included in other current assets liabilities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the counterparty to these forward contracts is a multinational commercial bank 
the company believes the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material 
since our foreign currency hedges are designed to offset gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities  we do not expect that a hypothetical adverse change fluctuation in exchange rates would result in a material change in the fair value of our foreign currency sensitive assets  which include our monetary assets and liabilities and our forward contracts 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on future transactions such as anticipated sales
