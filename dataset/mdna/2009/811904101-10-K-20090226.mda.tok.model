table of contents inland river services business inland river services owns  operates  invests in and markets inland river transportation equipment 
the company believes it operates one of the industry s newest fleets of dry cargo and liquid tank barges transporting agricultural  industrial  chemical and petrochemical products on the us inland river waterways  primarily the mississippi river  illinois river  tennessee river  ohio river and their tributaries and the gulf intracoastal waterways 
inland river services also owns towboats used for moving barges  fleeting operations used in barge loading and unloading activities  and deck barges for specialized projects 
it also manages barges for third parties 
inland river services contributed  and of consolidated operating revenues in  and  respectively 
equipment and services the following table sets forth the number of dry cargo barges  liquid tank barges  deck barges and towboats owned and or operated by inland river services 
owned joint ventured leased in pooled or managed total inland river dry cargo barges open inland river dry cargo barges covered inland river liquid tank barges inland river deck barges inland river towboats inland river dry cargo barges open inland river dry cargo barges covered inland river liquid tank barges inland river deck barges inland river towboats inland river dry cargo barges open inland river dry cargo barges covered inland river liquid tank barges inland river deck barges inland river towboats 
table of contents as of december   the average age in years of inland river services owned and joint ventured fleet was as follows dry cargo barges liquid tank barges  barrel liquid tank barges  barrel deck barges towboats towboats have been upgraded and maintained to meet or exceed current industry standards 
inland barges are unmanned and are moved on the us inland river waterways by towboats 
the combination of a towboat and dry cargo barges is commonly referred to as a tow 
the inland river services dry cargo fleet consists of open and covered hopper barges 
open hopper barges are used to transport commodities that are not sensitive to water such as coal  aggregate and scrap 
covered hopper barges are more versatile because they can also carry water sensitive products  such as grain  ores  alloys  cements and fertilizer 
each dry cargo barge in inland river services fleet is capable of transporting approximately  to  tons  to  metric tons of cargo 
the carrying capacity of a barge at any particular time is determined by water depth in the river channels and hull size of the barge 
adverse river conditions  such as high water resulting from excessive rainfall or low water caused by drought  can also impact operations by limiting the speed at which tows travel the us inland river waterways  the number of barges included in tows and the quantity of cargo that is loaded in the barges 
typical dry cargo voyage activity requires shifting a clean  empty barge from a fleeting location to a loading facility 
the barge is then moved from the loading location and assembled into a tow before proceeding to its next destination 
after unloading  it is shifted to a fleeting area for cleaning and repair  if needed  before being moved again into a load position 
typically  grain cargos move southbound and non grain cargos move northbound 
generally  inland river services attempts to coordinate the logistical match up of northbound and southbound movements of cargo to minimize repositioning costs 
as of december   of the dry cargo barges were chartered to  and operated by  other operators for various periods of time for a fixed rate per day 
the remaining dry cargo barges were operated by inland river services through a pooling arrangement that inland river services manages 
pursuant to this arrangement  operating revenues and voyage expenses are pooled and the net results are allocated to participants based upon the number of days the barges participate in the pool 
each barge owner is responsible for the costs of insurance  maintenance and repair as well as for capital and financing costs of its own equipment in the pool 
inland river services fleet of  barrel liquid tank barges transports liquid bulk commodities such as lube oils  solvents and glycols 
the operating arrangements for these barges are similar to those of the dry cargo barges described above 
inland river services fleet of  barrel liquid tank barges transports refined petroleum products and black oil products and are normally chartered out as unit tows consisting of two to three barges along with a towboat working in patterns prescribed by the customer 
inland river services is responsible for providing manpower for the towboats working in such operations 
inland river services owns a fleeting operation  which is a staging area for grouping barges in preparation for movements up and down the river and a holding area for barges waiting to load and unload cargo 
this fleeting operation is managed by a third party 
inland river services has a controlling interest in a tank farm and handling facility in sauget  illinois 
the facility is multi modal  supporting truck  rail  unit trains and barges  and commenced operations in may 
table of contents inland river services has a interest in a joint venture that owns a fleet of inland marine transportation assets with a view toward generating cash returns that may be enhanced by entering into strategic positions in marketable securities and commodity futures 
under the terms of the joint venture agreement and until october   inland river services has agreed to offer the joint venture the option to invest in any new dry cargo and liquid tank barges that inland river services acquires  subject to certain exceptions 
inland river services has a interest in a joint venture that operates a grain and fertilizer storage and handling facility in mcleansboro  illinois 
inland river services has a interest in a joint venture with a third party in south america to operate towboats and dry cargo barges on the parana paraguay rivers 
the joint venture was capitalized through equity contributions by the joint venture partners and bank debt 
during the year ended december   inland river services sold open and covered dry cargo barges to the joint venture 
during the year ended december   inland river services sold four towboats and open dry cargo barges to the joint venture 
markets the market for inland river services is driven by supply and demand economics  which impacts prices  margins achieved and utilization of inland river services assets 
the relationship between supply and demand reflects many factors  including the level of domestic and international production of the basic agricultural products to be transported in particular the yields from grain harvests the level of domestic and international consumption of agricultural products and the effect of these levels on the volumes of products that are physically moved into the export markets domestic and worldwide demand for iron ore  steel  steel by products  coal  ethanol  petroleum and other bulk commodities strength or weakness of the us dollar the cost of ocean freight and the cost of fuel within the united states  other local factors also have an effect on pricing and margins  including the supply of barges available to move the products the cost of qualified wheelhouse personnel the ability to position the barges to maximize efficiencies and utility in moving cargos both northbound and southbound the cost of alternative forms of transportation primarily rail general operating logistics on the river network including size and operating status of locks and dams the effect of river levels on the loading capacities of the barges in terms of draft restrictions seasonality during harsh winters the upper mississippi river usually closes to barge traffic from mid december to mid march 
ice often hinders the navigation of barge traffic on the mid mississippi river  the illinois river and the upper ohio river during the same period 
the volume of grain transported from the midwest to the us gulf of mexico  which is primarily for export  is greatest during the harvest season from mid august through late november 
the harvest season is particularly significant because pricing tends to peak during these months in response to higher demand for equipment 

table of contents customers and contractual arrangements the principal customers for inland river services are major agricultural companies  major integrated oil companies and industrial companies 
in  there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
the ten largest customers of inland river services accounted for approximately of inland river services revenues in the loss of one or a few of its customers would likely not have a material adverse effect on inland river services results of operations 
most of inland river services dry cargo barges are employed under contracts of affreightment that can vary in duration  ranging from one voyage to several years 
for longer term contracts  base rates may be adjusted in response to changes in fuel prices and operating expenses 
some longer term contracts provide for the transport of a minimum number of tons of cargo or specific transportation requirements for a particular customer 
some barges are bareboat chartered out to third parties for a fixed rate per day for the duration of the charter 
these contracts tend to be longer  ranging in term from one to five years 
inland river services generally charges a price per ton for point to point transportation of dry bulk commodities 
customers are permitted a specified number of days to load and discharge the cargo and thereafter pay a per diem demurrage rate for extra time 
from time to time  dry cargo barges may be used for storage for a period prior to delivery 
inland river services contracts with third parties to provide towing services to move its dry cargo barges on a spot basis 
towing prices are market driven with prices typically higher during periods of peak movement 
in addition  towing prices are directly impacted by changes in the cost of fuel and wages for vessel personnel 
inland river services  barrel liquid tank barges are either chartered out on term contracts ranging from one to five years or marketed on the spot market 
inland river services  barrel liquid tank barges are marketed primarily as unit tows under term contracts ranging from one to five years 
competitive conditions generally  inland river services believes the primary barriers to effective competitive entry into the us inland river waterways market are the complexity of operations  the consolidation of the inland river towing industry and the difficulty in assembling a large enough fleet and an experienced staff to execute voyages efficiently and re position barges effectively to optimize their use 
the primary competitive factors among established operators are price  availability and reliability of barges and equipment of a suitable type and condition for a specific cargo 
the company believes there are four major domestic companies that operate over  dry cargo barges each  with one of those operating over  barges 
there are also five mid sized barge companies that operate more than but less than  barges 
while inland river services main competitors are other barge lines  railroads also compete for traffic that might otherwise move on the us inland river waterways 
the company believes there are five other domestic companies that operate over liquid tank barges each 
these companies control approximately of the equipment in the liquid cargo market

commodity trading business commodity trading operates an integrated business involved in the purchase  storage  transportation and sale of agricultural and energy commodities 
the principal commodities currently involved are rice  ethanol  clean blendstocks and sugar 
commodity trading contributed and of consolidated operating revenues in and  respectively 

table of contents products and services commodity trading is divided into two main groups each with a specific focus 
agricultural 
the agricultural group is primarily focused on the global origination  trading and merchandising of rough and milled rice and sugar 
this group sources product from various export countries and arranges for the bundling and transport of the product to various import countries for sale in bulk or through local distribution networks 
the group s involvement in sugar is through an investment in a joint venture that focuses primarily on south america and the caribbean 
energy 
the energy group is primarily focused on the domestic trading and transportation of physical ethanol and clean blendstocks 
commodity trading uses a variety of transportation modes to transport its products  including trucks  railcars  river barges and ocean going vessels  which are generally leased 
the transportation services are typically provided by truck lines  railroads and barge and ocean freight companies 
the cost and availability of freight to transport product from location to location is also a factor in determining the success of commodity trading s business 
from time to time  commodity trading utilizes the asset base of seacor s other business units  primarily inland river services  for the transportation of product 
markets commodity trading s activities are global and dependent upon factors that commodity trading cannot control  including macro and micro supply and demand factors  governmental intervention or mandates  weather patterns  and the price and availability of substitute products 
with respect to rice and sugar  the primary markets in which commodity trading operates are countries that are net importers of these agricultural products and include countries in south america  the caribbean and africa 
with respect to the energy group  commodity trading purchases  markets and sells ethanol to customers for blending into the us gasoline pool and transports clean blendstocks for export 
the energy group marketed biodiesel for export to europe during the first half of the availability of agricultural commodities is affected by weather  plant diseases  governmental policies and agricultural growing patterns 
rice demand is affected by growth in worldwide consumption of food products  population growth  changes in per capita income  the relative prices of substitute agricultural products and demand generated by beer consumption as rice is a significant input in the brewing process 
sugar demand is affected by growth in worldwide consumption of food products as well as soft drinks and sweetened beverages  population growth  changes in per capita income and the relative prices of substitute sweeteners 
ethanol demand is subject to overall gasoline demand and gasoline blending economics  governmental policies and mandates  the cost of the production of feedstock commodities such as corn and sugar  gasoline and oil prices  freight and handling costs 
the demand for the clean blendstocks handled by the energy group depends primarily on oil and natural gas liquids prices

table of contents offshore marine services  marine transportation services and inland river services are subject to the shipping act   as amended act  and the merchant marine act of  as amended act  or jones act and  together with the act  shipping acts  which govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of vessels used to carry cargo between us ports known as us coastwise trade 
the shipping acts require that vessels engaged in us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the united states 
for a corporation engaged in the us coastwise trade to be deemed a us citizen i the corporation must be organized under the laws of the united states or of a state  territory or possession thereof  ii each of the chief executive officer and the chairman of the board of directors of such corporation must be a us citizen  iii no more than a minority of the number of directors of such corporation necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business can be non us citizens and iv at least of the interest in such corporation must be owned by us citizens as defined in the shipping acts 
should the company fail to comply with the us citizenship requirements of the shipping acts  it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in the us coastwise trade during the period of such non compliance 
to facilitate compliance with the shipping acts  seacor s restated certificate of incorporation i limits the aggregate percentage ownership by non us citizens of any class of the seacor s capital stock including the common stock to of the outstanding shares of each such class to ensure that such foreign ownership will not exceed the maximum percentage permitted by applicable maritime law presently but authorizes seacor s board of directors  under certain circumstances  to increase the foregoing percentage to  ii requires institution of a dual stock certification system to help determine such ownership and iii permits the board of directors to make such determinations as reasonably may be necessary to ascertain such ownership and implement such limitations 
in addition  seacor s by laws provide that the number of foreign directors shall not exceed a minority of the number necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and restrict any officer who is not a us citizen from acting in the absence or disability of the chairman of the board of directors and the chief executive officer and the president 
aviation services helicopters operating in the united states are subject to registration and citizenship requirements under the federal aviation act 
that act requires that before an aircraft may be legally operated in the united states  it must be owned by citizens of the united states  which  in the case of a corporation  means a corporation i organized under the laws of the united states or of a state  territory or possession thereof  ii of which at least of its voting interests are owned or controlled by persons who are us citizens as defined in the federal aviation act and regulations promulgated thereunder  and iii of which the president and at least two thirds of the board of directors and managing officers are us citizens 
all of marine transportation services and inland river services vessels and the majority of offshore marine services vessels are registered in the united states 
offshore marine services also operates vessels registered in a number of foreign jurisdictions 
vessels registered in these jurisdictions are subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction as to ownership  registration  manning and safety 
in addition  the vessels are subject to the requirements of a number of international conventions that are applicable to vessels depending on their jurisdiction of registration 
among the more significant of these conventions are i the protocol relating to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships  ii the international convention on the safety of life at sea  and protocols  and iii the international convention on standards of training  certification and watchkeeping for seafarers  the company believes that its vessels registered in foreign jurisdictions are in compliance with all applicable material regulations and have all licenses necessary to conduct their business 
in addition  vessels operated as standby safety vessels in the north sea are subject to the requirements of the department of transport of the united kingdom pursuant to the united kingdom safety act 
all of marine transportation services  harbor and offshore towing services  certain of offshore marine services vessels and all of inland river services liquid tank barges are subject to periodic inspection and survey by  and drydocking and maintenance requirements of  the uscg and or the american bureau of shipping and other marine classification societies 
moreover  to insure compliance with applicable safety regulations  the uscg is authorized to inspect vessels at will 

table of contents nrc is classified by the uscg as an osro for every port in the continental united states  hawaii and the caribbean 
the osro classification process is strictly voluntary 
vessel owners and other customers subject to opa who utilize classified osros are exempt from the requirement to list their response resources in their plans 
the classification process permits the uscg and these customers to evaluate the ability of an osro to respond to and recover oil spills of various types and sizes in different operating environments and geographic locations 
in addition to the uscg  the epa  the office of pipeline safety  the mms and certain individual states regulate vessels  facilities and pipelines in accordance with the requirements of opa or under analogous state law 
there is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies 
when responding to third party oil spills  environmental services enjoys immunity from liability under federal law and some state laws for any spills arising from its response efforts  except in the event of death or personal injury as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct 
environmental compliance as more fully described below  all of the company s businesses are  to some degree  subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health  including laws that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunctions or other sanctions 
the company believes that its operations are currently in compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations 
it does not expect that it will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future that are material to its financial position or operations to comply with environmental laws and regulations  however  because such laws and regulations are frequently changing and may impose increasingly strict requirements  the company cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations 
the recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards  and it is the company s view that this trend is likely to continue 
opa establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills 
opa applies to owners and operators of facilities operating near navigable waters and owners and operators of vessels operating in us waters  which include the navigable waters of the united states and the mile exclusive economic zone of the united states 
although it appears to apply in general to all vessels  for purposes of its liability limits and financial responsibility and response planning requirements  opa differentiates between tank vessels which include the company s chemical and petroleum product vessels and other vessels which include the company s tugs  offshore marine vessels and dry cargo barges 
under opa  owners and operators of regulated facilities and owners and operators or certain charterers of vessels are responsible parties and are jointly  severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of certain third parties under specified circumstances  an act of god or an act of war 
damages are defined broadly to include i injury to natural resources and the costs of remediation thereof  ii injury to  or economic losses resulting from the destruction of  real and personal property  iii net loss by the united states government  a state or political subdivision thereof  of taxes  royalties  rents  fees and profits  iv lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage  v net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response  such as protection from fire  safety or other hazards  and vi loss of subsistence use of available natural resources 
the statutory liability of responsible parties for tank vessels is limited to the greater of  per gross ton or million million for a vessel of  gross tons or less per vessel  for any other vessel  such liability is limited to the greater of per gross ton or  per vessel 
these liability limits do not apply a if an 
table of contents incident is caused by the responsible party s violation of federal safety  construction or operating regulations or by the responsible party s gross negligence or willful misconduct  b if the responsible party fails to report the incident or to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with oil removal activities as required by a responsible official or c if the responsible party fails to comply with certain governmental orders 
under opa  with certain limited exceptions  all newly built oil tankers carrying crude oil and petroleum products in us waters must have double hulls 
existing single hull  double side or double bottom tank vessels  unless retrofitted with double hulls  must be phased out of service by january   depending upon the vessel s size  age and place of discharge 
opa expanded pre existing financial responsibility requirements and requires tank vessel owners and operators to establish and maintain with the uscg evidence of insurance or qualification as a self insurer or other evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet their potential liabilities under opa the company has satisfied uscg regulations by providing evidence of financial responsibility demonstrated by commercial insurance and self insurance 
the regulations also implement the financial responsibility requirements of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  described below  which imposes liability for discharges of hazardous substances such as chemicals  in an amount equal to per gross ton  thus increasing the overall financial responsibility in the case of tank vessels from  to  per gross ton 
opa also amended the clean water act cwa  also described below  to require the owner or operator of certain facilities or of a tank vessel to prepare facility or vessel response plans and to contract with oil spill removal organizations to remove  to the maximum extent practicable  a worst case discharge 
the company has complied with these requirements 
the company expects its pollution liability insurance to cover any cost of spill removal subject to overall coverage limitations of billion  however  a failure or refusal of the insurance carrier to provide coverage in the event of a catastrophic spill could result in material liability in excess of available insurance coverage  resulting in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial position 
opa allows states to impose their own liability regimes with respect to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries and many states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills 
some states have issued regulations addressing financial responsibility and vessel and facility response planning requirements 
the company does not anticipate that state legislation or regulations will have any material impact on its operations 
in addition to opa  the following are examples of environmental laws that relate to the company s business and operations the federal cwa and comparable state and local laws impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the united states 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
a related statute  the coastal zone management act  authorizes state development and implementation of programs to manage non point source pollution to restore and protect coastal waters 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state and local laws regulate the generation  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and certain non hazardous wastes 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
the company s operations may generate or  in some cases  result in the transportation of these regulated wastes 
cercla and comparable state laws establish strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liabilities for specified parties in connection with liability for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and damages to natural resources 

table of contents the federal clean air act and comparable state and local laws impose restrictions on the emission of air pollutants into the atmosphere 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
the company s chemical and petroleum product carrier vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements when loading  unloading  ballasting  cleaning and conducting other operations in certain ports and are equipped with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements in all material respects 
the company manages exposure to losses from the above described laws through its efforts to use only well maintained  well managed and well equipped facilities and vessels  and its development of safety and environmental programs  including a maritime compliance program and its insurance program 
the company believes it will be able to accommodate reasonably foreseeable environmental regulatory changes 
there can be no assurance  however  that any future regulations or requirements or that any discharge or emission of pollutants by the company will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial position 
security heightened awareness of security needs brought about by the events of september  has caused the uscg  the imo and port states to adopt heightened security procedures relating to vessels and port facilities 
the company has updated its procedures in light of the new requirements 
in  congress passed the maritime transportation security act mtsa  which together with the imo s recent security proposals collectively known as the international ship and port facility security code or isps  requires specific security plans for the company s vessels and rigorous crew identification requirements 
the following vessels are subject to the requirements of the isps us flag vessels operating in the jones act trade that are at least gross registered tons us flag vessels operating on an international voyage foreign flag vessels that are at least gross tons under the international tonnage convention the company has implemented vessel security plans and procedures for each of its us flag vessels pursuant to rules implementing the mtsa which have been issued by the uscg 
the company anticipates that the costs of security for its business will continue to increase 
the company s us flag vessels  subject to the requirements of the isps  all foreign flag vessels and us flag vessels  operating on international voyages  were in compliance with the isps requirements effective july  industry hazards and insurance vessel operations involve inherent risks associated with carrying large volumes of cargo and rendering services in a marine environment 
in addition  helicopter operations are potentially hazardous and may result in incidents or accidents 
hazards include adverse weather conditions  collisions  fire and mechanical failures  which may result in death or injury to personnel  damage to equipment  loss of operating revenues  contamination of cargo  pollution and other environmental damages and increased costs 
the company maintains marine and aviation hull  liability and war risk  general liability  workers compensation and other insurance customary in the industries in which the company operates 
the company also conducts training and safety programs to promote a safe working environment and minimize hazards 

table of contents employees as of december   the company employed  individuals either directly or indirectly through crewing or manning agreements 
substantially all indirect employees support offshore marine services vessel operations 
as of december   offshore marine services employed seafarers in the north sea  some of whom were members of a union under the terms of an ongoing agreement 
in the united states  a total of employees in marine transportation services and harbor and offshore towing services are unionized under agreements that expire at varying times through september  certain individuals in environmental services are also represented by unions 
management considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory 

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flow can be adversely affected by numerous risks 
carefully consider the risks described below  which represent some of the more critical risk factors that affect the company  as well as the other information that has been provided in this annual report on form k 
the risks described below are not the exclusive risks faced by the company 
additional risks not presently known may also impair the company s business operations 
difficult economic conditions could materially adversely affect the company 
the success of the company s business is both directly and indirectly dependent upon conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world that are outside its control and difficult to predict 
uncertainty about global economic conditions may lead businesses to postpone spending in response to tighter credit and reductions in income or asset values  which has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
these factors may adversely affect the company s liquidity and financial condition including the failure of lenders participating in the company s revolving credit facility to fulfill their commitments and obligations  and the liquidity and financial condition of the company s customers 
tight credit conditions could limit the company s ability to secure additional financing  if required  due to difficulties in accessing the capital markets 
factors such as interest rates  availability of credit  inflation rates  economic uncertainty  changes in laws including laws relating to taxation  trade barriers  commodity prices  currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances including wars  terrorist acts or security operations can also have a material negative impact on the company s business and investments  which in turn would reduce its revenues and profitability 
although the company has some exposure to credit risks on its accounts receivable  these risks are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
the company has procedures that are designed to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its receivables  however  there can be no assurance that such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
the unstable current economic conditions may also increase the volatility of the company s stock price 
demand for many of the company s services is impacted by the level of activity in the offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production industry 
the level of offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity has historically been volatile and that volatility is likely to continue 
the level of activity is subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in a variety of factors that are beyond the company s control  including prevailing oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices and price volatility the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and natural gas offshore worldwide demand for energy and other petroleum products as well as chemical products availability and rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas local and international political and economic conditions and policies including cabotage and local content laws technological advances affecting energy production and consumption weather conditions environmental regulation the ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate or otherwise obtain funds for capital 
table of contents a prolonged material downturn in oil and natural gas prices is likely to cause a substantial decline in expenditures for exploration  development and production activity 
lower levels of expenditure and activity would result in a decline in demand and lower rates for the company s offshore energy support services and tanker services 
moreover  approximately of offshore marine services and of aviation services are currently conducted in the us gulf of mexico and are therefore dependent on levels of activity in that region  which may differ from levels of activity in other regions of the world 
adverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the company 
the company is subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of its business 
results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
irrespective of its merits  litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to the company s operations and cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention 
the company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the company s financial condition and operating results should the company fail to prevail in certain matters 
risks from the company s international operations 
the company operates vessels  leases helicopters  provides environmental services and transacts other business worldwide 
its ability to compete in the international offshore energy support market and environmental services market may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors  or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
further  the company s foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company 
activity outside the united states involves additional risks  including the possibility of united states embargoes  restrictive actions by foreign governments  including asset seizure foreign taxation and changes in foreign tax laws limitations on the repatriation of earnings local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements nationalization and expropriation loss of contract rights political instability  war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets changes in currency exchange rates unstable political  military and economic conditions in foreign countries where a significant proportion of offshore marine services operations are conducted could adversely impact the company s business 
during the year ended december   approximately of offshore marine services operating revenues resulted from its foreign operations 
these operations are subject to risks  including potential vessel seizure  terrorist attacks  piracy  kidnapping  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions  import or export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation  all of which are beyond the company s control 
economic sanctions or an oil embargo  for example  could have significant impact on activity in the oil and gas industry and  correspondingly  on the company should offshore marine services operate vessels in a country subject to any sanctions or embargo  or in the surrounding region to the extent any sanctions or embargo disrupt its operations 

table of contents offshore marine services  marine transportation services and aviation services rely on several customers for a significant share of their revenues  the loss of any of which could adversely affect each of their businesses and operating results 
offshore marine services  marine transportation services and aviation services customers are primarily major oil companies and large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies 
the portion of offshore marine services  marine transportation services or aviation services revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by any such customer  their ability to meet the customer s needs and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
consolidation of the company s customer base could adversely affect demand for its services and reduce its revenues 
oil and natural gas companies  energy companies and drilling contractors have recently undergone substantial consolidation and additional consolidation is possible 
consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for the company s services 
also  merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration  development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs 
less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed 
such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation  which would adversely affect demand for the company s offshore marine services vessels  marine transportation services tankers  aviation services helicopters and environmental services products and services  thereby reducing the company s revenues 
the company may be unable to maintain or replace its vessels as they age 
as of december   the average age of the company s offshore marine services owned vessels  excluding its standby safety vessels  was approximately years 
the company believes that after an offshore support vessel has been in service for approximately years  the expense which typically increases with age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
the company may be unable to carry out drydockings of its vessels or may be limited by insufficient shipyard capacity  which could adversely affect its ability to maintain its vessels 
in addition  market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable the company to operate its older vessels profitably during the remainder of their economic lives 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels  or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels 
an increase in the supply of offshore support vessels or tankers could have an adverse impact on the charter rates earned by the company s offshore support vessels and tankers 
expansion of the supply of the worldwide offshore support vessel fleet would increase competition in the markets where offshore marine services operates 
the refurbishment of disused or mothballed vessels  conversion of vessels from uses other than oil and gas exploration and production support and related activities or construction of new vessels could all add vessel capacity to current worldwide levels 
a significant increase in vessel capacity could lower charter rates and result in lower operating revenues 
similarly  should competitors in the domestic petroleum and chemical product tankers industry construct a significant number of new tankers or large capacity integrated or articulated tug and barge units  demand for tanker assets could be adversely affected 
if the company does not restrict the amount of foreign ownership of its common stock  it could be prohibited from operating offshore support vessels  inland river vessels and barges and tankers in parts of the united states and could be prohibited from operating helicopters  which would adversely impact its business and operating results 
the company is subject to the shipping act   as amended  and the merchant marine act of  as amended jones act and  together with the act  shipping acts  which govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of offshore support vessels  tankers and barges used to carry cargo between us ports 
the shipping acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the united states 
the company is also subject to regulations pursuant to the federal aviation act of  as amended federal aviation act  and other statutes aviation acts 
generally  
table of contents aircraft operating in the united states must be registered in the united states 
in order to register such aircraft under the aviation acts  the company must be owned or controlled by us citizens 
although the company s certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the shipping acts  and also comply with the aviation acts  the company would be prohibited from operating vessels in the us coastwise trade and helicopters in the united states during any period in which the company did not comply with these regulations 
repeal  amendment  suspension or failure to enforce the jones act would result in additional competition for offshore marine services  marine transportation services and inland river services 
a substantial portion of offshore marine services  marine transportation services and inland river services operations are conducted in the us coastwise trade 
under the jones act  this trade is restricted to vessels built in the united states  owned and manned by us citizens and registered under united states law 
there have been attempts to repeal or amend the jones act  and these attempts are expected to continue in the future 
repeal of the jones act could result in additional competition from vessels built in lower cost foreign shipyards and owned and manned by foreign nationals with promotional foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than us citizens  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the outer continental shelf lands act  as amended  provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and gas 
because offshore marine services operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production  the government s exercise of authority under the provisions of the outer continental shelf lands act to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
failure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on the company s ability to retain customers 
the company s customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider 
the company must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to its customers 
should this not be achieved  the ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected 
operational risks could disrupt operations and expose the company to liability 
the operation of offshore support vessels  tankers  tugs  helicopters and emergency response vessels and barges is subject to various risks  including catastrophic disaster  adverse weather  mechanical failure and collision 
additional risks relating to the operation of helicopters include harsh weather and marine conditions  mechanical failures  crashes and collisions  which may result in personal injury  loss of life  damage to property and equipment and suspension or reduction of operations 
the company s aircraft have been involved in accidents in the past  some of which have included loss of life and property damage 
the company may experience similar accidents in the future 
additional risks to vessels include adverse sea conditions  capsizing  grounding  oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors 
these risks could endanger the safety of the company s personnel  equipment  cargo and other property  as well as the environment 
if any of these events were to occur  the company could be held liable for resulting damages  including loss of revenues from or termination of charter contracts  higher insurance rates  and damage to the company s reputation and customer relationships 
in addition  the affected vessels or helicopters could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenues 
revenues from aviation services are subject to adverse weather conditions and seasonality 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from aviation services is dependent on actual flight hours 
prolonged periods of adverse weather  storms and the effect of fewer hours of daylight adversely impact aviation services 
winter months generally have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year with poor visibility  high winds  heavy precipitation and fewer daylight hours  all of which adversely affect helicopter operations 
june through november is tropical storm season in the us gulf of mexico  during tropical storms  helicopters are unable to operate in the area of a storm 
in addition  many of aviation services facilities are located along the us gulf of mexico coast  and tropical storms may cause damage to its property 

table of contents the aircraft industry is subject to intense competition 
the helicopter industry is highly competitive and involves an aggressive bidding process among providers having the necessary equipment  operational experience and resources 
aviation services must provide safe and efficient service or risk losing customers or the termination of contracts  which could result in lost market share and may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of its operations 
consolidation in the aircraft parts industry could affect the service and operation of aviation services helicopters 
a reduction in the number of approved parts suppliers or a consolidation of the spare parts redistribution market could interrupt or delay the supply of aircraft components  adversely affect aviation services ability to meet service commitments to customers and could cause aviation services to lose opportunities with existing and future customers 
aviation services might not be able to qualify or identify alternative suppliers in a timely fashion  or at all 
consolidations involving suppliers could further reduce the number of alternatives for aviation services and affect the cost of components 
an increase in the cost of components could make aviation services less competitive and result in lower margins 
revenues from marine transportation services could be adversely affected by a decline in demand for domestic refined petroleum products  crude oil or chemical products  or a change in existing methods of delivery 
the demand for the company s services is influenced by the level of refinery capacity in the united states 
a reduction in domestic consumption of refined petroleum products  crude oil or chemical products may adversely affect marine transportation services revenues 
moreover  alternative methods of delivery of refined petroleum  natural gas or crude oil may be developed and therefore reduce demand for the company s services 
finally  a reduction in domestic refining capacity would reduce demand for the company s services 
construction of additional refined petroleum product  natural gas or crude oil pipelines could have a material adverse effect on marine transportation services revenues 
long haul transportation of refined petroleum products  crude oil and natural gas is generally less costly by pipeline than by tanker 
existing pipeline systems are either insufficient to meet demand in  or do not reach all of  the markets served by marine transportation services tankers 
new pipeline segments are being planned and approved for the florida market 
the construction and operation of these pipelines could have an adverse effect on marine transportation services business 
the company may have to phase out its double bottom tanker from petroleum product transportation service in united states waters 
the oil pollution act of establishes a phase out schedule  depending upon vessel size and age  for non double hull vessels carrying crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation 
the phase out date for the company s non double hull tanker  the seabulk america  is and unless this vessel is modified with a double hull  which will require substantial capital expenditure  it will be prohibited from transporting crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation after this date 
it would also be prohibited from transporting petroleum products in most foreign and international markets under a phase out schedule established by the international maritime organization 
the company may lose eligibility for two tankers retrofitted to a double hull configuration to engage in us coastwise trade 
two of marine transportation services tankers that operate in the us coastwise trade  which is restricted to vessels built or rebuilt in the united states  were retrofitted to a double hull configuration in a foreign shipyard 
the company is party to litigation regarding the eligibility of such tankers following the retrofit to engage in the us coastwise trade  the loss of which could adversely after the company s financial condition and its results of operations 
see item legal proceedings for a complete description of this litigation 
the company is subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international laws and regulations governing worker safety and health and the manning  construction and operation of vessels significantly affect the company s operations 
many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the us coast guard uscg  occupational safety and 
table of contents health administration osha  the national transportation safety board ntsb and the us customs service  to regulation by port states and class society organizations such as the american bureau of shipping  and to international regulations from international treaties such as the safety of life at sea convention administered by port states and class societies 
the uscg  the osha and the ntsb set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
the us customs service and the uscg are authorized to inspect vessels at will 
the company s business and operations are also subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of oil and hazardous materials into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection and occupational safety and health 
compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes  and the phase out of certain product tankers 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of the company s operations 
some environmental laws impose strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous materials and damage to natural resources  which could subject the company to liability without regard to whether it was negligent or at fault 
these laws and regulations may expose the company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  including charterers

emergency response revenue is subject to significant volatility 
environmental services response revenues are event driven and can vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on the number and magnitude of responses 
as a result  environmental services profitability may also vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
a relaxation of oil spill regulation or enforcement could reduce demand for environmental services emergency response services 
environmental services is dependent upon the enforcement of regulations promulgated under opa  international conventions and  to a lesser extent  upon local regulations 
less stringent emergency regulations or less aggressive enforcement of these regulations would decrease demand for environmental services emergency response services 
there can be no assurance that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent 
if this happens  the demand for environmental services emergency response services could be adversely impacted 
a change in  or revocation of  national response corporation s classification as an oil spill removal organization would result in a loss of business 
the national response corporation nrc is classified by the uscg as an oil spill removal organization osro 
the uscg classifies osros based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills 
uscg classified osros have a competitive advantage over non classified service providers because customers of a classified osro are exempt from regulations that would otherwise require them to list their oil spill response resources in filings with the uscg 
a loss of nrc s classification or changes in the requirements for classification could eliminate or diminish nrc s ability to provide customers with this exemption 
if this happens  environmental services could lose customers 
environmental services could incur liability in connection with providing spill response services 
although environmental services generally is exempt in the united states from liability under the clean water act cwa for its own actions and omissions in providing spill response services  this exemption might not apply if it were found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct  or if it were to have failed to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the cwa 
in addition  the exemption under the federal cwa would not protect environmental services against liability for personal injury or wrongful death  or against prosecution under other federal or state laws 
while most of the states within the united states in which environmental services provides services have adopted similar 
table of contents exemptions  several states have not 
if a court or other applicable authority were to determine that environmental services does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing emergency response services  environmental services could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages  including damages caused by others 
in the international market  environmental services does not benefit from the spill response liability protection provided by the cwa and therefore is subject to the liability terms and conditions negotiated with its international clients 
inland river services could experience variation in freight rates 
freight transportation rates may fluctuate as the volume of cargo and availability of barges changes 
volume of freight transported on the us inland river waterways may vary as a result of various factors  such as global economic conditions and business cycles  domestic and international agricultural production and demand and foreign currency exchange rates 
barge participation in the industry can also vary year to year and is dependent on the number of barges built and retired from service 
extended periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations could be adversely affected by the decline in united states grain exports 
inland river services business is significantly affected by the volume of grain exports handled through us gulf of mexico ports 
grain exports can vary due to a number of factors including the crop harvest yield levels in the united states and abroad  and the demand for grain in the united states 
the shortage of available grain overseas can increase demand for us grain 
conversely  an abundance of grain overseas can decrease demand for us grain 
a decline in exports could result in excess barge capacity  which would likely lower freight rates earned by inland river services 
inland river services results of operations could be adversely affected by international economic and political factors 
the actions of foreign governments could affect the import and export of the dry bulk commodities typically transported by inland river services 
foreign trade agreements and each country s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for us imports and exports of the dry bulk commodities inland river services transports 
national and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or us imports or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates will affect the demand for transportation of the cargos inland river services transports 
these actions or developments could have an adverse impact on inland river services 
inland river services results of operations are affected by seasonal activity 
inland river services business is seasonal  and its quarterly revenues and profits have historically been lower during the first and second quarters of the year and higher during the third and fourth quarters during the grain harvest 
inland river services results of operations are affected by adverse weather and river conditions 
weather patterns can affect river levels and cause ice conditions during winter months  which can hamper barge navigation 
locks on river systems may be closed for maintenance or other causes  which may delay barge movements 
these conditions could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fuel price fluctuations 
for the most part  inland river services purchases towboat and fleeting services from third party vendors 
the price of these services can rise when fuel prices escalate and could adversely impact inland river services results of operations 
the company s insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect it from the liabilities that could arise in its businesses 
although the company maintains insurance coverage against the risks related to its businesses  risks may arise for which it may not be insured 
claims covered by insurance are subject to deductibles  the aggregate amount of which could be material 
insurance policies are also subject to compliance with certain conditions  the failure of which could lead to a denial of coverage as to a particular claim or the voiding of a particular insurance policy 
there also can be no assurance that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  the company could be exposed to substantial liability 

table of contents the company s global operations are subject to certain foreign currency  interest rate  fixed income  equity and commodity price risks 
the company is exposed to certain foreign currency  interest rate  fixed income  equity and commodity price risks 
some of these risks may be hedged  but fluctuations could impact the company s financial position 
volatility in international currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the company s operating results 
the company has  and anticipates that it will continue to receive  contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
it is often not practicable for the company to effectively hedge the entire risk of significant changes in currency rates during the contract period 
the company s operating results have been negatively impacted for certain periods and positively impacted for other periods and may continue to be affected to a material extent by the impact of currency fluctuations 
operating results may also be affected by the cost of hedging activities that the company undertakes 
the company holds a large proportion of its net assets in cash equivalents and short term investments  including a variety of public and private debt and equity instruments 
such investments subject the company to the risks generally inherent in the capital markets 
given the relatively high proportion of the company s liquid assets relative to its overall size  the results of its operations may be materially affected by the results of the company s capital management and investment activities and the risks associated with those activities 
the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty also increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on the company s debt and equity instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 
in addition  changes in interest rates may have an adverse impact on the company s results of its operations 
investment in new business strategies and initiatives may present risks not originally contemplated 
the company has invested  and in the future may invest  in new business plans or acquisitions 
these activities may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including distraction of management from current operations  insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with a plan or acquisitions  inadequate return of capital  and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence 
as a result of the risks inherent in new ventures  there can be no assurance that any such venture will be successful  or that new ventures will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of its operations 
commodity trading s results of operations may be materially adversely affected by the availability  demand and price of agricultural commodities  weather  disease  government programs  and competition 
the availability and price of agricultural commodities may fluctuate widely due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government programs and policies  changes in global demand resulting from population growth and changes in standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
reduced supply of agricultural commodities due to weather related factors or other reasons could adversely affect profitability 
reduced supplies of agricultural commodities could limit the ability to procure  transport  store and merchandise agricultural commodities in an efficient manner 
in addition  the availability and price of agricultural commodities can be affected by other factors  such as plant disease  which can result in crop failures and reduced harvests 
commodity trading is subject to economic downturns  political instability and other risks of doing business globally  which could adversely affect operating results 
commodity trading conducts its business in many countries and geographic areas  and plans to expand its business in emerging market areas such as asia  africa and parts of the caribbean 
both developed and emerging market areas are subject to economic downturns and emerging market areas could be subject to more volatile economic  political and market conditions 
such economic downturns and volatile conditions may have a negative impact on commodity trading s ability to execute its business strategies and on its operating results 
commodity trading s results of operations also could be affected by changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  and other activities of governments  agencies  and similar organizations  including political conditions  trade regulations affecting production  pricing and marketing of products  local labor conditions and regulations  burdensome taxes and tariffs  enforceability of legal agreements and judgments  and other trade barriers 
commodity trading is subject to government policies and regulations  in general  and specifically those affecting the agricultural sector and related industries  which could adversely affect its operating results 
agricultural production and trade flows are subject to government policies and regulations 
governmental 
table of contents policies affecting the agricultural industry  such as taxes  tariffs  duties  subsidies  incentives and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products  can influence the planting of certain crops  the location and size of crop production  whether unprocessed or processed commodity products are traded  the volume and types of imports and exports  the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials  and industry profitability 
in addition  international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions 
future government policies may adversely affect the supply of  demand for  and prices of commodity trading s products  restrict its ability to do business in its existing and target markets  and could negatively impact revenues and operating results 
commodity trading is subject to numerous laws and regulations globally which could adversely affect operating results 
commodity trading is required to comply with the numerous and broad reaching laws and regulations administered by united states federal  state  local  and foreign governmental agencies relating to  but not limited to  the sourcing  transporting  storing and merchandising of agricultural commodities and products 
any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject commodity trading to administrative penalties and injunctive relief  civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  and recalls of its products 
commodity trading s risk management strategies may not be effective 
commodity trading s business is affected by fluctuations in agricultural commodity prices  transportation costs  energy prices  interest rates  and foreign currency exchange rates 
although commodity trading may engage in hedging transactions to manage these risks  such transactions may not be successful in mitigating its exposure to these fluctuations and may adversely affect operating results 
the company s inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on its business 
attracting and retaining skilled personnel across all of the company s business segments is an important factor in its future success 
the market for personnel is highly competitive and the company cannot be certain that it will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the future 
the failure to successfully complete construction  conversion  repairs  maintenance or routine drydockings of the company s vessels on schedule and on budget could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  the company may have a number of vessels under conversion and may plan to construct or convert other vessels in response to current and future market conditions 
the company also routinely engages shipyards to drydock vessels for regulatory compliance and to provide repair and maintenance 
construction and conversion projects and drydockings are subject to risks of delay and cost overruns  resulting from shortages of equipment  lack of shipyard availability  unforeseen engineering problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor 
a significant delay in either construction or drydockings could have a material adverse effect on contract commitments and revenues with respect to vessels under construction  conversion or for other drydockings 
significant cost overruns or delays for vessels under construction  conversion or retrofit could also adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
a violation of the foreign corrupt practices act may adversely affect the company s business and operations 
in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions  the company seeks to establish joint ventures with local operators or strategic partners 
as a us corporation  the company is subject to the regulations imposed by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining business 
the company has adopted stringent procedures to enforce compliance with the fcpa  but it may be held liable for actions taken by its strategic or local partners even though these partners may not be subject to the fcpa 
any determination that the company has violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations
