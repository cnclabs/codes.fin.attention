in addition  broadband operating revenues increased due to the continued expansion of the broadband network and growth in the demand for digital video  voice and data offered as a bundled triple play package 
the introduction of our voip digital phone product in the sacramento market  including the telecom segment service territory  has resulted in an elevated take rate and an increase in broadband residential triple play rgus  while successfully mitigating access line losses in the telecom segment by migrating these customers to voice rgus in the broadband segment 
at december   broadband voice rgus in the sacramento market increased compared to the prior year 
we will continue to invest in success based capital and building and deploying the broadband infrastructure primarily within the kansas city area  while focusing on the generation of new customers and increasing residential penetration on existing marketable homes 
operating revenues in the telecom segment decreased  in compared to residential revenues accounted for  of the decrease in residential services were largely impacted by our customer s migration toward alternative communication services  including those offered by our broadband segment  which contributed to an approximate decline in the telecom segment voice rgus as of december  compared to in an effort to mitigate future operating revenue and voice rgu declines  we offer various flat rate and bundled service packages and have introduced a broadband voip service to customer s residing within surewest telephone s service area 
the decrease in operating revenues was also impacted by the anticipated scheduled reduction in california high cost fund chcf subsidies of approximately  during compared to see the regulatory matters section within the telecom segment result of operations section below  for a further discussion regarding the regulatory subsidies we receive 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization and loss on impairment of local multipoint distribution system lmds  increased  in compared to our broadband segment accounted for substantially all of the increases in our consolidated operating expenses primarily as a result of the addition of our kansas city operations  which accounted for  of the current year increase

general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to mostly as a result of the addition of our kansas city operations 
excluding the addition of the operations for kansas city  which accounted for  of the year over year increase  general and administrative expenses declined from the prior year period primarily as a result of i a decline in legal fees due to additional 
table of contents fees incurred in the prior year related to regulatory matters and ii a decrease in salaries and wages from a reduction in headcount and overhead costs  partially offset by an increase in consulting and advisory fees related to strategic initiatives 
the increase in the consolidated operating expenses in compared to the was offset by a decline in the costs associated with our defined benefit pension plan the pension plan  supplemental executive retirement plan and certain post retirement benefits other than pensions other benefits plan collectively the plans 
during  we substantially modified our employee compensation structure in order to attract and retain the right mix of talent necessary to successfully support a company which is significantly expanding and growing 
as a result  we amended the plans  effective april   which froze the pension plan so that no person is eligible to become a new participant in the plans on or following that date and all future benefit accruals for existing participants under the plans cease 
the amendments to the plans were accounted for as plan curtailments  resulting in the recognition of a non cash pretax curtailment loss per share which was reflected in the operating expenses in our consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter ended december  as a result of the amendments to the plans and final actuarial calculations  consolidated operating expenses decreased during the year ended december   compared to and  during compared to see note for more information on the plans

the increase in asset lives primarily ranged between to years 
during  this change in estimate decreased consolidated depreciation expense by  and increased consolidated net income by  per share 
in  we determined that we will no longer devote significant resources to our residential and business wireless service offerings that utilize the lmds line of site technology 
the decision to no longer pursue this component of the data services is due to our strategic change in the focus toward land based network systems 
as a result  during  we incurred a pre tax  non cash impairment charge on our lmds licenses and related network assets 
reclassifications certain amounts in our and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements  which primarily consists of the effects of reclassifications from presentation of our wireless and tower businesses as discontinued operations 
in addition  the calculation of certain select operating metrics has been revised over time to reflect the current view of our business 
accordingly  where necessary  prior period metric calculations have been revised to conform to current practice 
revenue and cost structure we expect that the sources of our revenues and our cost structure may be different in future periods  as a result of our entry into new communications markets  the disposition of non strategic investments and regulatory and competitive forces in each of the markets in which we have operations

in an ongoing proceeding relating to the new regulatory framework under which surewest telephone has been regulated since  the cpuc adopted decision in  which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services  bundling of services  promotions and customer contracts 
this decision adopted a new regulatory framework  the uniform regulatory framework urf  which among other things i eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services except lifeline and basic residential services which will remain capped at current levels until january   ii allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services  iii allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and iv eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation  including the calculation of shareable earnings 
on september   the cpuc adopted decision  which allows urf incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs to increase their basic residential rate by up to per year over the next two years 
beginning january   the urf ilecs will be allowed full pricing flexibility for the basic residential rate 
in addition  the division of ratepayer advocates and the utility reform network have recently submitted various filings to the cpuc in an effort to extend the price freeze on basic residential rates for three years and to determine through further review and public hearings if full pricing flexibility will ensure the availability of affordable  reliable basic residential telephone service

as a result  during  we incurred a pre tax  non cash impairment charge on our lmds licenses and related network assets 
depreciation and amortization decreased in compared to depreciation expense in the broadband segment increased due to the continued network build out and success based capital projects undertaken within the residential broadband service territories  however the increase was entirely offset by a change in accounting estimate recorded during  as discussed below 
during the first quarter of  we completed our triennial review of asset lives which evaluated the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment for all segments 
the evaluation considered our investment and business strategy  reliability and historical performance data of certain assets  as well as the impacts of competition and anticipated technological change 
as a result of this evaluation  effective january   we increased the estimated useful lives of certain customer premise equipment  circuit equipment and cable plant primarily in the broadband segment

cost of services and products exclusive of depreciation and amortization decreased by and customer operations and selling expense decreased by in from the decrease in both of these categories was due primarily to the decrease in the plans previously discussed 
general and administrative expense increased  in compared to the increase in was due to an increase in information technology costs associated with various system enhancement and automation projects and associated maintenance contracts 
the remaining increase was substantially related to consulting and advisory fees associated with the commencement in of a project to evaluate the feasibility to outsource certain non core processes

the effective federal and state income tax rates for continuing operations were and for the years ended and  respectively 
the decrease in the tax rates in the current year period compared to the prior year period was due primarily to the reduction of the income tax liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and tax exempt interest income

liquidity and capital resources overview we generate a significant cash flow from operating activities 
the proceeds from monetizing our non strategic investments have also provided us with a significant source of cash flow 
we believe that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements  through our cash flow from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  through available borrowings under our existing credit facilities  and through our ability to obtain future external financing 
our primary use of cash in was for the acquisition of everest  capital expenditures  scheduled payments of long term debt including interest payments  planned share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends 
we anticipate continuing to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to fund our capital expenditures  invest in new business opportunities  fund network expansion and modernization  meet scheduled payments of long term debt and fund the authorized share repurchase plan

auction rate security at december   we held one  par value ars with an estimated fair value of  this ars is collateralized by student loans that are guaranteed primarily by a monoline insurance company and partially by the federal family education loan program ffelp 
historically  the ars market was highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every to days  to provide liquidity at par 
however  as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  the auctions for our ars failed beginning in february when sell orders exceeded buy orders 
we obtained a level valuation from an investment advisor  who utilized a discounted cash flow dcf approach to arrive at this valuation 
to support this valuation  we prepared a separate and comparable dcf model to estimate the fair value of the ars at december  the significant estimates that were used as inputs in our dcf model were the credit quality of the issuer  the credit quality of the monoline insurance company  the percentage and the types of guarantees such as the monoline insurance company and ffelp  interest rates  expected holding period of the ars  expected future cash flows  and an illiquidity discount factor 
this ars is compared  when possible  to other observable and relevant market data  which are non existent at this time 
changes in the assumptions of the model based on dynamic market conditions could have a significant impact on the valuation of this security  which may lead us in the future to take an impairment charge for this security 
based on our review of the investment advisors valuation  our dcf model  the inputs to the model and the assessment of fair value as of december   we determined there was a decline in the fair value of the ars investment of  accordingly  the decline in fair value has been recorded as a charge to the statement of income 
we will continue to analyze our ars each reporting period for additional changes in fair value and will record those gains or losses in the consolidated statement of income 
in november  we accepted the right from ubs  entitling us to sell at par value our ars originally purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  in accepting the right  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of the ars 
although we expect to sell our ars under the right  if the right is not exercised before july  it will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
in lieu of our acceptance of the right  ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
the enforceability of the right results in a put option and is recognized as a separate freestanding instrument that is accounted for separately from the ars investment 
we elected to account for this right at fair value under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas 
we valued the right using a dcf approach including estimates of  based on data available as of december   interest rates  timing and amount of cash flow  adjusted for any bearer risk associated with ubs s financial ability to repurchase the ars beginning june  any change in these assumptions and market conditions would affect the value of this right 
the value of the right of  which largely offsets the realized loss on the ars subject to the right is included in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  as long term investments and on the consolidated statement of income together with the realized loss on the ars subject to the right for the year ended december  as other income expense  other  net 
we believe that

cash flows used in investing activities 
net cash used in continuing investing activities during was  and was primarily attributable to the acquisition of everest for  net of cash acquired 
proceeds from sale of discontinued operations in may  we sold the operating assets of our wireless business  surewest wireless  to verizon for an aggregate cash purchase price of  a portion of the purchase price equal to  was placed in escrow  half of which will be available after twelve months and the balance of which will be available twenty four months following the closing 
see note for more information on the escrow 
proceeds from the sale of the wireless business were  in part  used to repay a portion of the credit agreement described below 
in  we received proceeds of  from the sale of of the stock of surewest directories  our directory publishing business 
the net proceeds from the sale were  in part  used to fund the acquisition of everest in on october   we entered into a purchase agreement to sell our fifty two owned tower assets owned by our subsidiary west coast pcs to global tower partners 
west coast pcs is a component of our broadband segment 
on february   the sale was completed for an aggregate cash purchase price of  based on the tower cash flow generated by commenced tenant leases 
we expect to use the net cash proceeds from the tower assets sale to repay a certain amount of our current outstanding long term debt 
capital expenditures capital expenditures continue to be our primary recurring investing activity and were   and  in  and  respectively 
we invest a significant portion of our capital spending in our broadband segment as a result of business growth  the introduction of new products and services and the expansion of the network 
the increase in capital expenditures in  compared to and  was due to the addition of the kansas city operations as we continue to expand and enhance the network within the kansas city area 
cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from short and long term borrowings offset by cash payments for dividends and planned repurchases of our common stock 
long term debt in may  the company and cobank entered into an amended and restated credit agreement old credit agreement to restate and replace the may credit agreement 
the old credit agreement revised both the term loan facility and the revolving loan facility collectively loan facilities to principal amounts of  and up to  respectively

on may   we repaid  of the term loan b and  of the revolving facility with proceeds from the sale of our wireless business 
in september  we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement new agreement to restate and replace the credit agreement 
the new agreement terms  among other things i reflected the repayment of  of the term loan b facility under the credit agreement to reduce the principal balance from  to  ii modified interest margins and iii extended the maturity date of the term loan b facility to may  the term loan a facility has  outstanding as of december   of which  bears a fixed interest rate of and the remaining  bears interest based  at our election  on libor or the bank s prime rate  in either case  plus an applicable margin

debt covenants our series a and series b senior notes and the new agreement contain financial and operating covenants that may restrict  among other things  the repurchase of the company s capital stock  the making of certain other restricted payments and the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
the covenants also require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum levels of tangible net worth 
at december  and  retained earnings of  and  respectively  were available for the payments described above 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
share repurchase program and dividends our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
shares are purchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  subject to overall financial and market conditions 
starting in the first quarter of through december   approximately million shares of common stock had been repurchased 
as of december   we had remaining authorization from the board of directors to repurchase approximately thousand additional outstanding shares 
we repurchased approximately thousand shares and thousand shares in and  respectively 
we did not repurchase any shares during the purchase of common shares did not have substantive effect on the average number of common shares outstanding or the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december   and in april  our board of directors announced the decision to discontinue dividend payments for the foreseeable future in an effort to foster our growth strategy by reinvesting the approximate  of annual dividend distributions back into the company 
the cash dividend of per share  paid on june  to shareholders of record at the close of business on may   was the last dividend paid

sufficiency of cash resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  of  we believe given our financial position and debt to equity position  that we have substantial additional long term borrowing capacity of approximately  available to us through our revolving loan facility 
the revolving loan facility is subject to mandatory reductions of  on december  and december   as reduced by any voluntary reductions of the revolving credit facility or prepayments or repayments of the term loan a or the term loan b facilities 
we believe our operating cash flows and our borrowing capacity are sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next twelve months  while maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents 
our most significant use of funds in is expected to be for i budgeted capital expenditures of  to  ii scheduled payments of long term debt of  iii anticipated interest payments of  and iv incentive compensation of approximately  as discussed above  throughout the year we may repurchase shares of the company s common stock in the open market at the prevailing market price up to an amount authorized by the board of directors 
a portion of the budgeted capital expenditures is at our discretion and dependent upon our working capital position  operating cash flows and ability to borrow 
we can modify our planned construction and commitments if the results of operations or available capital so require 
a significant portion of our budgeted capital expenditures are success based and is partially dependent on our ability to manage our growth and expansion 
we are required to comply with our cable franchise agreements to continue our build out in the franchise areas 
working capital our working capital deficit was  at december  the decrease in working capital during the twelve months ended december  was primarily attributable to the acquisition of everest in february for  as discussed in note the purchase of everest resulted in a decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and an increase in debt  as described above 
as noted above  in may we sold the operating assets of our wireless business for an aggregate cash purchase price of  and used  of the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of the credit agreement 
see notes and for more information regarding our wireless business and credit agreements 
other factors affecting working capital at december  were as follows i principal payments on our series b notes  which will commence in march  have been classified as short term  ii the repurchases of our common stock  iii the payment of dividends and iv the reclassification of our ars from short term to long term investments 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows thereafter total long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations unrecorded recorded liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties interest on long term debt includes amounts due on fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december    of the long term debt was subject to variable rates  as described above 
in determining our future interest obligations  we used the rates in effect at december  the weighted average rate was approximately 
unrecorded purchase obligations include binding commitments for future capital expenditures and services 
recorded obligations include amounts in accounts payable and accrued expenses for external goods and services received as of december  and expected to be settled in cash 
the settlement period for unrecognized tax benefits and potential interest and penalties of cannot be reasonably determined  however  the liabilities are not expected to become due within the next twelve months 
defined benefit pension plan as required  we contribute to the pension plan and other benefits plans  which provide retirement benefits to certain eligible employees of our california location 
contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date 
our funding policy is to contribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations 
as discussed in the consolidated overview section above  we stopped accruing benefits for active participants effective april  although the recent down turn in the economy and financial markets has contributed to the poor return on the plan assets in  we believe that future funding requirements will decrease significantly as a result of the freeze of the plans 
however  it is possible that we will be required to fund the plan assets of up to approximately  in for the plan year 
we will continue to evaluate the future funding requirements of the plans and fund them as deemed necessary 
see note for a more detailed discussion regarding our pension and other benefits plans 
income taxes the timing of cash payments for income taxes  which is governed by the internal revenue service and other taxing jurisdictions  will differ from the timing of recording tax expense and deferred income taxes  which are reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for example  tax laws in effect for regarding accelerated or bonus depreciation for tax reporting resulted in less cash payments than the gaap tax expense on continuing and discontinued operations 
acceleration of tax deductions could eventually result in situations where cash payments will exceed gaap tax expense 
changes in tax laws create uncertainty as to when or if this situation will occur within the next three years 
our deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and through the generation of future taxable income from ordinary and recurring operations 
deferred tax assets that are dependent on specific business segments generating future taxable income were determined to be more likely than not to be realized since those segments have at least years in which to generate 
table of contents the estimated required taxable income 
approximately  of future taxable income is estimated to be required to realize these deferred tax assets 
historically  pre tax earning for financial reporting purposes has exceeded the amount of taxable income reported for income tax purposes 
this has primarily occurred due to the acceleration of depreciation deductions for income tax reporting purposes 
regulatory matters as discussed more fully in the regulatory matters section above  the cpuc issued a final decision which will phase down our  current annual chcf interim draw by approximately  annually  over a year period ending on january  critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of our accounting policies 
our judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  because future events and the related effects can not be determined with certainty  actual results may differ from our estimates and assumptions and such differences could be material 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
goodwill as discussed more fully in note  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value below its carrying value 
the impairment test for goodwill requires us to estimate the fair value at the reporting unit level 
we have allocated our goodwill to the telephone reporting unit and the kansas city operations reporting unit 
the telecom segment includes the surewest telephone reporting unit 
the broadband segment includes the kansas city operations reporting unit 
we performed a valuation as of november  to determine the fair value of our goodwill primarily using a dcf model 
for the telephone reporting unit  assumptions used in the dcf model include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company s business plans  a weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted averaged cost of capital  and a terminal growth rate 
the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the telephone reporting unit was  as of december  when determining the fair value  the use of different estimates or assumptions within the dcf model could result in a different fair value 
for example  we used a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate of in our assessment of fair value in at november   the fair value was 
table of contents  and the associated carrying value was 
if the discount rate were to increase  the fair value of the telephone reporting unit would decrease by approximately  but would not result in an impairment of goodwill 
for the kansas city broadband reporting unit  other market capitalization and transaction based models were used along with a dcf model to identify any potential goodwill impairment 
assumptions used in the dcf model include the following cash flow assumptions regarding investment in network facilities  distribution channels and customer base the assumptions underlying these inputs are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments and the company s business plans  a weighted average cost of capital based on industry weighted averaged cost of capital  and a terminal growth rate 
the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to the kansas city operations reporting unit was  as of december  when determining the fair value  the use of different estimates or assumptions within the dcf model could result in a different fair value 
for example  we used a discount rate of and a terminal growth rate of in our assessment of fair value in at november  the fair value of the kansas city operating unit was  and the associated carrying value was  if the discount rate were to increase  the fair value would decrease by approximately  which would result in a potential impairment of goodwill 
revenue recognition as discussed more fully in note  total revenues from telephone services are affected by rates authorized by various regulatory agencies 
the fcc monitors surewest telephone s interstate earnings through its tariff review procedures and the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by surewest telephone 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the filing of tariffs and the preparation of the annual studies 
based on these rules  the company is required to prospectively set its interstate rates based on the aforementioned cost separation studies 
these cost studies include estimates and assumptions regarding various financial data including operating expenses  taxes and investment in property  plant and equipment 
non financial data estimates are also utilized in the preparation of these cost studies  including projected demand usage and detailed network information 
the company must also make estimates of the jurisdictional separation of this data to assign current financial and operating data to the interstate or intrastate jurisdiction 
these estimates are finalized in future periods as actual data becomes available to complete the separation studies 
the company also participates in the neca common line pool for certain interstate services and derives revenues from that pool 
as a result of estimates and assumptions  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of surewest telephone s interstate access revenues and shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material 
allowances for doubtful accounts as discussed more fully in note  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors including a specific customer s or carrier s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical and future expectations of conditions that may impact our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
if circumstances change or economic conditions worsen such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
if uncollectibility of our billed revenue changes by  we would expect an increase in uncollectible expense of approximately  as 
table of contents of december   we had three customers that accounted for approximately of our consolidated accounts receivable  net of allowances 
although management believes that these customers are creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material effect on their ability to pay timely and  therefore  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  certain revenues are subject to refund if the customer terminates services or returns equipment within a stipulated time period  or if certain performance criteria are not met 
accordingly  we maintain accounts receivable allowances and recognize certain customer refund liabilities  through charges to revenues  based on our best estimates of the resolution of these contingencies  which are based on historical experience 
income taxes as discussed more fully in notes and  we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
upon the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective january   we changed our methodology for estimating our potential liability for income tax positions for which uncertainty exists regardless of whether taxing authorities will challenge its interpretation of the income tax laws 
under fin no 
 we do not recognize any benefit in our financial statements for any uncertain income tax position if we believe the position in the aggregate has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
if we believe there is greater than likelihood that the position will be sustained  a benefit would be recognized in the financial statements equal to the largest amount that is believed more likely than not to be sustained upon an audit 
pension and other post retirement costs and obligations as discussed more fully in note  we have pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
our pension and post retirement benefit obligations are actuarially determined based on estimates of discount rates and long term rates of return on plan assets 
changes in these estimates and other factors could significantly impact our pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects percentage point increase percentage point decrease effect on total post retirement service and interest cost effect on post retirement benefit obligation as of january  for  the discount rates used for our pension and post retirement benefit obligations were and  respectively 
the discount rates were determined based on current yields on high quality corporate fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the benefit obligations 
the rate used for the post retirement benefit obligation reflects heavier weighting for retired participants of shorter durations 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost related to the pension plan would decrease pension income by and  respectively 
we did not make any contributions to the pension plan in or and do not expect to make any contributions during however  the downturn in the economy and financial markets in resulted in poor performance of our plan assets 
it may be possible that we will be required to make a contribution of up to approximately  to the plan assets in for the plan year 

table of contents equity incentive plans as disclosed more fully in notes and  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no

we adopted sfas no 
r  effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the amount of share based awards that is expected to be forfeited 
we calculate an estimated forfeiture rate based on historic forfeiture experience to date 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock was  and will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years

the fsp fas  clarifies how i management s internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present  ii observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account and iii the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value

regulatory and legal matters significant portions of surewest telephone s rates and charges are subject to regulation by the fcc and the cpuc 
rates and charges are based on various tariffs filed by surewest and others  including those filed by the neca for cl charges 
pending and future regulatory actions  with respect to these and other matters and the filing of new or amended tariffs  may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the emergence of a range of products and services that operate partially or entirely outside traditional regulatory frameworks but that compete with regulated service offerings has created new challenges for both us and the regulators 
our consolidated financial condition and results of operations have been and will be affected by recent and future proceedings before the cpuc and fcc 
pending before the fcc and cpuc are proceedings that  among other things  are considering additional rules governing the opening of markets to competition and the regulation of the competing telecommunications providers  the nature and extent of the compensation  if any  to be paid by carriers and other providers to one another for network use  and the sums to be recovered through end users and other sources  the goals and definition of universal telephone service in a changing environment  including examination of subsidy support mechanisms for subscribers of different carriers including incumbent carriers and in various geographic areas  rules that will provide non discriminatory access by competing service providers to the network capabilities of local exchange carriers  and the regulated rates and earnings of surewest telephone 
there are a number of pending and anticipated other regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on surewest telephone and also on subsidiaries in the broadband segment 
these regulatory proceedings also include newer issues  such as consideration of broadband deployment and regulation of ip enabled services 
the outcomes and impact of these proceedings and related court matters on the telecom segment  the broadband segment and the company as a whole cannot be determined at this time 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and credit risk 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
our exposure to market risk is primarily related to the impact of credit risk and interest rate fluctuations in our investment portfolio and debt obligations 
credit risk and interest rate risk in our cash equivalents and investments all of our cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments are carried at fair value 
cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality and accordingly  minimal credit risk exists 
our short term investments consist of corporate equity securities common stock  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our cash equivalents portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our investment income  operating results or liquidity 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio or for any other purposes 
at december   we held one  par value auction rate security ars with an estimated fair value of  this ars is collateralized by student loans that are guaranteed primarily by a monoline insurance company and partially by the federal family education loan program ffelp 
historically  the ars market was highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that reset the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every to days  to provide liquidity at par 
however  as a result of liquidity issues in the global credit and capital markets  the auctions for our ars failed beginning in february when sell orders exceeded buy orders 
we obtained a level valuation from an investment advisor  who utilized a discounted cash flow dcf approach to arrive at this valuation 
to support this valuation  we prepared a separate and comparable dcf model to estimate the fair value of the ars at december  the significant estimates that were used as inputs in our dcf model were the credit quality of the issuer and the monoline insurance company  the percentage and the types of guarantees such as the monoline insurance company and ffelp  interest rates  expected holding period of the ars  expected future cash flows  and an illiquidity discount factor 
this ars is compared  when possible  to other observable and relevant market data  which are non existent at this time 
the credit rating on the monoline insurance company is currently rated baa by the major rating agencies 
changes in the assumptions of the model based on dynamic market conditions could have a significant impact on the valuation of this security  which may lead us in the future to take an impairment charge for this security 
based on our review of the investment advisors valuation  our dcf model  the inputs to the model and the assessment of fair value as of december   we determined there was a decline in the fair value of the ars investment of  accordingly  the decline in fair value has been recorded as a charge to the statement of income 
if the discount rate used in the dcf model were to increase  the fair value of the ars would decrease by approximately if the expected holding period of the ars were to increase by years the fair value of the ars would decrease by approximately in november  we accepted an offer right from ubs financial services  inc  a subsidiary of ubs ag ubs  entitling us to sell at par value our ars originally purchased from ubs at anytime during a two year period from june  through july  in accepting the right  we granted ubs the authority to sell or auction the ars at par at any time up until the expiration date of the offer and released ubs from any claims relating to the marketing and sale of the ars 
although we expect to sell our ars under the right  if the right is not exercised before july  it will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
in lieu of our acceptance of the right  ars will continue to accrue and pay interest as determined by the auction process or the terms specified in the prospectus of the ars 
table of contents if the auction process fails 
we believe that subsequent changes in the value of the right will largely offset the subsequent fair value movements of the ars  subject to the continued expected performance by the financial institution of its obligations under the agreement 
ubs s obligations under the right are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
if ubs has insufficient funding to buy back the ars and the auction process continues to fail  then we may incur further losses on the carrying value of the ars 
interest rate risks in our debt obligations we enter into debt obligations to fund acquisitions  operations and planned capital expenditures 
at december   we had long term debt outstanding of  of this amount   or  bears interest at fixed rates with a weighted average rate of 
additionally  we had  of outstanding borrowings on our credit facility bearing interest at london interbank offered rate based rates with a weighted average rate of 
based on borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms and maturities  the estimated fair value of all of our long term debt as of december  was  we currently have no outstanding short term debt obligations as of december
