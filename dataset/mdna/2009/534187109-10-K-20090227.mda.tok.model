item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity and cash flow subsidiaries for a further discussion of our capital management in connection with xxx 

table of contents in light of the current downturn in the credit markets and the increased spreads on asset backed debt securities  we also cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impact of xxx or ag on future sales of term and ul insurance products 
if we are unable to continue to implement those actions  we may be required to increase statutory reserves  incur higher operating costs and lower returns on products sold than we currently anticipate or reduce our sales of these products 
we also may have to implement measures that may be disruptive to our business 
for example  because term and ul insurance are particularly price sensitive products  any increase in premiums charged on these products in order to compensate us for the increased statutory reserve requirements or higher costs of reinsurance may result in a significant loss of volume and adversely affect our life insurance operations 
a drop in the rankings of the mutual funds that we manage  as well as a loss of key portfolio managers  could result in lower advisory fees 
while mutual funds are not rated  per se  many industry periodicals and services  such as lipper  provide rankings of mutual fund performance 
these rankings often have an impact on the decisions of customers regarding which mutual funds to invest in 
if the rankings of the mutual funds for which we provide advisory services decrease materially  the funds assets may decrease as customers leave for funds with higher performance rankings 
similarly  a loss of our key portfolio managers who manage mutual fund investments could result in poorer fund performance  as well as customers leaving these mutual funds for new mutual funds managed by the portfolio managers 
any loss of fund assets would decrease the advisory fees that we earn from such mutual funds  which are generally tied to the amount of fund assets and performance 
this would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the financial accounting standards board 
it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses 
we are  and in the future may be  subject to legal actions in the ordinary course of our insurance and investment management operations  both domestically and internationally 
pending legal actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the businesses in which we operate 
some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants 
in certain of these matters  the plaintiffs are seeking large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive or exemplary damages 
substantial legal liability in these or future legal or regulatory actions could have a material financial effect or cause significant harm to our reputation  which in turn could materially harm our business prospects 
for more information on pending material legal proceedings  see regulatory and litigation matters in note for a description of our reportable litigation 
changes in us federal income tax law could increase our tax costs 
changes to the internal revenue code  administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our effective tax rate and lower our net income 
in this regard  on august   the internal revenue service irs issued a revenue ruling which purports  among other things  to modify the calculation of separate account deduction for dividends received by life insurance companies 
subsequently  the irs issued another revenue ruling that suspended the august   ruling and announced a new regulation project on the issue 
our income tax provision for the year ended december   included a separate account dividend received deduction benefit of million 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk  which could negatively affect our businesses or result in losses 
we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future 
nonetheless  our policies and procedures to identify  monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective 
many of our methods of managing risk and exposures are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models 
as a result  these methods may not predict future exposures  which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate  such as the risk of pandemics causing a large number of deaths 
other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets  clients  catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us  which may not always be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
management of operational  legal and regulatory risks requires  among other things  policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events  and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 

table of contents we face a risk of non collectibility of reinsurance  which could materially affect our results of operations 
we follow the insurance practice of reinsuring with other insurance and reinsurance companies a portion of the risks under the policies written by our insurance subsidiaries known as ceding 
as of december   we have ceded approximately billion of life insurance in force to reinsurers for reinsurance protection 
although reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their primary obligation to pay contract holders for losses insured under the policies we issue  reinsurance does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurance subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk 
as of december   we had billion of reinsurance receivables from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses  for which they are obligated to reimburse us under our reinsurance contracts 
of this amount  billion relates to the sale of our reinsurance business to swiss re in through an indemnity reinsurance agreement 
swiss re has funded a trust to support this business 
the balance in the trust changes as a result of ongoing reinsurance activity and was billion as of december  in addition  should swiss re s financial strength ratings drop below either s p aa or am best a  or their naic rbc ratio fall below  assets equal to the reserves supporting business reinsured must be placed into a trust according to pre established asset quality guidelines 
furthermore  approximately billion of the swiss re treaties are funds withheld structures where we have a right of offset on assets backing the reinsurance receivables 
included in the business sold to swiss re through indemnity reinsurance in was disability income business 
see further discussion of this business in reinsurance in the md a 
the balance of the reinsurance is due from a diverse group of reinsurers 
the collectibility of reinsurance is largely a function of the solvency of the individual reinsurers 
we perform annual credit reviews on our reinsurers  focusing on  among other things  financial capacity  stability  trends and commitment to the reinsurance business 
we also require assets in trust  letters of credit or other acceptable collateral to support balances due from reinsurers not authorized to transact business in the applicable jurisdictions 
despite these measures  a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance contract  especially swiss re  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
significant adverse mortality experience may result in the loss of  or higher prices for  reinsurance 
we reinsure a significant amount of the mortality risk on fully underwritten  newly issued  individual life insurance contracts 
we regularly review retention limits for continued appropriateness and they may be changed in the future 
if we were to experience adverse mortality or morbidity experience  a significant portion of that would be reimbursed by our reinsurers 
prolonged or severe adverse mortality or morbidity experience could result in increased reinsurance costs  and ultimately  reinsurers not willing to offer coverage 
if we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient  we would either have to be willing to accept an increase in our net exposures or revise our pricing to reflect higher reinsurance premiums 
if this were to occur  we may be exposed to reduced profitability and cash flow strain or we may not be able to price new business at competitive rates 
catastrophes may adversely impact liabilities for contract holder claims and the availability of reinsurance 
our insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality  such as a pandemic  an act of terrorism or other event that causes a large number of deaths or injuries 
significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century  but the likelihood  timing or severity of a future pandemic cannot be predicted 
in our group insurance operations  a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims 
these events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and  depending on their severity  could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
pandemics  hurricanes  earthquakes and man made catastrophes  including terrorism  may produce significant damage in larger areas  especially those that are heavily populated 
claims resulting from natural or man made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 
also  catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries 
accordingly  our ability to write new business could also be affected 
consistent with industry practice and accounting standards  we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event 
we cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established or applicable reinsurance will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities  and a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may be unable to attract and retain sales representatives and other employees and independent contractors  particularly financial advisors 
we compete to attract and retain financial advisors  wholesalers  portfolio managers and other employees and independent contractors  as well as independent distributors of our products 
intense competition exists for persons and independent distributors with demonstrated ability 
we compete with other financial institutions primarily on the basis of our products  compensation  support services and financial position 
sales in our businesses and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining financial advisors  wholesalers  portfolio managers and other employees  as well as independent distributors of our products 
our sales representatives are not captive and may sell products of our competitors 
we sell our annuity and life insurance products through independent sales representatives 
these representatives are not captive  which means they may also sell our competitors products 
if our competitors offer products that are more attractive than ours  or pay higher commission rates to the sales representatives than we do  these representatives may concentrate their efforts in selling our competitors products instead of ours 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property 
although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property 
we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our copyrights  trademarks  patents  trade secrets and know how or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability  which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful 
the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete 
we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon another party s intellectual property rights 
third parties may have  or may eventually be issued  patents that could be infringed by our products  methods  processes or services 
any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us 
we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright  trademark  trade secret or license usage rights 
any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages 
if we were found to have infringed a third party patent or other intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial liability  and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods  processes  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets or licenses  or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
intense competition could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability 
our businesses are intensely competitive 
we compete based on a number of factors  including name recognition  service  the quality of investment advice  investment performance  product features  price  perceived financial strength and claims paying and credit ratings 
our competitors include insurers  broker dealers  financial advisors  asset managers and other financial institutions 
a number of our business units face competitors that have greater market share  offer a broader range of products or have higher financial strength or credit ratings than we do 
in recent years  there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry resulting in increased competition from large  well capitalized financial services firms 
many of these firms also have been able to increase their distribution systems through mergers or contractual arrangements 
furthermore  larger competitors may have lower operating costs and an ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings  thereby allowing them to price their products more competitively 
we expect consolidation to continue and perhaps accelerate in the future  thereby increasing competitive pressure on us 

table of contents anti takeover provisions could delay  deter or prevent our change in control  even if the change in control would be beneficial to lnc shareholders 
we are an indiana corporation subject to indiana state law 
certain provisions of indiana law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
also  provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws and other agreements to which we are a party could delay  deter or prevent our change in control  even if a change in control would be beneficial to shareholders 
in addition  under indiana law  directors may  in considering the best interests of a corporation  consider the effects of any action on stockholders  employees  suppliers and customers of the corporation and the communities in which offices and other facilities are located  and other factors the directors consider pertinent 
one statutory provision prohibits  except under specified circumstances  lnc from engaging in any business combination with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock which shareholder  under the statute  would be considered an interested shareholder for a period of five years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder  unless such business combination is approved by the board of directors prior to such person becoming an interested shareholder 
in addition  our articles of incorporation contain a provision requiring holders of at least three fourths of our voting shares then outstanding and entitled to vote at an election of directors  voting together  to approve a transaction with an interested shareholder rather than the simple majority required under indiana law 
in addition to the anti takeover provisions of indiana law  there are other factors that may delay  deter or prevent our change in control 
as an insurance holding company  we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries are domiciled 
the insurance holding company acts and regulations restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company without prior regulatory approval 
under those statutes and regulations  without such approval or an exemption  no person may acquire any voting security of a domestic insurance company  or an insurance holding company which controls an insurance company  or merge with such a holding company  if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company or insurance company 
control is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls or more of the voting securities of another person 
similarly  as a result of its ownership of newton county loan savings  fsb  lnc is considered to be a savings and loan holding company 
federal banking laws generally provide that no person may acquire control of lnc  and gain indirect control of newton county loan savings  fsb  without prior regulatory approval 
generally  beneficial ownership of or more of the voting securities of lnc would be presumed to constitute control
