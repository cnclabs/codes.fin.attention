item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of ventas  inc together with its subsidiaries  unless otherwise indicated or except where the context otherwise requires  we  us or our 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis will help you understand our corporate and operating environment  highlights and other recent developments  our critical accounting policies and estimates  our results of operations for the last three years  asset and liability management  our liquidity and capital resources  our cash flows  and contractual obligations 
corporate and operating environment we are a real estate investment trust reit with a geographically diverse portfolio of seniors housing and healthcare properties in the united states and canada 
as of december   this portfolio consisted of assets seniors housing communities  skilled nursing facilities  hospitals and medical office buildings mobs and other properties in states and two canadian provinces 
with the exception of of our seniors housing communities that are managed by sunrise senior living  inc together with its subsidiaries  sunrise pursuant to long term management agreements and the majority of our mobs  we lease our properties to healthcare operating companies under triple net or absolute net leases  which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses 
we also had real estate loan investments relating to seniors housing and healthcare companies as of december  our primary business consists of acquiring  financing and owning seniors housing and healthcare properties and leasing those properties to third parties or operating those properties through independent third party managers 
we operate through two reportable business segments triple net leased properties and senior living operations 
as of december   we had a ownership interest in of our properties 
of the remaining properties  we had a to ownership interest in seniors housing communities  with the minority interest in those communities being owned by sunrise  and we had joint venture ownership interests in eight mobs  ranging from to 
our joint venture partners also typically provide management and leasing services for these mobs 
our business strategy is comprised of three principal objectives portfolio diversification  stable earnings and growth  and maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity 
while current conditions in the capital markets persist  maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity will be our primary focus 
access to external capital is an important component of the success of our strategy 
generally  we attempt to match the long term duration of most of our investments with long term fixed rate financing 
at december   only of our consolidated debt was variable rate debt 
we intend to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior debt securities and manage various capital ratios and amounts within appropriate parameters 
table of contents to the extent it is reasonable to do so 
as of december   we had credit ratings of bbb stable from standard poor s ratings services  bbb positive from fitch ratings and ba stable from moody s investors service on our senior unsecured debt securities 
access to capital markets impacts our ability to repay existing indebtedness as it matures and to make future investments 
our cost of and ability to access capital depend on various factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our securities  perception of our potential future earnings and cash distributions and the market price of our common stock 
highlights and other recent developments liquidity and balance sheet we amended and extended our unsecured revolving credit facility the us credit facility and entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility the canadian credit facility to expand our aggregate borrowing capacity to million and set the maturity date at april  under the canadian credit facility  we may borrow up to million or the equivalent in canadian dollars 
the us credit facility includes a million accordion feature that permits us to further expand our aggregate borrowing capacity to billion upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum based on us or canadian libor  the canadian bankers acceptance rate  or the us or canadian prime rate plus an applicable percentage based on our consolidated leverage 
the applicable percentage was at december  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in two underwritten public offerings pursuant to our existing universal shelf registration statement and received aggregate proceeds of million from the sales 
we purchased million principal amount of our senior notes due and million principal amount of our senior notes due in open market transactions and recorded a net gain on extinguishment of debt of million 
we benefited in from the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability in the amount of million 
we no longer expected to make any payments relating to that contingent liability and  therefore  the liability was removed from our consolidated balance sheet and included in our income for the year 
we raised million in ten year first mortgage financing on eight seniors housing communities 
our pro rata share of the proceeds was million 
investments we purchased million principal amount of first mortgage debt issued by a national provider of healthcare services  primarily skilled nursing care 
we purchased the debt at a discount for million  resulting in an effective interest rate to maturity of libor plus basis points 
interest on the loan is payable monthly at an annual rate of libor plus basis points  and the loan matures in  subject to a one year extension  at the borrower s option  subject to certain conditions 
we purchased a unit seniors housing community located in texas for million and leased it to an affiliate of capital senior living corporation 
we purchased three mobs for approximately million  increasing our total mob investments to over million square feet 
we own one of these mobs through a joint venture with a partner that provides management and leasing services for the property 

table of contents we entered into an agreement giving us the exclusive right  as part of a joint venture  to develop up to ten identified mobs on hospital campuses in eight states 
this joint venture is with a nationally recognized private developer of mobs and healthcare facilities 
as of december   we had initially invested approximately million in two mobs that were both under development 
these developments have million of committed construction loans 
we purchased million aggregate principal amount of three fixed rate and one variable rate unsecured corporate debt instruments issued by national healthcare companies  primarily at discounts for a total of million 
these debt investments mature between october and april  and the effective interest rate for each investment is approximately 
dispositions we sold seven healthcare assets in the second quarter for million and recognized a gain from the sale of million 
in the fourth quarter  we sold five seniors housing communities to the existing tenant for million 
we realized a gain from the sale of million  million of which was deferred and will be recognized over the next three years 
in january  we sold four seniors housing assets for million and expect to recognize a gain from the sale of approximately million in the first quarter of in february  we sold a hospital and a mob for million in an all cash transaction and expect to recognize a gain from the sale of million in the first quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires us to make estimates and judgments about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the related disclosures 
we base estimates on our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different  it is possible that different accounting treatment would have been applied  resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we re evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for more information regarding our critical accounting policies  please see note accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities over which we exercise control 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation  and net earnings are reduced by the portion of net earnings applicable to minority interests 
long lived assets and intangibles investments in real estate assets are recorded at cost 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method 
the cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible and recognized intangible assets and 
table of contents liabilities based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
we estimate fair values of the components of assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date 
recognized intangibles include the value of acquired lease contracts  management agreements and related customer relationships 
our method for allocating the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate requires us to make subjective assessments for determining fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired or assumed 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land and improvements  ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  above and or below market leases  other intangibles embedded in contracts and any debt assumed 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment  and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations  as amounts allocated to some assets and liabilities have different depreciation or amortization lives 
additionally  the amortization of value assigned to above and or below market leases is recorded as a component of revenue  as compared to the amortization of in place leases and other intangibles  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of income 
we estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis  and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset or internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio 
the fair value of in place leases  if any  reflects i above and or below market leases  if any  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals  the resulting intangible asset or liability of which is amortized to revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods  if applicable  ii the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants  including tenant allowances  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease  and iii an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period  as if the acquired space was vacant  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease 
we also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with the tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with the tenant 
we amortize such value over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases  which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
the fair value of long term debt is calculated by discounting the remaining contractual cash flows on each instrument at the current market rate for those borrowings 
discount rates are approximated based on the rate we estimate we would incur to replace each instrument on the date of acquisition 
any fair value adjustments related to long term debt are recognized as effective yield adjustments over the remaining term of the instrument 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows including sales proceeds is less than book value 
an impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such determination 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
marketable debt and equity securities we record marketable debt and equity securities as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are classified as a 
table of contents component of other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
these securities are recorded at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
interest income  including discount or premium amortization  on marketable debt securities and gains or losses on securities sold  which are based on the specific identification method  are reported in income from loans and investments on our consolidated statements of income 
loans receivable loans receivable are stated at the unpaid principal balance net of any deferred origination fees  purchase discounts or premiums and or valuation allowances 
net deferred origination fees are comprised of loan fees collected from the borrower net of certain direct costs 
net deferred origination fees and purchase discounts or premiums are amortized to income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method 
we evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors  including i corporate and facility level financial and operational reports  ii compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the loan or lease agreement  iii the financial stability of the borrower or tenant and any guarantor  iv the payment history of the borrower or tenant and v current economic conditions 
our level of reserves  if any  for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of these factors 
revenue recognition certain of our leases  excluding our master lease agreements with kindred healthcare  inc together with its subsidiaries  kindred the kindred master leases  but including the majority of our leases with brookdale senior living inc together with its subsidiaries  brookdale senior living  provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
income on our straight line revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the event we determine that collectibility of straight line revenue is not reasonably assured  we establish an allowance for estimated losses 
recognizing rental income on a straight line basis results in recognized revenue exceeding cash amounts contractually due from our tenants during the first half of the term for leases that have straight line treatment 
certain of our other leases  including the kindred master leases  provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other substantive contingencies are met  rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission the commission staff accounting bulletin i the agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
resident fees and services are recognized monthly as services are provided 
move in fees  which are a component of resident fees and services  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease agreement 
lease agreements with residents generally have a term of one year and are cancelable by the resident with days notice 
gain on sale of assets we recognize sales of assets only upon the closing of the transaction with the purchaser 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits and classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
gains on assets sold are recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sale price is reasonably assured  we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the 
table of contents sale to earn the profit  we have received adequate initial investment from the buyer  and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied 
gains may be deferred in whole or in part until the sales satisfy the requirements of gain recognition on sales of real estate under sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
federal income tax since we have elected to be treated as a reit under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  prior to our acquisition of the assets of sunrise senior living real estate investment trust sunrise reit in april we made no provision for federal income tax purposes  and we will continue to make no provision for reit income and expense 
as a result of the sunrise reit acquisition  we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities which are taxed as taxable reit subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the reit provisions 
we account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
an increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events  would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs 
deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset  would be included in the tax provision when the changes in circumstances and our judgment occurs 
recently adopted accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes when it is uncertain how an income or expense item should be treated on an income tax return 
fin describes when and in what amount an uncertain tax item should be recorded in the financial statements and provides guidance on recording interest and penalties and accounting and reporting for income taxes in interim periods 
we adopted fin on january  see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value and provides guidance for measuring fair value and the necessary disclosures 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements  sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs that are classified within levels one and two of the hierarchy and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level three of the hierarchy 
level one inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
level two inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in level one that are 
table of contents observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level two inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  other than quoted prices  such as interest rates  foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level three inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
in instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability

sfas no 
changes the reporting for minority interests  which must now be characterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of consolidated equity 
the calculation of income and earnings per share continues to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent and is characterized as net income from controlling interests 
as the ownership of a subsidiary increases or decreases  sfas no 
requires that any difference between the consideration paid and the adjustment to the noncontrolling interest balance be recorded as a component of equity in additional paid in capital  so long as we maintain a controlling ownership interest 
the adoption of sfas no 
also did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents apb specifies that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods

table of contents revenues related to our triple net leased properties segment are received directly from the tenant operator of the property based on the terms of the lease and are generally fixed amounts  with annual escalators subject to certain limitations 
therefore  while occupancy information is relevant to the operations of the tenant  our revenues and financial results are not directly impacted by the overall occupancy levels or profits at the triple net leased properties 
looking forward  some of our lease escalators are tied to annual increases in the consumer price index  which recently have trended negatively  and we are likely to see less growth in our rental income from these escalators as long as deflationary conditions continue 
the increase in resident fees and services during can be attributed primarily to the fact that we did not acquire the sunrise reit properties until late april see note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k

table of contents historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values  instead  have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit  and we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of our business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of our ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk market risks relating to our financial instruments result primarily from changes in us or canadian libor rates  the canadian bankers acceptance rate or the us or canadian prime rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities  certain of our mortgage loans that are floating rate obligations and mortgage loans receivable 
while interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our fixed rate debt obligations unless such instruments mature  or until such time that we would be required to refinance such debt  they will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments 
if interest rates have risen at the time our fixed rate debt matures  or at such time we would be required to refinance such debt  our profitability could be adversely affected by the additional cost of borrowings 
conversely  lower interest rates at the time our debt matures or at the time of refinancing may lower our overall borrowing costs 
we continuously monitor our level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 

table of contents to highlight the sensitivity of our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and as of december  in thousands gross book value fair value fair value reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due primarily to debt repayments and overall changes in interest rates 
the table below sets forth certain information with respect to our debt  excluding premiums and discounts dollars in thousands as of december  balance fixed rate variable rate total percent of total debt fixed rate variable rate total weighted average interest rate at end of period fixed rate variable rate total weighted average rate the increase in our outstanding variable rate debt from december  is primarily attributable to additional net borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and additional borrowings related to acquisitions 
pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants  if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling million as of december   our tenant is required to pay us additional rent on a dollar for dollar basis in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates 
therefore  the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant 
assuming a one percentage point increase in the interest rate related to the variable rate debt  and assuming no change in the outstanding balance as of december   interest expense for inclusive of the million would increase and our net income would decrease by approximately million  or per common share on a diluted basis 
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which we could obtain similar borrowings 
in the past  we mitigated some interest rate risk through an interest rate swap agreement designed to hedge against rising interest rates 
however  the swap expired on june   and we do not currently have any interest rate swap agreements in effect  nor do we expect to enter into any additional interest rate swap agreements at this time 
we may  however  engage in hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate environments and the costs and risks of such strategies 
we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents we are subject to fluctuations in us and canadian exchange rates which may  from time to time  have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar will impact the amount of net income we earn from our canadian operations 
based on results  if the canadian exchange rate were to increase or decrease by  our net income would decrease or increase  as applicable  by approximately million per year 
if we increase our international presence through investments in  and or acquisitions or development of  seniors housing and or healthcare assets outside the united states  we may also decide to transact additional business in currencies other than us or canadian dollars 
although we may decide to pursue hedging alternatives including additional borrowings in local currencies to protect against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot assure you that any such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity  on our ability to service our indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders  as required for us to continue to qualify as a reit a material adverse effect 
we also have investments in marketable debt securities where we earn interest on a fixed and floating rate basis 
these investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
interest rate fluctuations and market conditions will cause the fair market value of these investments to change 
as of december   the fair market value of our marketable debt securities was million  with an original cost of million 
during  we purchased million principal amount of first mortgage debt issued by a national provider of healthcare services  primarily skilled nursing care 
we purchased the debt at a discount for million  resulting in an effective interest rate to maturity of libor plus basis points 
interest on the loan is payable monthly at an annual rate of libor plus basis points  and the loan matures in january  subject to a one year extension  at the borrower s option  subject to certain conditions 
as of december   we held a receivable for three outstanding first mortgage loans the sunwest loans in the aggregate principal amount of million 
during  we recorded a provision for loan losses on the sunwest loans of million as a result of certain defaults by the borrower 
as of december   the fair value of our loans receivable was million and was based on our estimates of currently prevailing rates for comparable loans 
see note loans receivable and note fair value of financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
credit risk we receive a significant portion of our revenue by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
some of our triple net lease escalators are tied to the consumer price index  with caps  floors or collars 
we also earn revenue from residents and tenants at our operating assets 
historically  most of our revenue and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization were derived from assets subject to long term triple net leases 
currently  of our ebitda is derived from non triple net leases our senior living operations and mobs where rental rates may fluctuate upon lease rollovers and renewals due to economic or market conditions 
for the years ended december  and  kindred accounted for million  or  of our total revenues and of our total noi net operating income including amounts in discontinued operations  and million  or  of our total revenues and of our total noi including amounts in discontinued operations  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  brookdale senior living accounted for million  or  of our total revenues and of our total noi including amounts in discontinued operations  and million  or  of our total revenues and of our total noi including amounts in discontinued operations  respectively

as a result  kindred s and brookdale senior living s financial condition and ability to meet their rental payments and other obligations to us has a significant impact on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities  which could also affect its ability to pay rent to us

we regularly monitor the credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by  among other things  i reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally  publicly available information regarding tenants  and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements  and ii having periodic discussions with tenants  borrowers and their representatives 
approximately of our ebitda and of our total revenues including amounts in discontinued operations for the year ended december  were attributable to senior living operations managed by sunrise 
approximately of our total revenues including amounts in discontinued operations for the year ended december  were attributable to senior living operations managed by sunrise for the period from april  the date of the sunrise reit acquisition through december  we are party to management agreements with sunrise pursuant to which sunrise currently provides comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to of our seniors housing communities 
each management agreement has a term of years from its effective date  the earliest of which began in pursuant to the management agreements  we pay sunrise a base management fee of of resident fees and similar revenues  subject to reduction based on below target performance relating to noi for a pool of properties 
the minimum management fee assessable under these agreements is of resident fees and similar revenues of the properties 
we also pay incentive fees if a pool of properties exceeds aggregate performance targets relating to noi  provided  however  that total management fees  including incentive fees  shall not exceed of resident fees and similar revenues 
in  we paid a management fee for properties and management fees of between and for eight properties 
the management agreements also specify that we or the joint venture to which we are party  as applicable will reimburse sunrise for direct or indirect costs necessary to manage our seniors housing communities 
we may terminate our management agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default by sunrise in the performance of a material covenant or term thereof including the revocation of any licenses or certificates necessary for operation  subject in each case to sunrise s rights to cure deficiencies 
each management agreement may also be terminated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events relating to sunrise 
in addition  if a minimum number of properties fail to achieve a targeted noi level for a given period  then we may terminate the management agreement on each property in such pool 
this targeted noi level for each property is based upon an expected operating income projection set at the commencement of the management agreement for the applicable property  with such projection escalating annually 
however  various legal and contractual considerations may limit or delay our exercise of any or all of these termination rights 
we own a to ownership interest in of our seniors housing communities pursuant to joint venture agreements  with the minority interests in these joint ventures being owned by sunrise 
these joint ventures are each managed by a board of managers  which we control

table of contents additional interests in the joint venture  c the dissolution of the joint venture  d the disposition of a senior housing community owned by the joint venture  and e the acquisition of any real property 
we can generally transfer our interest in a sunrise joint venture  without consent  to anyone other than large seniors housing operators or their majority investors 
generally  sunrise must obtain our prior consent for any direct or indirect transfer of its interest in a joint venture 
with limited exceptions  profits and losses of the joint venture are allocated pro rata to each member 
if either member fails to make a required capital contribution to a joint venture after notice and a cure period  the non defaulting member may i revoke the capital contribution funding notice  ii advance to the joint venture the amount of the required capital contribution on behalf of the defaulting member in the form of a loan to the defaulting member  with all of the defaulting member s subsequent distributions being applied to the loan until repayment in full  or iii advance the capital on behalf of the defaulting member with a recalculation of each member s proportionate interest in the joint venture pursuant to the applicable formula in the agreements 
many of our sunrise joint venture agreements provide for a punitive reduction in the defaulting member s proportionate interest in the event of an advance of capital by a non defaulting member pursuant to option iii 
the joint ventures are generally limited to incurring new or refinanced mortgage indebtedness in excess of of the market value of its properties
