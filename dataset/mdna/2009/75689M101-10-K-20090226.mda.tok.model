item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our discussions for the fiscal years ending december  and december  refer to a week period 
our discussion for the fiscal year ending december  refers to a week period with the fifty third week falling in the fourth quarter 
as of december   we owned and operated  or franchised red robin restaurants in states and canada  of which were company owned and were operated under franchise agreements including one franchise owned restaurant managed by the company under a management agreement 
in fiscal  we plan to open to new company owned red robin restaurants and we believe our franchisees will open between seven to eight new restaurants 
as of february   we have opened four company owned restaurants and our franchisees have opened two restaurant 
our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants 
the challenging macro economic environment continued during fiscal with spikes in fuel costs  increased food commodity costs  and the failure of several investment and commercial banking institutions 
credit markets have contracted as lending institutions have tightened lending policies and equity markets have experienced extreme volatility and downward price movements 
increasing lack of consumer confidence and pressures on guests discretionary income continue to produce declining restaurant revenue across the industry 
in fiscal  we experienced a decline in guest counts and a decline in average weekly comparable restaurant sales volumes from the prior year 
despite these external pressures  we were able to grow restaurant sales in from the development of new company owned restaurants and the acquisition of existing franchised owned restaurants 
in addition to pressures on our guests spending  the restaurant industry has faced increased costs for food  labor and supplies 
in  we focused on cost reductions to mitigate increasing commodity and labor costs 
however  while successful in managing many of these costs  we were unable to completely offset the decline in our profitability from those cost reduction initiatives 
while we expect the uncertainties in the economy will continue to impact the restaurant industry in  we believe the long term growth and profit opportunities remain strong for red robin 

table of contents the following summarizes the operational and financial highlights during fiscal and outlook new restaurant openings 
we opened new company owned restaurants during fiscal while our new restaurants have been impacted by the decline in guest visits  our initiatives to reduce costs  both pre and post opening  and to normalize operations faster have been successful 
in the near term  we are taking a balanced approach to our development as we seek to deploy our capital conservatively while maintaining restaurant growth 
we plan on opening to new company owned restaurants in we believe we will fund all restaurant development from our operating cash flow 
comparable restaurant sales 
for the fifty two weeks ended december   the restaurants in our current comparable base experienced a decrease in sales from these same restaurants last year 
this decrease was driven by a decrease in guest counts partially offset by a increase in the average guest check 
our restaurant revenues are significantly affected by changes in discretionary spending patterns  economic conditions  and cost fluctuations 
many of our guests are impacted by the current macroeconomic pressures and they have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
accordingly  we continuously strive to maintain and enhance the strength of our brand and to deliver memorable dining experiences that attract new guests and retain our already loyal guest 
because of declines in guest traffic combined with our decision to eliminate cable television advertising  we expect comparative restaurant sales to decline in however  we cannot project  with confidence  the impact reduced guest spending and less advertising will have on our restaurant sales 
franchise acquisitions 
we completed the purchase of existing franchise restaurants and one restaurant that had been under construction for approximately million  net of a  charge related to the purchase of the restaurants 
in addition to the acquisition of these restaurants  we gained access to development rights where these restaurants are located territories that were formerly subject to exclusivity provisions of the former area development agreements 
the combined revenue from the existing restaurants was approximately million in the last full year before we purchased the restaurants 
in  these acquisitions added million of revenue to our total restaurant revenues 
the financial results of all restaurants have been included in our financial results from their acquisition dates forward 
food costs 
the costs of many basic foods  including corn  wheat  soy beans and oil increased in this has resulted in upward pricing pressures on almost all of our food costs categories including beef  dairy  steak fries and fry oil  and we expect that pressure to continue through we implemented price increases during fiscal which have helped to offset some of these increased costs 
in addition  we mitigated the rising price increases for some of our commodities through favorable fixed pricing contracts in in  we believe our two largest cost pressures are for ground beef used in our hamburgers and potatoes that are used to make our steak fries 
in  we had favorable fixed pricing for ground beef 
in  we expect an increase in ground beef prices above our contract  as we have locked of our ground beef volumes through june and approximately of our ground beef volumes above last year s contract price for the second half of the cost of our steak fries will increase in as many farmers planted higher profit crops during the planting season and  in turn  reduced the potato crops planted 
we expect that we will have less ability to implement price increases to offset increased costs for the foreseeable future given the current pressures on our guests discretionary income and the competitive landscape 

table of contents labor 
labor costs as a percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal by primarily due to the price increases and operational initiatives we have put into practice to focus on improved productivity of our controllable labor 
these initiatives as well as our price increases helped offset minimum wage cost increases we experienced in minimum wage increases in will put further pressure on our restaurant level profitability 
in addition  lower comparable restaurant revenue will put additional deleverage pressure on our fixed labor costs 
national media advertising campaign 
in  we expanded our national media advertising campaign that was started in by launching the campaign in february as compared to april  and by airing more than double the number of weeks on air in compared to this advertising campaign was funded by both company owned and franchised restaurants that in contributed of their sales to a national advertising fund  which was up from in we believe the national media campaign helped to build brand awareness and brand equity in both new and existing markets 
given the increased difficulty in measuring the effectiveness of national cable advertising in an environment where consumers are pulling back on retail and restaurant spending and our desire to reduce costs in this challenging environment  we will not run national cable advertising in this will result in reduced spending equal to approximately of restaurant revenue in in  our marketing strategy will be focused on expanding our national on line and digital media advertising efforts as well as introducing a targeted direct mail campaign to support product specific news

acquired restaurants refers to franchised red robin restaurants we acquired during restaurant revenue  which is comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  increased by million  or  from fiscal the significant factors contributing to our increase in restaurant revenue were restaurant openings and acquisitions 
fiscal restaurant sales for restaurants not in the comparable base contributed an increase of million  of which million was attributable to restaurants opened during fiscal a portion of the restaurant sales for the acquired restaurants contributed million of the increase in restaurant revenue for the fifty two weeks ended december  restaurants sales in the comparable base experienced a sales decrease of approximately million during fiscal the revenue growth in over was attributable to revenue from the acquired restaurants  the acquired restaurants and a increase in comparable restaurant revenues from this increase in restaurant revenue was partially offset by decreased revenue from our non comparable restaurants opened during and the increase in comparable restaurant revenues in was driven by a increase in the average check partially offset by a decrease in guest counts

occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue for were comparable to as higher fixed rents and higher real estate and property taxes were offset by decreases for general insurance 
depreciation and amortization in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of acquired franchise rights and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues increased in due primarily to increased depreciation and amortization expense related to new and acquired restaurants and lower average restaurant sales volumes

general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues for decreased as a percentage of total revenues due to lower performance based bonus accruals in and lower spending for consulting and professional fees 
these decreases were partially offset by the impact of lower restaurant sales volumes on primarily fixed costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase during due primarily to expected performance based bonus accruals 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue remained flat compared to primarily due to decreased non advertising related marketing expenses and leverage from fixed costs such as salaries and compensation expense offset by increased professional and consulting fees

pre opening costs for  and reflect the opening of  and new restaurants  respectively 
average per restaurant pre opening costs 
table of contents represent total costs incurred for those restaurants that opened for business during the periods presented 
the average per restaurant pre opening costs decreased over prior year due primarily to lower travel and labor costs for our new restaurant openings which offset higher pre opening occupancy expenses 
we expect that pre opening costs per restaurant in will be approximately  as we plan to open to new restaurants 
the increases in our average pre opening costs per restaurant over reflects higher training expenses for our new training programs 
these training programs were designed to accelerate the development of proficiencies of each hourly team member to improve productivity and normalize operations of our new restaurants sooner than what we had experienced in the performance of restaurants opened prior to asset impairment charge in we recognized a total of million of asset impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized non cash asset impairment charges of million related to the write down of the carrying value of a portion of long lived assets associated with four restaurants we plan to close during the first quarter of this decision  which was reached during the fourth quarter of  was the result of an initiative to identify those restaurants  new or aged  that were in declining trade areas  performing under our minimum profitability levels and or required significant capital expenditures 
the locations selected for closure represent older restaurants whose leases were not extended or which were in need of significant capital improvement that are operating with lower profitability and are not projected to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future 
we also anticipate additional charges of up to  will be recognized during the first quarter of related to lease terminations and other closing related costs for these four restaurants 
in addition to impairment charges related to the planned restaurant closures  we recognized million of non cash impairment charges in the third quarter of for two restaurants that we expect to continue operations 
reacquired franchise costs as a result of the acquisition of the restaurants during the second quarter  we incurred a total charge of  which is primarily related to avoided franchise fees  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for preexisting relationships between the parties to a business combination eitf

liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this decrease was due primarily to million used for construction of new restaurants and expenditures for facility improvements  million used for the buy back of approximately million shares of our common stock  as well as million used for the acquisition of the red robin franchised restaurants and one restaurant that had been under construction during the second quarter these uses of cash were partially offset by million of cash provided by operating activities and additional net borrowings under our credit agreement 
we expect to continue to reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants  repurchase options in the tender offer  pay down debt and leave the potential to opportunistically repurchase some of our common stock 
credit facility 
our existing credit facility permits us to have a more flexible capital structure and facilitates our growth plans 
the credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on june   and ii a million term loan maturing on june   both with rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus currently 
the credit agreement also allows us  subject to lender participation which is at their sole discretion  to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional million in the future 
as part of the credit agreement  we may also request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based upon the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by first priority liens and security interests in the capital stock of subsidiaries of the company 
additionally  the credit agreement includes a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
our credit facility is with a consortium of banks that include wachovia bank na  wells fargo bank na  bank of america na  keybank na and suntrust bank na among others 
we do not believe the recent purchase of wachovia bank na by wells fargo bank na will limit our ability to borrow under our credit facility or that any of our lenders will not be able to fulfill their lending commitments under our credit facility 
with regard to the term loan facility  we are required to repay the principal amount of the term loan in consecutive quarterly installments which began september  and will end on the maturity date of the term loan 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under 
table of contents our term loan  million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
loan origination costs associated with the credit facility and the net outstanding balance of costs related to the original and subsequent amendment to the credit facility are million and are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition to the required repayments on the term loan  we expect to utilize excess cash flow to reduce our debt during covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various credit agreements  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  and dividend payments 
in addition  we are required to maintain two financial ratios a leverage ratio calculated as our debt outstanding including issued standby letters of credit divided by the last twelve months earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebita adjusted for certain non cash charges  and a fixed charge ratio calculated as our consolidated cash flow divided by our consolidated debt service obligations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance through fiscal debt outstanding 
total debt outstanding increased to million at december  from million at december   due to additional borrowings to construct new restaurants  finance our franchise acquisition  repurchase outstanding common stock  and acquire other assets  offset by scheduled debt repayments and payments made on capital lease obligations 
during the third quarter  we paid off our outstanding collateralized notes payable balance of million with funds provided through the term loan facility

capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
fiscal  compared with fiscal  includes higher expenditures for new restaurants as well as increases in facility improvements 
the increase in cash flows utilized in compared with was primarily due to expenditures for new restaurant construction and remodeling 
on may   we completed our acquisitions of existing red robin franchised restaurants and one that had been under construction  from three franchisees for a combined purchase price of million 
the purchase price was paid in cash  funded primarily through borrowings under our existing credit facility 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
in addition to the construction of to new restaurants  we will continue our investment in restaurant remodels and capital improvements 
stock repurchase 
during the second quarter  we purchased a total of  shares of our common stock for approximately million with an average purchase price of per share 
the funding for the repurchase was provided by borrowings under our credit facility 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to million of the company s equity securities of which repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions and through privately negotiated transactions through december  option tender offer 
on january   we commenced a cash tender offer for out of the money stock options held by approximately current employees 
approximately million stock options were tendered by team members 
the gross proceeds of million were paid on february  the stock options eligible for tender must have been granted prior to december  with an exercise price at or above per share 
pursuant to the terms of the tender offer  eligible employees that elected to participate were required to tender all of their eligible options 
as a result of the tender offer  the company expects it will incur a one time non cash charge of approximately million for all unvested eligible options which were tendered 
this charge will be reflected in the fiscal first quarter of financial results and represents the compensation expense related to the acceleration of vesting on the unvested options tendered in the offer  which would have otherwise been expensed over their vesting period in the future if they had not been tendered 
financial condition and future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  support for infrastructure needs  and for general operating purposes 
in addition  we have and may continue to use capital to acquire franchise restaurants or repurchase our common stock 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company and the restaurant industry in general maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors generally grant trade credit for purchases  such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new restaurants and refurbishment of existing restaurants  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 

table of contents inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor costs  energy costs  and materials used in the construction of new restaurants 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage have directly affected our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation had a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in fiscal year  due primarily to increased labor costs  higher energy costs  higher costs for certain supplies and petroleum based products  and commodity prices for certain foods we purchased at market rates 
uncertainties related to fluctuations in costs  including energy costs  commodity prices  annual indexed wage increases and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have on our business during seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and other factors 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgment 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies is disclosed in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense 
under the fair value recognition provisions of the sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model and recognize expense on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of an option 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective and judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is recorded at cost 
expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life for owned assets and the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the underlying lease for leased assets 
changes in circumstances  such as changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy  can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where management determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation and amortization expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or closing of facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include judgments by management regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets  the expected lease term for assets related to properties under lease and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or 
table of contents increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact management s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets and amortized intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are generally measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  including assumptions on future revenue trends 
management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
during  we recorded million of impairments of certain long lived restaurants for two restaurants expected to close in the first quarter of and for two restaurants expected to continue operations 
we may record future impairments for restaurants whose operating performance falls below current expectations 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets including goodwill balances to the fair value of our net assets using the quoted market price of our common stock and is performed at our fiscal year end in december 
we completed our most recent goodwill impairment test in december and determined that our estimated market capitalization as of december  fell below our carrying value 
this indicated a possible impairment under sfas we have performed an additional impairment assessment and have determined that there is no goodwill impairment at the end of fiscal these assessments include our best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projection period including growth rates in sales  costs and number of units  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
the company will continue to monitor its stock price and may perform additional analyses during if the stock price does not recover sufficiently 
at december   goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
lease accounting 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which generally coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 

table of contents judgments made by management for its lease obligations include the probable term for each lease that affects the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for a portion of losses related to group health insurance  general liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial based estimates  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
in addition  our history of self insured experience is short and our significant rate of growth could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or should medical costs increase beyond what was expected  our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes in our estimates may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported historically under these programs 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases primarily restaurant leases entered into the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

specifically  fsp clarifies how management s internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present  observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account  and the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value 
fsp is effective and applies to prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued for interim or annual periods ending on or before december  the implementation of fsp did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets  fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this change is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r and other gaap 
the requirement for determining useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  which will require us to adopt these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact fsp on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our credit agreement  amended in june  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an alternate base rate abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or a libor  based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to 
the spread  or margin  for abr and libor loans under the credit agreement is subject to quarterly adjustment based on our then current leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement 
as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates  and a plus or minus change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuation of  on an annualized basis 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we use an interest rate swap and may use caps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
as appropriate  on the date derivative contracts are entered into  we designate derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
during march  the company entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with suntrust bank  national association suntrust to mitigate our floating interest rate on an aggregate of up to million of our debt that is currently or expected to be outstanding under our amended and restated credit facility 
the interest rate swap has an effective date of march  
table of contents and a termination date of march  for million of the initial million and march  for the remaining million 
the agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge under which we are required to make payments based on a fixed interest rate of calculated on an initial notional amount of million  in exchange we will receive interest on a million of notional amount at a variable rate 
the variable rate interest we receive is based on the month libor rate 
this hedge is highly effective as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and there were no gains or losses recognized in earnings during as of december   the million unrealized loss  net of taxes  on cash flow hedging instrument is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
primarily all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to significant foreign currency risk 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price product purchase commitments which may exclude fuel surcharges and other fees 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
