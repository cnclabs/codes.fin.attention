item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect management s current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially form those anticipated in these forward looking statements or as a result of certain factors such as those set forth below under forward looking statements 
overview we are a delaware corporation formed in to serve as the parent holding company for an oilfield services business operating under the superior well services name since we service our customers in key markets in many of the active domestic oil and natural gas producing regions in the appalachian  mid continent  rocky mountain  southwest and southeast regions of the united states 
in august  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share and in december we completed a follow on offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we provide a wide range of wellsite solutions to oil and natural gas companies  primarily technical pumping services and down hole surveying services 
we focus on offering technologically advanced equipment and services at competitive prices  which we believe allows us to successfully compete against both major oilfield services companies and smaller  independent service providers 
in november  we purchased the pressure pumping  fluid logistics and completion  production and rental tools business lines from diamondback for approximately million 
the acquisition consideration consisted of million in cash  million of our series a convertible preferred stock million liquidation preference series a preferred stock and million in second lien notes aggregating million plus million of transaction costs for a total purchase price of million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired  horsepower  transports and trucks  frac tanks and six water disposal wells 
the assets that we purchased from diamondback are operating in the anadarko  arkoma  and permian basins  as well as the barnett shale  woodford shale  west texas  southern louisiana and texas gulf coast 
services offered our services are conducted through two principal business segments which are technical services and fluid logistics 
each business segment includes service lines that contain similarities among customers  financial performance and management  as well as the economic and business conditions impacting their activity levels 
technical services include technical pumping  down hole surveying and completion  production and rental tool services 
fluid logistics services include those services related to the transportation  storage and disposal of fluids that are used in the drilling  development and production of hydrocarbons 
substantially all of our customers are domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production companies that typically require all types of services in their operations 
our operating revenue from these operations  and their relative percentages of our total revenue  consisted of the following dollars in thousands year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue technical services fluid logistics total revenue 
table of contents the following is a brief description of our services technical services technical pumping services we offer three types of technical pumping services stimulation  nitrogen and cementing services  which accounted for  and of our revenue for the year ended december  and  and of our revenue for the year ended december   respectively 
our fluid based stimulation services include fracturing and acidizing  which are designed to improve the flow of oil and natural gas from producing zones 
in addition to our fluid based stimulation services  we also use nitrogen to stimulate wellbores 
our foam based nitrogen stimulation services accounted for substantially all of our total nitrogen services revenue in and our cementing services consist of blending high grade cement and water with various additives to create a cement slurry that is pumped through the well casing into the void between the casing and the bore hole 
once the slurry hardens  the cement isolates fluids and gases  which protects the casing from corrosion  holds the well casing in place and controls the well 
completion  production and rental tool services completion and production services were added in connection with the diamondback asset acquisition and accounted for or our revenues for the year ended december  our completion and production services and other production related activities include specialty services  many of which are performed after drilling has been completed 
consequently  these services occur later in the lifecycle while a well is being completed or during the production stage 
these specialty services include plugging and abandonment and roustabout services  as well as the sale and rental of equipment 
these services require skilled personnel and various types and sizes of equipment 
as newly drilled oil and natural gas wells are prepared for production  our completion services include selectively testing producing zones of the wells before and after stimulation 
down hole surveying services we offer two types of down hole surveying services logging and perforating which collectively accounted for approximately and of our revenues for years ended december  and  respectively 
our logging services involve the gathering of down hole information through the use of specialized tools that are lowered into a wellbore from a truck 
an armored electro mechanical cable  or wireline  is used to transmit data to our surface computer that records various characteristics about the formation or zone to be produced 
we provide perforating services as the initial step of stimulation by lowering specialized tools and perforating guns into a wellbore by wireline 
the specialized tools transmit data to our surface computer to verify the integrity of the cement and position the perforating gun  which fires shaped explosive charges to penetrate the producing zone to create a short path between the oil or natural gas reservoir and the production tubing to enable the production of hydrocarbons 
in addition  we also perform workover services aimed at improving the production rate of existing oil and natural gas wells  including perforating new hydrocarbon bearing zones in a well once a deeper zone or formation has been depleted 
fluid logistics services oil and natural gas operations use and produce significant quantities of fluids 
we provide a variety of services to assist our customers to obtain  transport  store and dispose of fluids that are involved in the drilling  development and production of hydrocarbons 
we own or lease over fluid hauling transports and trucks  which are used to transport various fluids in the lifecycle of an oil or natural gas well 
as of december   we also owned approximately frac tanks which are rented to producers for use in fracturing and stimulation operations plus other fluid storage needs 
we use our fleet of fluid hauling trucks to fill and empty the frac tanks and we deliver and remove these tanks from the well sites 
as of december   we owned and operated six water disposal wells in texas and oklahoma 
the disposal wells are an important component of fluid logistic operations as they provide an efficient solution for the disposal of waste waters 
fluid logistics accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  
table of contents how we generate our revenue the majority of our customers are regional  independent oil and natural gas companies 
the primary factor influencing demand for our services by those customers is their level of drilling activity  which  in turn  depends primarily on current and anticipated future natural gas and crude oil commodity prices and production depletion rates 
we generate revenue from our technical pumping services  down hole surveying and completion  production and rental tool services by charging our customers a set up charge plus an hourly rate based on the type of equipment used 
the set up charges and hourly rates are determined by a competitive bid process and depend upon the type of service to be performed  the equipment and personnel required for the particular job and the market conditions in the region in which the service is performed 
each job is given a base time allotment of six hours 
we generally charge an increased hourly rate for each hour worked beyond the initial six hour base time allotment 
we also charge customers for the materials  such as stimulation fluids  cement and nitrogen  that we use in each job 
material charges include the cost of the materials plus a markup and are based on the actual quantity of materials used 
we generate revenue from our fluid logistics services by charging our customers based on volumes transported  quantities of fluids disposed and rental charges for use of our frac tanks 
the rates for the transportation of fluids are generally determined by a competitive bid process and depend upon the type of service to be performed  the equipment and personnel and the cost of goods required for the particular job and the market conditions in the region in which the service is performed 
the rates for our fluid disposal services vary depending on the type of fluid being disposed and the rates charged are generally driven by market conditions in the region the disposal well is located 
frac tank rental are rented on a daily basis and the rates are generally driven by market conditions in the region the disposal well is located 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze the performance of our services 
these measurements include the following operating income per operating region  material and labor expenses as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  and ebitda 
operating income per operating region 
we currently service customers in five operating regions through our service centers 
our appalachian region service centers are located in bradford  black lick and mercer  pennsylvania  wooster  ohio  kimball  buckhannon and jane lew  west virginia  norton  virginia  and gaylord  michigan 
our southeast region service centers are located in cottondale  alabama  columbia  mississippi  and bossier city and broussard  louisiana 
our mid continent region service centers are located in hominy  enid  clinton  cleveland  marlow  countyline  sweetwater  coalgate  and elk city  oklahoma  hays  kansas  and van buren  arkansas 
our rocky mountain region service centers are located in vernal  utah  farmington  new mexico  rock springs  wyoming  williston  north dakota  and trinidad and brighton  colorado 
our southwest region service centers are located in alvarado  cresson  tolar  midland and victoria  texas  and artesia  new mexico 
the operating income generated in each of our operating regions is an important part of our operational analysis 
we monitor operating income separately for each of our operating regions and analyze trends to determine our relative performance in each region 
our analysis enables us to more efficiently allocate our equipment and field personnel among our various operating regions and determine if we need to increase our marketing efforts in a particular region 
by comparing our operating income on an operating region basis  we can quickly identify market increases or decreases in the diverse geographic areas in which we operate 
it has been our experience that when we establish a new service center in a particular operating region  it may take from to months before that service center has a positive impact on the operating income that we generate in the relevant region 

table of contents material and labor expenses as a percentage of revenue 
material and labor expenses are composed primarily of cost of materials  maintenance  fuel and the wages of our field personnel 
the cost of these expenses as a percentage of revenue has historically remained relatively stable for our established service centers 
our material costs primarily include the cost of inventory consumed while performing our stimulation  nitrogen and cementing services 
increases in our material and fuel costs are frequently passed on to our customers 
however  due to the timing of our marketing and bidding cycles  there is generally a delay of several weeks or months from the time that we incur an actual price increase until the time that we can pass on that increase to our customers 
our labor costs consist primarily of wages for our field personnel 
as a result of on going shortages of qualified supervision personnel and equipment operators in certain areas in which we operate  it is possible that we will have to raise wage rates to attract and train workers from other fields in order to maintain or expand our current work force 
historically  we have been able to increase service rates to our customers to compensate for wage rate increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a expenses  include administrative  marketing and maintenance employee compensation and related benefits  office and lease expenses  insurance costs and professional fees  as well as other costs and expenses not directly related to field operations 
our management continually evaluates the level of our general and administrative expenses in relation to our revenue because these expenses have a direct impact on our profitability 
our aggregate selling  general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of the growth in operations  as well as a result of our becoming a public company 
ebitda 
we define ebitda as net income before interest expense  income tax expense  non cash stock compensation expense and depreciation and amortization expense 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  since it removes the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results  as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations  to assess compliance with financial ratios and covenants included in credit facilities  in communications with lenders concerning our financial performance  and to evaluate the viability of potential acquisitions and overall rates of return 
how we manage our operations our management team uses a variety of tools to manage our operations 
these tools include monitoring service crew utilization and performance  equipment maintenance performance  customer satisfaction  and safety performance 
service crew performance 
we monitor our revenue on a per service crew basis to determine the relative performance of each of our crews 
we also measure our activity levels by the total number of jobs completed by each of our crews as well as by each of the trucks in our fleet 
we evaluate our crew and fleet utilization levels on a monthly basis  with full utilization deemed to be approximately jobs per month for each of our service crews and approximately jobs per month for each of our trucks 
by monitoring the relative performance of each of our service crews  we can more efficiently allocate our personnel and equipment to maximize our overall crew utilization 

table of contents equipment maintenance performance 
preventative maintenance on our equipment is an important factor in our profitability 
if our equipment is not maintained properly  our repair costs may increase and  during levels of high activity  our ability to operate efficiently could be significantly diminished due to having trucks and other equipment out of service 
our maintenance crews perform monthly inspections and preventative maintenance on each of our trucks and other mechanical equipment 
our management monitors the performance of our maintenance crews at each of our service centers by monitoring the level of maintenance expenses as a percentage of revenue 
a rising level of maintenance expenses as a percentage of revenue at a particular service center can be an early indication that our preventative maintenance schedule is not being followed 
in this situation  management can take corrective measures  such as adding additional maintenance personnel to a particular service center to help reduce maintenance expenses as well as ensure that maintenance issues do not interfere with operations 
customer satisfaction 
upon completion of each job  we encourage our customers to complete a pride in performance survey that gauges their satisfaction level 
the customer evaluates the performance of our service crew under various criteria and comments on their overall satisfaction level 
survey results give our management valuable information from which to identify performance issues and trends 
our management also uses the results of these surveys to evaluate our position relative to our competitors in the various markets in which we operate 
safety performance 
maintaining a strong safety record is a critical component of our operational success 
many of our larger customers have safety history standards we must satisfy before we can perform services for them 
we maintain an online safety database that our customers can access to review our historical safety record 
our management also uses this safety database to identify negative trends in operational incidents so that appropriate measures can be taken to maintain a positive safety history 
our industry and overview we provide products and services primarily to domestic onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production companies for use in the drilling and production of oil and natural gas 
the main factor influencing demand for well services in our industry is the level of drilling activity by oil and natural gas companies  which  in turn  depends largely on current and anticipated future natural gas and crude oil prices and production depletion rates 
long term forecast for energy demand suggests an increasing demand for oil and natural gas  which when coupled with flat or declining production curves  we believe should result over the long term in the continuation of historically high natural gas and crude oil commodity prices 
for example  the energy information administration of the us department of energy  or eia  forecasts that us natural gas consumption will increase at an average annual rate of through the eia also forecasts that us oil production will increase at an average annual rate of and natural gas production will increase at an average annual rate of 
the recent drop in commodity prices for oil and gas  coupled with the volatility in the equity and credit markets have caused some exploration and production companies to announce reductions in their capital spending 
although recently the volatility and weakness in natural gas and oil prices have caused natural gas and oil exploration and production companies to reduce their exploration and production expenditures 
we believe that over the long term oil and natural gas exploration and production companies will continue to expand their exploration and drilling activities to replace production from the high decline rate reservoirs 
in recent years  much of this expansion has focused on natural gas 
according to baker hughes rig count data  the average total rig count in the united states increased from in to  through the first week of february  while the average natural gas rig count increased from in to  through the first week of february however  the rig count began to decline in the fourth quarter of and has fallen precipitously in early with a current total rig count as of february  of approximately  rigs in the united states  compared to  rigs as of september   while the number of rigs drilling for natural gas has increased by more than since  and natural gas production has increased by only approximately over the same period 
this is 
table of contents largely a function of increasing decline rates for natural gas wells in the united states 
we believe  over the long term  a continued increase in us drilling and workover activity will be required for the natural gas industry to help meet the expected increased demand for natural gas in the united states 
business outlook the current economic and credit environment has lowered demand for energy and resulted in significantly lower prices for crude oil and natural gas 
demand for the majority of our services is dependent on the level of oil and gas expenditures made by our customers in the exploration and production industry 
these expenditures are sensitive to the oil and gas prices our customers receive for their production  the industry s view of future oil and gas prices and our customers ability to access the financial and credit markets 
during the last half of  the financial and credit markets weakened substantially and demand for natural gas and crude oil declined 
as a result  natural gas and crude oil prices have fallen sharply  which has caused a decline in the demand for our services as customers have reduced their exploration and production expenditures 
with the current commodity price and credit environment  we expect that drilling activity will be substantially lower in compared to  which we believe will reduce demand and prices we receive for our services 
if economic conditions continue to worsen  the demand for our services could continue to decrease as customers make further reductions in their oil and gas expenditures 
additionally  the reduction in cash flows being experienced by some of our customers due to lower commodity prices coupled with the weakening of the credit and capital markets could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
the extent and duration of the economic downturn and financial market deterioration is uncertain at this time  but we will continue to focus on labor cost efficiencies and monitor discretionary spending to respond to prevailing levels of activity 
our growth strategy our growth strategy contemplates engaging in organic expansion opportunities and  to a lesser extent  complementary acquisitions of other oilfield services businesses 
our organic expansion activities generally consist of establishing service centers in new locations  including purchasing related equipment and hiring experienced local personnel 
historically  many of our customers have asked us to expand our operations into new regions that they enter 
once we establish a new service center  we seek to expand our operations by attracting new customers and hiring additional local personnel 
our revenues from each operating region  and their relative percentage of our total revenue  consisted of the following dollars in thousands percent of percent of percent of region revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue revenue appalachian southeast southwest mid continent rocky mountain total we also pursue selected acquisitions of complementary businesses  such as our recent acquisition of the diamondback assets  both in existing operating regions and in new geographic areas in which we do not currently operate 
in analyzing a particular acquisition  we consider the operational  financial and strategic benefits of the transaction 
our analysis includes the location of the business  strategic fit of the business in relation to our business strategy  expertise required to manage the business  capital required to integrate and maintain the business  the strength of the customer relationships associated with the business and the competitive environment of the area where the business is located 
from a financial perspective  we analyze the rate of return the business will generate under various scenarios  the comparative market parameters applicable to the business and the cash flow capabilities of the business 

table of contents to successfully execute our growth strategy  we will require access to capital on competitive terms to the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations 
we intend to finance future acquisitions primarily by using capacity available under our bank credit facility and equity or debt offerings or a combination of both 
for a more detailed discussion of our capital resources  please read liquidity and capital resources 
our results of operations our results of operations are derived primarily by three interrelated variables market price for the services we provide  drilling activities of our customers  and cost of materials and labor 
to a large extent  the pricing environment for our services will dictate our level of profitability 
our pricing is also dependent upon the prices and market demand for oil and natural gas  which affect the level of demand for  and the pricing of  our services and fluctuates with changes in market and economic condition and other factors 
in recent months  increased capacity in certain of our operating regions has resulted in significant downward pricing pressure and increased discounts in our service prices 
we expect this downward pressure to continue in these regions until the level of activity increases to absorb the excess capacity or the amount of equipment and crews servicing these regions decreases through relocation to other regions with capacity 
to a lesser extent  seasonality can affect our operations in the appalachian region and certain parts of the mid continent and rocky mountain regions  which may be subject to a brief period of diminished activity during spring thaw due to road restrictions 
as our operations have expanded in recent years into new operating regions in warmer climates  this brief period of diminished activity has a lesser impact on our overall results of operations 
historical market conditions are reflected in the table below three months ended december  year ended december  change change average rig count crude oil natural gas total us land rigs commodity prices avg 
crude oil west texas intermediate bbl natural gas henry hub mcf estimate of activity as measured by average active us land drilling rigs based on baker hughes inc rig count information the current economic and credit environment has lowered demand for energy and resulted in significantly lower prices for crude oil and natural gas 
during the last half of  the financial and credit markets weakened and caused a drop in the demand for oil and gas 
as a result  oil and gas prices have fallen sharply  which has caused a decline in the demand for our services as customers have reduced their exploration and production expenditures 
with the current commodity price and credit environment  we expect that drilling activity will be substantially lower in compared to  which we believe will reduce demand and prices we receive for our services 
however  we believe our ability to service more technically complex plays  our participation in many of the most active drilling plays in the united states  as well as our regional strength in the appalachian region will generally help us to maintain a strong and competitive position 

table of contents results for the three months ended december  and our results of operations from our primary categories of services consisted of the following for each of the three month periods ended december  and three months ended december  statement of operations data revenue technical pumping services down hole surveying services completion services total technical services fluid logistics total revenue expenses cost of revenue selling  general and administrative total expenses operating income revenue the following table summarizes the dollar and percentage changes for the types of oilfield service revenues for the three month period ended december  when compared to the same period in dollars in thousands three months ended december  change change revenues by service type stimulation cementing nitrogen technical pumping services down hole surveying services completion services total technical services fluid logistics total revenue

the year over year revenue growth was driven by strong activity increases in our stimulation and cementing services 
the decrease in nitrogen revenues during the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of was due to a non recurring nitrogen project performed in increased activity levels at service centers that were established within the last twelve months new centers  as well as the diamondback asset acquisition completed in november  led to the increases in revenue in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of new centers and the diamondback asset acquisition represented million and million of the revenue increases between the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  sales discounts increased in high single digits in as compared to due to increased capacity and increased competition in certain of our operating regions which resulted in significant downward pricing pressure on our service prices 
new service centers historically have higher sales discounts than our established service centers because they typically price their services below competitors to initially penetrate new markets 
all of our operating regions experienced higher sales discounts for the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of our stimulation and cementing services continue to see the greatest downward pricing pressure 
during the fourth quarter of we saw the negative impact from reduction or elimination of fuel surcharges negotiated with several of our customers earlier in the year

new service center cost of revenue by operating region increased in by million  million  million and million in the appalachian  mid continent  southwest and rocky mountain operating regions  respectively 
the aggregate dollar increase in cost of revenues was due to the fact that these costs vary with revenue and higher activity levels 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this percentage increase between periods was primarily due to higher labor expense  depreciation and material costs as a percentage of revenue in as compared to additionally  higher sales discounts lowered net revenues and resulted in an increase in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue 
labor expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in when compared to due to lower utilizations than expected at new service centers established during delays in receiving equipment and regulatory permits deferred revenue producing activities at the new service centers opened during the second half of  which lowered our utilizations from our projected levels 
these delays postponed the opening of the clinton service center  which commenced operations during the third quarter of  and the brighton  artesia and rock springs service centers that were established in the fourth quarter of aggregate labor expenses in cost of revenue increased million to million in due to the hiring of additional personnel in connection with the establishment of new service centers and the expansion of existing service centers 
material costs as a percentage of revenues increased by to reach in as compared to higher sand transportation costs were the primary reason for the increase  as well as greater cement trucking costs for new service centers without bulk handling facilities

these decreases were partially offset by increased drilling activity by our customers in our existing service centers 
operating income in decreased by approximately million due to the five start up service centers established during the year 
it has been our experience that when we establish a new service center in a particular operating region  it may take from to months before that service center has a positive impact on the operating income that we generate in the relevant region

items impacting comparability of our financial results changes in our legal structure prior to our initial public offering in august  our operations were conducted by two separate operating partnerships under common control  superior well services  ltd 
and bradford resources  ltd 
pursuant to a contribution agreement among superior well  inc and the former partners of these two operating partnerships  the operations of these two partnerships were combined under a holding company structure immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering 
in december  bradford resources  ltd 
was merged into superior well services  ltd 
superior well services  ltd 
is a pennsylvania limited partnership that became a wholly owned subsidiary of superior well services  inc in connection with its initial public common stock offering 
superior well services  inc serves as the parent holding company for this structure 
following the closing of the contribution agreement and our initial public offering as discussed in note to our historical consolidated financial statements  we began to report our results of operations and financial condition as a corporation on a consolidated basis  rather than as two operating partnerships on a combined basis 
in november  superior purchased the pressure pumping  fluid logistics and completion  production and rental tool assets from diamondback energy holdings  llc diamondback 
in connection with the asset purchase  superior formed swsi fluids  llc to acquire the fluid logistics assets 
swsi fluids llc is a wholly owned subsidiary of superior 
prior to  we did not incur income taxes because our operations were conducted by two separate operating partnerships that were not subject to income tax 
in and prior  our historical combined financial statements of superior well services  ltd 
and bradford resources  ltd 
include a pro forma adjustment for income taxes calculated at the statutory rate resulting in a pro forma net income adjusted for income taxes 
prior to becoming a public company  partnership capital distributions were made to the former partners of our operating partnerships to fund the tax obligations resulting from the partners being taxed on their proportionate share of the partnerships taxable income 
as a consequence of our change in structure  we recorded a non cash adjustment of million to record the deferred tax asset and liabilities arising from the differences in the financial and tax basis of assets and 
table of contents liabilities that existed at that time 
following our initial public offering  we incur income taxes under our new holding company structure  and our consolidated financial statements reflect the actual impact of income taxes 
non cash compensation expense effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no

under this standard  companies are required to account for equity transactions using an approach in which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
our results of operations for the years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  of additional compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r and its application to the restricted stock awards that we primarily granted in january and liquidity and capital resources prior to the completion of our initial public offering  cash generated from operations  borrowings under our existing credit facilities and funds from partner contributions were our primary sources of liquidity 
following completion of our initial public offering  we have relied on cash generated from operations  public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to satisfy our liquidity needs 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of availability under our bank credit facilities that can be used for planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions 
we believe this is adequate to meet operational and capital expenditures needs in financial condition and cash flows financial condition our working capital increased million to million at december  compared to december   primarily due to a million increase in trade accounts receivable that resulted from higher revenue activities discussed above in our results of operations 
in addition  inventory increased by in due mainly to the diamondback asset acquisition and  to a lesser extent  higher inventory levels required to service the increase in revenue activities 
higher revenue activities and the diamondback acquisition caused accounts payable and other accrued liabilities to increase by million and million  respectively 
cash from operations along with draws on our revolving credit facility was used to fund capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaling million in cash flows from operations our cash flow from operations decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to december   primarily due to working capital requirements arising from the diamondback acquisition that occurred on november  the diamondback acquisition required the funding of operational working capital  which was not able to be offset by accounts receivable collections because billings were outstanding for a limited time at december  for a detailed comparison of and operating results please see our results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  working capital decreased cash flow from operations due to growth in accounts receivable  advance payments on materials for future delivery  inventory and prepaid expenses that resulted from higher revenue activities and the diamondback acquisition 
receivables  advance payments on materials for future delivery  inventory  and prepaid expenses increased by million  million  million and million  respectively for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  these decreases were partially offset due to higher amounts of deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization of million and million  respectively 
additionally  the decrease in cash flows from operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was offset due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and million  respectively 

table of contents cash flows used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to the diamondback asset acquisition 
during  non acquisition related expenditures for property  plant and equipment declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased million to million for the year ended december  superior s revolving credit facilities funded million for the diamondback and nuex asset acquisitions during additionally  the revolving credit facilities were used to fund the increase in working capital discussed above in financial condition 
capital requirements the oilfield services business is capital intensive  requiring significant investment to expand and upgrade operations 
our capital requirements have consisted primarily of  and we anticipate will continue to be expansion capital expenditures  such as those to acquire additional equipment and other assets or upgrade existing equipment to grow our business  and maintenance or upgrade capital expenditures  which are capital expenditures made to extend the useful life of partially or fully depreciated assets or to maintain the operational capabilities of existing assets 
we continually monitor new advances in pumping equipment and down hole technology and commit capital funds to upgrade and purchase additional equipment to meet our customers needs 
for the year ended december   we made capital expenditures of approximately million to purchase new and upgrade existing pumping and down hole surveying equipment 
additionally  we purchased operating assets from nuex wireline  inc nuex and diamondback energy holdings  llc diamondback 
the nuex assets were purchased for approximately million in cash 
superior purchased the pressure pumping  fluid logistics and completion  production and rental tools assets from diamondback for approximately million 
the diamondback acquisition consideration consisted of million in cash  million of series a convertible preferred stock million liquidation preference and million in second lien notes aggregating million plus million of transaction costs for a total purchase price of million 
these purchases and upgrades allow us to deploy additional services 
our capital expenditure budget is approximately million 
the decrease in the capital expenditure budget is due to the substantial decline in drilling rig activity which is expected to decrease the demand for our services 
we plan to monitor our servicing opportunities and expect to adjust our expenditures accordingly 
we plan to focus our planned capital expenditures budget on expanding our ability to service the marcellus shale activity in the appalachian region  as well as expanding our nitrogen and cementing capabilities in all of our operating regions 
given our objective of growth through organic expansions and selective acquisitions  we anticipate that we will continue to invest capital to acquire businesses and assets 
we plan to continue to monitor the economic environment and demand for our services and adjust our growth as necessary 
we actively consider a variety of businesses and assets for potential acquisitions  although currently we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisition 
for a discussion of the primary factors we consider in deciding whether to pursue a particular acquisition  please read our growth strategy 
management believes that cash flows from operations  combined with cash and cash equivalents and borrowing under our revolving credit facility will provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to manage our routine operations and fund capital expenditures that are presently projected

eitf critical accounting policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting standards have developed 
accounting standards generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve the implementation and interpretation of existing standards  and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable standards on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting standards are critical 
for further details on our accounting policies  please read note to the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenue and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is comprised principally of service revenue 
product sales represent approximately of total revenues 
services and products are generally sold based on fixed or determinable pricing agreements with the customer and generally do not include rights of return 
service revenue is recognized  net of discount  when the services are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally our services performed for customers are completed at the customer s site within one day 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the products are delivered to the customer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
products are delivered and used by our customers in connection with the performance of our cementing services 
product sale prices are determined by published price lists provided to our customers 
accounts receivable are carried at the amount owed by customers 
we grant credit to all qualified customers  which are mainly regional  independent natural gas and oil companies 
management periodically reviews accounts receivable for credit risks resulting from changes in the financial condition of our customers 
once an account is deemed not to be collectible  the remaining balance is charged to the reserve account 

table of contents property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated using the straight line and accelerated methods over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives range from to years for building and improvements  range from to years for disposal wells and equipment and range from to years for equipment and vehicles 
the estimated useful lives may be adversely impacted by technological advances  unusual wear or by accidents during usage 
management routinely monitors the condition of equipment 
historically  management has not changed the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment and presently does not anticipate any significant changes to those estimates 
repairs and maintenance costs  which do not extend the useful lives of the asset  are expensed in the period incurred 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we evaluate our long lived assets  including related intangibles  of identifiable business activities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is recalculated when related events or circumstances change 
when determining whether impairment of one of our long lived assets has occurred  we must estimate the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset or asset group 
our estimate of cash flows is based on assumptions regarding the future estimated cash flows  which in most cases is derived from our performance of services 
the amount of future business is dependent in part on natural gas and crude oil prices 
projections of our future cash flows are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  including but not limited to changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our services are located  the price of natural gas and crude oil  our ability to negotiate favorable sales arrangements  and our competition from other service providers 
we currently have not recorded any impairment of an asset 
any significant variance in any of the above assumptions or factors could materially affect our cash flows  which could require us to record an impairment of an asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  no amortization is recorded for goodwill and or intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for acquisitions completed after june  we perform our goodwill impairment test annually  or more frequently  if an event or circumstances would give rise to an impairment indicator 
our goodwill impairment test is performed at the business segment levels  technical services and fluid logistics  as they represent our reporting units 
per sfas  the impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill  and uses a future cash analysis based on the estimates and assumptions for our long term business forecast 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is deemed to be not impaired 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the impairment loss  if any 
this second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill  and if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference 
any impairment charge would reduce earnings 
for the years ended december  and  the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amount  thus no impairment charge was recorded 

table of contents at december   our intangible assets consisted of million of goodwill and million of customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements that are amortized over their estimated useful lives which range from three to five years 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded amortization expense of   and  respectively 
contingent liabilities we record expenses for legal  environmental and other contingent matters when a loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by governmental regulators and the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely  particularly our outstanding litigation  we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities 
insurance expenses we partially self insure employee health insurance plan costs 
the estimated costs of claims under this self insurance program are accrued as the claims are incurred although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may subsequently be revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the self insurance accrual is estimated based upon our historical experience  as well as any known unpaid claims activity 
judgment is required to determine the appropriate accrual levels for claims incurred but not yet received and paid 
the accrual estimates are based primarily upon recent historical experience adjusted for employee headcount changes 
historically  the lag time between the occurrence of an insurance claim and the related payment has been approximately two months and the differences between estimates and actuals have not been material 
the estimates could be affected by actual claims being significantly different 
presently  we maintain an insurance policy that covers claims in excess of  per employee 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this standard  companies are required to account for equity based awards using an approach in which the fair value of an award is estimated at the date of grant and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
compensation expense is adjusted for equity awards that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not satisfied 
our results of operations for the years ended december   and include   and  of additional compensation expense  respectively  as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
we had no stock based compensation prior to impact of inflation inflation can affect the costs of fuel  raw materials and equipment that we purchase for use in our business 
we are generally able to pass along any cost increases to our customers  although due to pricing commitments and the timing of our marketing and bidding cycles there is generally a delay of several weeks or months from the time that we incur a cost increase until the time we can pass it along to our customers 
most of superior s property and equipment was acquired in recent years  so recorded depreciation approximates depreciation based on current dollars 
management is of the opinion that inflation has not had a significant impact on our business

when used in this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  may  and similar expressions  as they relate to us and our management  identify forward looking statements 
the actual results of future events described in such forward looking statements could differ materially from the results described in the forward looking statements due to the risks and uncertainties set forth below  under the heading risk factors and elsewhere within this annual report on form k a decrease in domestic spending by the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry  a decline in or substantial volatility of natural gas and crude oil commodity prices  current weaknesses in the credit and capital markets and lack of credit availability  overcapacity and competition in our industry  unanticipated costs  delays and other difficulties in executing our growth strategy  including difficulties associated with the integration of the diamondback acquisition  the loss of one or more significant customers  the increased credit risk of our customers  the loss of or interruption in operations of one or more key suppliers  the incurrence of significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from our failure to comply with new or existing environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment  and other financial  operational and legal risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risk to which we are exposed is the risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
to a lesser extent  we are also exposed to risks related to increases in the prices of fuel and raw materials consumed in performing our services 
we do not engage in commodity price hedging activities 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our floating rate borrowings  each of which have variable interest rates based upon  at our option  libor or the prime lending rate 
the impact of a increase in interest rates on our outstanding debt as of december  and december  would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income  of less than million and million annually  respectively 
concentration of credit risk 
substantially all of our customers are engaged in the oil and gas industry 
this concentration of customers may impact overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions 
two customers individually accounted for and in  and in and and in of our revenue 
eight customers accounted for  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   one customer accounted for and eight customers accounted for of our accounts receivable 
commodity price risk 
our fuel and material purchases expose us to commodity price risk 
our material costs primarily include the cost of inventory consumed while performing our stimulation  nitrogen and cementing services such as frac sand  cement and nitrogen 
our fuel costs consist primarily of diesel fuel used by our various 
table of contents trucks and other motorized equipment 
the prices for fuel and the raw materials in our inventory are volatile and are impacted by changes in supply and demand  as well as market uncertainty and regional shortages 
historically we were generally able to pass along price increases to our customers  due to pricing commitments and the timing of our marketing and bidding cycles there is generally a delay of several weeks or months from the time that we incur a price increase until the time that we can pass it along to our customers 
given the current economic conditions and the decline in the overall demand for certain types of our services we may be unable to pass these price increases on to our customers
