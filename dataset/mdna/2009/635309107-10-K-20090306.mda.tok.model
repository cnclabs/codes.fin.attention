overview ncm operates the largest digital in theatre network in north america  for the distribution of advertising  business communications  and fathom events 
our revenue is principally derived from the sale of advertising and  to a lesser extent  from our cinemeetings and fathom events businesses 
we have long term esas with ncm llc s founding members and multi year agreements with several other unrelated theatre operators  whom we refer to as network affiliates 
the esas with the founding members and network affiliate agreements grant us exclusive rights  subject to limited exceptions  to sell advertising and meeting services and distribute entertainment programming in those theatres 
our advertising  cinemeetings and fathom events are distributed primarily to theatres that are digitally equipped with our proprietary dcn technology 
in excess of of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theatre attendance is included in our digital network 
management focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators for us to manage our business and to determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets  and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate 
senior executives hold monthly meetings with managers and staff to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business 
we focus on many operating metrics including changes in oibda  adjusted oibda and adjusted oibda margin  as defined and discussed in item selected financial data notes to the selected historical financial and operating data  as some of our primary measurement metrics 
in addition  we pay particular attention to our monthly advertising performance measurements  including advertising inventory utilization  pricing cpm  local and total advertising revenue per attendee and the number of cinemeetings and fathom event locations and revenue per location 
finally  we monitor our operating cash flow and related financial leverage debt divided by ebitda  as defined in the debt agreement and revolving credit facility availability and cash balances to ensure that debt obligations and future declared dividends can be met while providing adequate cash cushions

the results of operations data for the period ended december  are presented in two periods  the

we have a week or week fiscal year ending on the first thursday after december fiscal years and contained weeks while fiscal year contained weeks 
throughout this document  we refer to our fiscal years as set forth below fiscal year ended reference in this document january  december  period december  through february  pre ipo period december  period february  through december  post ipo period december  results of operations year ended january  and the pre and post ipo periods revenue 
total revenue of the company for the year ended january  was million compared to million for the post ipo period and million for the pre ipo period  an increase of million  or over the combined pre and post ipo periods 
the increase in total revenue was the result of an increase in advertising revenue of including revenue from our founding member beverage concessionaire agreements  or beverage revenue that commenced on february  and a increase in meetings and events revenue 
national advertising revenues of million including million of beverage revenue for the year ended january  increased from million including million of beverage revenue of combined revenue for the pre and post ipo periods  reflecting the strong second half of scatter market that offset a weak first half of and an increase in payments from the founding member beverage concessionaire agreements 
national advertising revenue excluding beverage revenue for the year ended january  increased million or to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the combined pre and post ipo periods  primarily due to a increase in cpms excluding beverage revenue and increase in advertising impressions available for sale  which was offset by a decrease in national advertising inventory utilization excluding beverage revenue to from 
the decrease in utilization is due primarily to the increase in advertising impressions related primarily to affiliate theatres added to our network in the second half of and  on which there is generally a ramping up period associated with new affiliate additions as those new screens are integrated into client proposals 
the increase in payments from the founding members related to their beverage concessionaire agreements was due to the fact that payments did not begin until the ipo date offset by a reduction in contracted beverage advertising time from seconds to seconds by one of our founding members during local advertising revenue increased million or to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the combined pre and post ipo periods 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in total average screens in our advertising network  including amc loews 
local revenue per theatre attendee remained consistent for the full year of compared to combined pre and post ipo periods at per attendee  despite the addition of network affiliate theatre screens and over  amc loews screens to which we did not have full inventory access until december due to certain run out provisions 
total advertising contract value per attendee for the year ended january  was per attendee  which represents a decrease of compared to pre and post ipo periods 
the slight decrease in the 
table of contents advertising contract value per attendee was primarily due to the impact of integrating new network affiliate and amc loews screens into our sales process 
there is generally a three month lag time once the theatres have been connected to our network before they are fully integrated into our sales process 
meetings and events revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to the combined pre and post ipo periods as a result of a increase in the number of events and due to the success of several fathom events 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses for the year ended january  were million compared to million for the post ipo period and million for the pre ipo period 
the increase in compared to the combined pre and post ipo periods was primarily the result of an increase in advertising operating costs and selling and marketing costs  which are the result of the increase in the size of our network and a higher percentage of network affiliate screens and an increase in meetings and events operating costs which are the result of the increase in the number of events 
advertising operating costs 
advertising operating costs of million for the year ended january  increased over the combined million pre and post ipo period 
this increase was primarily the result of the increase in the number of network affiliate screens and associated payments made to our advertising affiliates pursuant to our contractual agreements under which the payment is based on a percentage of revenue displayed in those theatres 
network affiliate screens represented of total network screens for versus in meetings and events operating costs 
meetings and events operating costs of million for the year ended january  increased compared to million during the combined pre and post ipo periods due to a increase in the number of events and the high level of variable event expenses associated with those events 
network costs 
network costs of million for the year ended january  increased compared to million for the combined pre and post ipo periods due primarily to the increase in size of our network as well as operating costs associated with our internet site 
total network screens operated during increased to  from  in  or an increase of approximately 
theatre access fees circuit share costs 
theatre access fees were million for the year ended january  compared to million for the post ipo period 
the circuit share expense for the pre ipo period was million 
the decrease for versus the combined pre and post ipo periods was the result of changes in the payment structure in the esas that became effective upon the completion of the ipo discussed above  combined with a february increase in the rate per digital screen  offset by a slight decrease in founding member attendance 
selling and marketing costs 
selling and marketing costs increased to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the combined pre and post ipo periods  or an increase of 
selling and marketing costs have increased primarily due to an expansion in the local sales force and an increase in local sales commissions associated with increased sales and higher direct marketing costs associated with the increase in the number of cinemeetings and fathom events 
there was also an increase in the provision for bad debt reflecting the broader local client base and higher local revenue 
administrative and other costs 
administrative and other costs for the year ended january  was million compared to million for the combined pre and post ipo periods  an increase of primarily due to increased professional fees and personnel costs associated with being a public company and additional personnel associated with the growth in our network and higher activity in our meetings and events division 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in compared to the combined pre and post ipo periods primarily as a result of increased depreciation on additional equipment in network affiliate theatres and investments in software development and other network 
table of contents infrastructure made to support the growth of our network and amortization expense recognized on additional intangible assets recorded related to activity associated with the annual common unit adjustment 
net income loss 
net income generated for the year ended january  was million compared to net income for the post ipo period of million and a net loss for the pre ipo period of million due to an increase in operating income  decreased income taxes and minority interest  which was offset by a non operating impairment charge and higher net interest expense 
the increase in net interest expense is primarily due to a million non cash charge to interest expense related to the change in the status of our interest rate hedge of our senior secured credit facility due to the bankruptcy of lehman as discussed in note and to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document  partially offset by lower market interest rates on the unhedged portion of our debt 
the million non operating impairment charge related to our investment in a start up advertising company as discussed in note and note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the decrease in income taxes is due to lower pre tax income and lower effective state income tax rate  partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate caused primarily by a valuation allowance we recorded against the deferred tax asset related to the non operating impairment charge 
the decrease in net minority interest is primarily due to the lower amount of income allocable to the minority interest  caused by the items discussed above offset by additional common membership units issued in pre and post ipo periods and the year ended december  revenue 
total revenue of the company for the post ipo period was million  while total revenue for the pre ipo period was million  as compared to million during the twelve months ended december  the increase in the aggregate periods over the period was primarily the result of payments from the founding member beverage agreements  increase in national advertising inventory utilization and cpm  an increase in local advertising sales  the conversion or assignment of certain legacy contracts and increasing meetings and events revenue 
the aggregate national advertising revenue for the periods increase of related primarily to an increase in national advertising inventory utilization to from  a increase in cpms  an increase in non inventory on screen and lobby revenue and a increase in founding member attendance 
local advertising revenue increased by primarily due to an increase in screens and time sold 
the meeting and events revenue increase of related to an increase in fathom revenue due to an increase in event count of approximately  primarily for the met  offset by decrease in revenue for cinemeetings due to a decrease in event count 
total advertising contract value per attendee for the company for the post ipo period was  while the total advertising contract value per attendee was for the pre ipo period and during the year ended december  the increase in the advertising contract value per attendee for the combined post ipo period and pre ipo period versus the year ended december  was primarily the result of increased inventory utilization through an increase in expenditures from certain existing clients and the expansion of our advertising client base 
the increase was also due to an increase in sales of non inventory on screen and lobby revenue  such as the sale of branded content segments  cell phone trailer segments and lobby promotional items 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses for the post ipo period were million  million during the pre ipo period and million for the year ended december  the increase of the combined post ipo period and pre ipo period versus total operating expenses for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the increase in local sales commissions and event costs associated with the increase in fathom revenue discussed above and increased expenses due to additional staffing and infrastructure required to support the increase in the number of advertising contracts  expansion of the network and public company compliance costs 

table of contents non cash costs associated with our equity incentive plan also contributed to the increase in administrative expenses 
share based compensation expense for the post ipo period was million  while the expense was million for the pre ipo period and million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in share based compensation expense is primarily due to the plan being in place for the entire post ipo and pre ipo periods  while it was only in place for nine months of the twelve months ended december  as the options were originally issued in the second quarter of and additional grants made at the time of the ipo 
theatre access fees circuit share costs 
theatre access fees of the company for the post ipo period were million  while circuit share expense was million during the pre ipo period and million during the year ended december  the decrease for the post ipo period versus the ncm llc pre ipo period and the year ended december  was primarily the result of the amended and restated esas that became effective upon the completion of the ipo 
net income loss 
net income generated by the company for the post ipo period was million  while for the pre ipo period there was a net loss of million and there was a net loss of million during the year ended december  the increase in the profitability of the company for the post ipo period versus the periods prior to the ipo was due to the increase in revenue and decrease in payments to the founding members discussed above  partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the new credit facilities and the income taxes and expenses associated with the tax receivable agreement and minority interest expense associated with the new corporate structure 
the comparability of the net income of the periods presented is limited due to the differing lengths of the periods  size of our network and changes in the corporate structure and capitalization 
known trends and uncertainties the current challenging macro economic environment and current weak advertising environment in general  present uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  including the timing and amount of spending from our advertising clients and collections of accounts receivable 
however  we are cautiously optimistic that the impact to our business will be mitigated due to factors including the growth in our advertising client base  the effectiveness of cinema advertising relative to other mediums  and the impact of our broader national network and the related increase in salable impressions 
in addition  our advance bookings for at the end of were approximately higher than bookings were at the end of as noted previously  in we added three large circuits to our network with the addition of kerasotes and hollywood  and the integration of amc loews 
these additions have added nearly million new attendees on a full year pro forma basis  representing approximately a billion new salable advertising impressions 
our sales force has integrated these additional impressions into the advertising sales process during and we expect that the yield on these attendees should be higher in than in in addition  we believe that these new circuits will strengthen our selling proposition in comparison to other national advertising platforms 
it should be noted  however  that while our local advertising business is benefiting from the expansion of screens in our network  it has begun to be adversely affected by the impact of the current economic downturn on our local customers and their advertising spending 
under the esas  up to seconds of the firstlook program can be sold to our founding members to satisfy their on screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements 
during  we sold seconds to two of our founding members and seconds to the third 
in  all three founding members will acquire only seconds  thereby reducing our beverage revenue received from our founding members 
however  this inventory previously sold to the founding members will now be available for sale to our national advertising clients  which could reduce the impact of the lower founding member commitment 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an other than temporary impairment on our investment in ideacast and the long term asset representing the value of the call right to convertible debt in ideacast 
the 
table of contents impairment was recorded in the fourth quarter of as there were substantive changes in the circumstances surrounding ideacast s operations  including default under terms of their debt covenants and the emergence of liquidity issues  among other items 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for additional details of the transactions with ideacast 
in addition  ideacast s lender has an option to put  or require us to purchase up to million of the funded convertible debt at par  on or after december  through march  we have recorded an estimated liability on the put obligations  which we have recorded to other long term liabilities of million at january  refer to note and note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document for additional details of the put 
ideacast is currently in the process of negotiating a restructuring of its debt and certain other agreements  however we cannot be certain when or if a restructuring will be completed 
we believe that if a restructuring arrangement is reached that it will likely include a revision or unwinding of the terms of the put and call agreement with the lender and as a result ncm likely will own a continuing interest in the assets of ideacast 
if a restructuring cannot be achieved  or if the actual net obligation is different than our estimated value  there could be an adverse effect to future earnings  however we believe any such amount would be immaterial 
financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources as of january   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance was million  an increase of million compared to the balance of million as of december  ncm llc has an aggregate revolving credit facility commitment of million with a consortium of banks 
on september   lehman brothers holdings inc lehman filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
ncm llc s revolving credit facility includes million with lehman commercial paper inc lcpi  a subsidiary of lehman 
as of january   ncm llc has borrowed million from lcpi under the revolving credit facility 
lcpi failed to fund its undrawn commitment of million 
ncm llc does not anticipate lcpi to fulfill its funding commitment 
such reduced funding is not expected to be required to meet our liquidity needs 
until the lcpi issues are resolved  ncm llc is not anticipating repaying any of its revolver borrowings as it would effectively result in a permanent reduction of its revolving credit facility  to the extent of the payments against lcpi borrowings 
in addition  while the bankruptcy court has authorized lcpi to resign as the administrative agent under the revolving credit facility  to the company s knowledge they have not yet done so 
we do not expect lcpi to fulfill their commitment to fund this remaining amount 
however  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to conduct our normal operations and do not expect the events with lehman to have a material impact on our liquidity 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding lehman s bankruptcy 
the increase in our liquidity position from december  was due to cash flow generated from operating activities and to a lesser extent additional net borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
we do not expect to make repayments to reduce our revolving credit facility 
cash flows in millions

 post ipo period ended dec 
 pre ipo period ended feb 
 year ended dec 
 operating cash flow investing cash flow financing cash flow operating activities 
the increase in funds provided by operating activities for the year ended january  versus the combined pre and post ipo periods was primarily due to higher 
table of contents revenue levels  changes in the timing of the collection of accounts receivable balances  the timing of payments for normal operating expenditures and lower payments to the founding members related to the transition from a circuit share to a theatre access fee structure after the ipo 
investing activities 
the change in investing cash flows for the year ended january  versus the combined pre and post ipo periods was primarily due to converting short term cash investment funds into cash  offset by higher levels of capital expenditures primarily associated with the purchases of equipment and related installation costs necessary to expand our network in network affiliate theatres and to a lesser extent investments in our new website 
in addition  during the post ipo period we utilized million to invest in ideacast  an unconsolidated affiliate 
financing activities 
the change in financing cash flows for the year ended january  versus the combined pre and post ipo periods was primarily due to net borrowings on our revolving credit facility  decreased by funds used in for available cash distributions to our founding members and dividend payments 
in  we had funds generated from net proceeds related to the ipo and net borrowings on our senior secured credit facility 
our cash balances will fluctuate due to the timing of collections of accounts receivable balances and operating expenditure payments  as well as available cash payments as defined to ncm llc s founding members  interest payments on our term loan  income tax payments  tax sharing payments to our founding members and quarterly dividends to our common shareholders we expect to pay pursuant to our dividend policy 
sources of capital and capital requirements 
ncm  inc s primary source of liquidity and capital resources are distributions from ncm llc 
ncm llc s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are generated by its operating activities 
management believes that future funds generated from ncm llc s operations and cash on hand should be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  ncm llc s debt service requirements  and capital expenditure and other investing requirements  through the next months 
cash flows generated by ncm llc s distributions to ncm  inc and the founding members can be impacted by the seasonality experienced in advertising revenues at ncm llc 
ncm llc is required pursuant to terms of the operating agreement effective as of february  to distribute its available cash  as defined in the operating agreement  to its members the founding members and ncm  inc 
the available cash distribution to the members of ncm llc for the year ended january  was million  of which million was ncm  inc s portion 
ncm  inc will use cash received from the available cash distributions to fund income taxes  payments associated with the tax sharing agreement with the founding members and current and future dividends as declared by the board of directors  including a dividend declared in january of per share approximately million which will be paid on april  distributions from ncm llc and ncm  inc cash balances should be sufficient to fund ncm  inc s tax sharing payments to the founding member circuits  income taxes and its regular dividend 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures of ncm llc have typically been related to equipment required for our noc and content production and post production facilities  digital content system and back office capitalized software upgrades developed primarily by our programmers  office leasehold improvements  desktop equipment for use by our employees  and in certain cases  the costs necessary to digitize all or a portion of a network affiliate s theatres when they are added to our network 
capital expenditures for the year ended january  were million including million associated with network affiliate additions compared to million including million associated with network affiliate additions for the post ipo period and million for the pre ipo period 
the capital expenditures have typically been satisfied through cash flow from operations 
all capital expenditures related to the dcn within ncm llc s founding members theatres have been made by the founding members under the esas 
we expect they will continue to be made by the founding members in accordance with the amended and restated esas 
we expect to make approximately million to million of capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for upgrades to our digital content system  distribution software and our internal management systems  
table of contents including our advertising inventory optimization  management and reporting systems  our internet site and network equipment related to newly built network affiliate theatres 
we expect these upgrades and improvements to our management reporting systems  which are intended to provide additional advertising scheduling and placement flexibility for our clients  should enhance our operating efficiencies  including allowing us to better manage our advertising inventory  and prepare us for continued growth 
these capital expenditures may be increased should we decide to add any additional network affiliates to our network 
we expect that these additional expenditures  if any  would be funded in part by additional cash flows associated with those new network affiliates 
the commitments associated with our operating lease requirements are included in contractual and other obligations below 
we also expect depreciation and amortization to increase over with a full year of amortization of the intangible asset and addition of the future common unit adjustment intangible assets 
financings senior secured credit facility 
on february   concurrently with the closing of the ipo of ncm  inc  ncm llc entered into a senior secured credit facility with a group of lenders 
the facility consists of a six year million revolving credit facility and an eight year  million term loan facility 
the net proceeds of the term loan were used  together with million of proceeds from the offering  to redeem all the preferred membership units of ncm llc for an aggregate price of million 
the term loan will be due on the eighth anniversary of the funding 
the revolving credit facility portion is available  subject to certain conditions  for general corporate purposes of the company in the ordinary course of business and for other transactions permitted under the credit agreement  and a portion is available for letters of credit 
the obligations under the credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of ncm llc 
the outstanding balance of the term loan facility at january  was million 
the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at january  was million 
as of january   the effective rate on the term loan was including the effect of the interest rate swaps both those accounted for as hedges and those not 
the interest rate swaps hedged million of the million term loan at a fixed interest rate of while the unhedged portion was at an interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rate on the unhedged revolver was 
commencing with the fourth fiscal quarter in fiscal year  the applicable margin for the revolving credit facility will be determined quarterly and will be subject to adjustment based upon a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio for ncm llc and its subsidiaries defined in the ncm llc credit agreement as the ratio of secured funded debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  over adjusted ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement 
the senior secured credit facility also contains a number of covenants and financial ratio requirements  with which the company was in compliance at january   including the amount of debt that is required to be hedged 
the debt covenants require of the term loan  or million to be hedged at a fixed rate 
as of january   the company had approximately hedged 
of the million that is hedged  million is with lehman brothers special financing lbsf  a subsidiary of lehman 
the lbsf portion is in default as a result of the lehman and lbsf bankruptcies 
excluding the lbsf portion  the company had approximately of its term loan hedged 
while not required in order to be in compliance with its debt covenants  the company is evaluating whether to seek a replacement hedge for the lbsf portion 
in addition  while the bankruptcy court has authorized lbsf to assign certain of its hedges that have not been terminated under certain circumstances  the company has not received any notice that lehman has assigned  or has entered into any negotiations to assign  its swap agreement with ncm llc 
critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies of ncm llc are described in note of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions 
table of contents made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of ncm llc 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in its trade receivables  which represent a significant asset on the balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses based on historical loss experience  consideration of current economic trends and conditions and debtor specific factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
account receivable balances are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged are credited to the allowance 
a provision for bad debt is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for bad debt could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
revenue recognition 
ncm llc considers estimates regarding make good provisions in advertising revenue to be a critical accounting policy that requires mathematical calculations used to determine the shortfall of advertising impressions delivered 
on screen advertising revenue is recognized in the period in which theatre attendees impressions are provided 
on screen advertising revenue is recorded net of make good provisions to account for delivered attendance that is less than the amount contracted 
the amount contracted is based on an estimate of attendees at the date the contract is signed 
when actual attendance  based on amounts reported by the founding members  is less than contracted  a make good provision is required 
share based compensation 
the company s equity incentive plan is treated as an equity plan under the provisions of sfas no 
r  and the determination of fair value of options for accounting purposes requires that management make complex estimates and judgments 
we utilize the black scholes option price model to estimate the fair value of our options 
this model requires that the company make estimates of various factors used 
the following assumptions were used in the valuation of the options expected life of options the expected life of the options is determined by using the average of the vesting and contractual terms of the options the simplified method as described in sec staff accounting bulletin 
due to the short length of time over which our options have been outstanding  the company has not developed a historical option exercise experience and has determined that the simplified method is a reasonable basis to estimate the expected life of the options 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is determined by using the applicable treasury rates as of the grant dates  commensurate with the expected terms of the options 
expected volatility ncm closed its ipo on february  since the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is shorter than the contractual terms of our options  we believe historical volatility may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
as a result  we estimate expected volatility based on comparable companies and industry indexes for historic stock price volatility 
until such time as we have sufficient historical information to derive an implied volatility we expect to continue to use this method as long as we believe such companies are comparable to us 
dividend yield the estimated dividend yield was determined using management s expectations based on estimated cash flow characteristics and expected long term dividend policy 
fair value estimation 
ncm llc considers estimates regarding the fair value of our investment in ideacast  inc and the associated call right and put obligation on the convertible debt in ideacast to be a critical accounting policy that requires significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the company s preferred stock investment in ideacast  inc  which is accounted for as an available for sale debt security  requires significant management judgment because the securities  along with the call right and put obligation  are not publicly traded and as a result there is no readily determinable fair value 
through the third quarter of  the company based its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flows model 
table of contents that probability weighted ideacast s potential future cash flows under various scenarios using certain assumptions such as the number of installed clubs  capital expenditures per club installation  advertising inventory  utilization rate and cpm as significant inputs 
management s judgment was used to consider additional factors including  but not limited to product development activity  whether there have been significant changes  positive or negative  in the prospects for ideacast s business  and the overall health of ideacast and its industry 
as of january   management s judgment was required to assess whether the investment and the call option were impaired  and if so  whether the impairment was temporary or other than temporarily impaired 
in addition  management s judgment was required to assess whether a loss should be recorded under the contingent liability under the put option 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 as clarified by fin no 
 which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax amounts are determined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under currently enacted tax law 
valuation allowances are to be established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we currently have a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize such assets in future periods 
in addition  due to the basis differences resulting from our ipo date transactions and subsequent adjustments pursuant to the common unit adjustment agreement  and entry into the tax receivable agreement with our founding members  we are required to make cash payments to the founding members in amounts equal to of our actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the basis difference for certain deferred assets noted above 
the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  as amended  are highly technical and complex and involve management s judgment  including judgments to determine hypothetical taxing outcomes exclusive of the ipo date transaction and agreements 
if we were to fail to meet certain of the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  we could be subject to additional payments to taxing authorities or to our founding members 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we are subject to examination by tax authorities for years beginning with recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our business operations  see the information provided under note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document

off balance sheet arrangements our operating lease obligations  which primarily include office leases  are not reflected on our balance sheet 
see contractual and other obligations for further detail 
we do not believe these arrangements are material to our current or future financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources or capital expenditures 

table of contents contractual and other obligations our contractual obligations at january  were as follows payments due by period total after in millions borrowings future interest on borrowings office leases long term liability put obligation network affiliate agreements total contractual cash obligations the amounts of future interest payments in the table above are based on the amount outstanding on the term loan  estimated rates of interest over the term of the variable rate portion and the rates in effect on our interest rate swap 
the terms of the senior secured credit facility required us to hedge the cash flow variability of interest for at least of the term loan 
in march of  ncm llc entered into fixed interest rate swap arrangements hedging million million of which is with lehman of the million senior secured credit facility at a fixed interest rate of 
in addition  we have a variable rate revolving credit agreement 
debt service requirements under this agreement depend on the amounts borrowed and the level of the base interest rate  in addition to a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
see further discussion of the secured credit facility under financial condition and liquidity financings above 
the value in this table represents the maximum potential payout 
the obligation is recorded in other liabilities as a contingent liability at its estimated cost of million  which is net of the estimated value of the assets that would be received upon the exercise of the put right

the amended and restated esas entered into at the completion of our ipo require payments based on a combination of founding member attendance and the number of digital screens of each founding member 
the amount relating to the attendance factor will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year as theatre attendance varies while the amount relating to the screens factor will be more predictable but will also vary quarter to quarter and year to year as screens are converted to digital screens and other screens are added or removed through acquisition  divestiture or closure activities of the founding members 
the payments made to founding members also will vary due to the escalation of the rates paid for each factor pursuant to the amended and restated esas 
the table above does not include amounts payable under the amended and restated esas as they are based on variable factors  which are not capable of precise estimation 
the tax receivable agreement entered into at the completion of our ipo provides for the payment by us to the founding members of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of certain increases in our proportionate share of tax basis in ncm llc s tangible and intangible assets 
the payments to the founding members are based  in part  on actual annual income and as such  will vary based on our operating results 
the table above does not include amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as they are based on variable factors  which are not capable of precise estimation 

table of contents seasonality the levels of revenue  operating income  net income  oibda and adjusted oibda are seasonal in nature  coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients and to the quarter s film revenue and related attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry 
advertising expenditures tend to be higher during the second  third  and fourth fiscal quarters and are correlated to new product releases and marketing cycles and higher theatre attendance 
theatrical attendance is generally highest during the summer and year end holiday season coinciding with the release of blockbuster films 
as a result  we typically have less revenue  operating income  net income  oibda and adjusted oibda and our operating margins are lower in the first quarter than the other quarters of a given year 
given this variability  the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next or any future quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would affect interest costs relating to the variable portion of our senior secured debt facility  which is not covered under the hedging agreement 
we have entered into a fixed interest rate swap arrangements that hedge million of the million term loan at a fixed interest rate of 
as of january   we are faced with uncertainty regarding the million portion of the interest rate swap agreement with lehman as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  with respect to which lbsf is in default 
if that portion of the swap were terminated  there would be an additional million of unhedged variable rate debt outstanding and a basis point fluctuation in market interest rates would have increased or decreased our interest expense by approximately million for an annual period on a total of million of unhedged debt 
because each of our interest rate swaps  including the one with lehman  was in a liability position at january   we are not currently exposed to counterparty risk related to the swaps
