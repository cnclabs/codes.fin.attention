annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  critical accounting policies in general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies detailed in footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements contained herein  those dealing with valuation of securities and other assets  revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable involve a particularly high degree of judgment and complexity 
our accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understand ing these policies is important to understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
off balance sheet risk we execute securities transactions on behalf of our customers 
if either the customer or counter party fails to perform  we  by agreement with our clearing broker  may be required to discharge the obligations of the non performing party 
in such circumstances  we may sustain a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract value of the transaction 
we seek to control off balance sheet risk by monitoring the market value of securities held or given as collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
pursuant to such guidelines  our clearing firm requires that we reduce positions when necessary 
we also complete credit evaluations where there is thought to be credit risk 
reserves we record reserves related to legal proceedings in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
many factors are considered including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or representatives  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge or credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual costs upon di sposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserved amount 
risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
risk management is critical to our financial strength and profitability and requires robust auditing  constant communications  sound judgment and knowledge of financial trends and the economy as a whole 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process 
the principal risks involved in our business activities are market  operational  regulatory and legal 
market risk market risk is the risk attributable to common macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product  employment  inflation  interest rates  budget deficits and consumer sentiment 
consumer and producer sentiment is critical to our business 
the level of consumer confidence determines their willingness to spend  especially in the financial markets 
it is the willingness to spend in the financial markets that is key to our business 
a shift in spending in this area could negatively impact us 
in addition  declines in market values negatively impact investment advisory revenues that are based upon the value of assets under management 
we constantly monitor these economic trends in order to enhance and broaden our product line to mitigate potential negative impact of such trends 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution of transactions  deficiencies in our technology or financial or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes 
managing these risks is critical  especially in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volume 
failure to manage these risks could result in material financial loss to the company 
to mitigate these risks  the company has developed policies and procedures designed to identify and manage operational risk 
these policies and procedures are reviewed and updated on a continuing basis by a broad based risk committee that meets weekly to ensure that risk is minimized 
regulatory and legal risk regulatory and legal risk includes non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk of a large number of customer claims that could result in adverse judgments against us 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which it operates  and we maintain a panoply of procedures to address issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
however  compliance procedures  no matter how stringent and comprehensive  can only limit  but not totally prevent  the institution of regulatory and legal proceedings  the outcomes and consequences of which typically cannot be reasonably foreseen or quantified 
in the normal course of business  we continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our alleged activities as a broker dealer or investment advisor  as an employer or as a result of other business activities 
in line with general industry experience  the volume of such complaints has trended upward during the current financial downturn 
effects of inflation our assets primarily are liquid in nature and not significantly affected by inflation 
management believes that the replacement cost of property and equipment will not materially affect operating results 
however  the rate of inflation can affect our expenses  including  without limitation  employee compensation and benefits  communications and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided 
key indicators of financial performance we periodically review and analyze our financial performance across a number of measurable factors considered to be particularly useful in understanding and managing our business 
key metrics in this process include adjusted ebitda as defined below  productivity and practice diversification of representatives  top line commission and advisory services revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  legal costs  taxes and earnings per share 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  comparison of fiscal years ended march  and the following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations  capital resources and liquidity and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report

adjusted ebitda eliminates items that we believe are not part of our core operations  are non recurring items of revenue or expense  or do not involve a cash outlay  such as stock related compensation 
we consider adjusted ebitda important in monitoring and evaluating our financial performance on a consistent basis across various periods 
we also use adjusted ebitda as a primary measure  among others  to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions 
adjusted ebitda is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by regulation g promulgated by the sec under the securities act of  as amended 
adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  important gaap financial measures including pre tax income  net income and cash flows from operating activities 
items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant and necessary components to the operations of our business  therefore  adjusted ebitda should only be used as a supplemental measure of our operating performance

annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  productivity and practice diversification of representatives management believes that improving the overall quality of our independent representatives is a key to achieving growth in revenues and net income 
we believe that upgrading the business practices of our representatives not only generates more revenue  but assists in limiting the cost of overhead functions and representative noncompliance 
we strive to continually improve the overall quality of our force of representatives by assisting representatives to improve their skills and practices  recruiting established  high quality representatives  and terminating low quality representatives 
productivity a key metric that we use to assess the average quality of our producing non staff representatives is per capita rep generated revenue based on a rolling month period 
data for the month periods ended march  and are presented below 
year ended increase march  march  incease decrease decrease rep generated revenue commission   advisory    other fee income    number of representatives average revenue per representative  we believe that the decline in per capita rep generated revenue compares favorably with percentage drops in revenue widely experienced in comparable segments of the financial industry during the twelve months ended march  practice diversification we encourage diversification of the array of investments products and services offered by our independent representatives through our recruitment practices and education and training programs 
first and foremost  this enables our representatives to more fully serve the investment and security needs of their clients  particularly in volatile markets 
recruitment of representatives who are duly qualified to offer sophisticated investment products to their clients historically also has resulted in growth of transaction and fee based business that  in addition to generating relatively high margins  are expected to help us endure a volatile down market due to recurring revenues generated by these types of services 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  revenues revenues decreased by million  or  to million  led by a million or decline in commissions offset by a million or increase in advisory services revenue 
the decline in commissionable revenues was mostly attributed to a drop off in investments in our check and application business 
decreased investments in this category reflected the current economic environment 
revenues from advisory services increased primarily as a result of the relocation of assets from brokerage commission accounts to investment advisor accounts due to the repeal of the regulatory rule commonly referred to as the merrill lynch rule 
otherwise revenues from advisory services would have remained relatively flat for the comparative twelve month periods 
the merrill lynch rule sec rule  which allowed fees based on assets in a client s brokerage account ie  fee based commissions  was repealed and  effective october   assets were required to be relocated to either investment advisor accounts or commission based brokerage accounts 
the new rule prohibits brokerage representatives from charging a fee for investment advice on brokerage accounts unless they are registered as investment advisor representatives under the investment advisor act 
commissions commission revenue fell by  led by a drop in variable annuities  brokerage and direct mutual funds sales 
these decreases reflected a significant decline in financial asset values and resulting flight from these product categories to investments regarded to be more secure  including money market funds and treasury bonds 
fiscal year ended increase percentage percentage march  decrease of total increase decrease vs 
decrease vs 
commission revenue variable annuities  brokerage    direct participation programs    direct mutual funds sales    other    total commission revenue  revenue designated as brokerage includes revenue from mutual funds sold through our trading platform 
advisory responding to industry trends and increasing client demand  we have endeavored to assist our representatives in transitioning more of their business to advisory services 
we do not dictate the general nature or extent of advisory services our representatives provide for their clients 
however  we continue to make concerted efforts to attract our representatives to our expanded line of proprietary advisory services programs through education  seminars  tradeshows and direct telemarketing 
our advisor directed managed assets program  a map  where investment advisory services are provided directly by our independent representatives  continues to be the leading source of advisory services revenue 
revenues from this program decreased by million or due to a decrease in assets under management which  in turn  reflected a drop in new investment dollars driven principally by market wide declines in asset values 
supported by our net exchange pro and pershing direct on line mainframe brokerage platforms  a map is still popular with our representatives because of the opportunities it provides to deliver superior asset management services and overall investment performance at a lower cost 
resulting transactional cost savings have been passed on to our representatives clients in the form of lower fees for improved service 
the increase in total advisory revenue principally reflected the relocation of assets from fee based brokerage accounts into advisory fee accounts due to the repeal of the above described merrill lynch rule 
in addition  there was a million increase in revenues from new investment in our ica directed f map program 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  other fee income other fee income  primarily comprised of administrative fees for licensing as well as financial planning fees  decreased by primarily due to a decline in fees on administering our registered representatives errors and omissions policy 
marketing revenue net marketing revenues decreased by principally due to a decrease in marketing support revenue based on declining product sales 
in addition  we experienced a decrease in net event revenue for sponsored company events due to increases in costs to organize and provide these events 
other income other income  consisting primarily of interest and dividends and gains losses on investments  decreased by 
the majority of the decrease came from a decrease in interest income associated with a decrease in cash held at bank accounts

annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  gross margin gross margin of total gross margin gross margin retention gross margin change year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  vs

gross margin decreased by million  or  to million led by a million  or  decline in gross margin derived from our direct check and application programs 
also contributing to this decrease was a million or decrease in profit margin from other income and a million decrease from marketing 
finally  other fees profit margin decreased by million or 
check and application the decrease in gross margin from our check and application business reflected an across the board decline in investments in check and application products including variable annuities  mutual funds and direct participation programs such as reit and oil and gas programs 
profit margins from mutual fund sales  variable annuity sales  direct participation programs and other check and application distribution programs generated million in gross margin  representing of the total gross margin  compared to million or during the prior period 
for the first time  our check and application distribution programs dropped from first to second place  behind brokerage  as a contributor to overall gross margins 
brokerage brokerage services profit margin increased by million primarily due to an increase in recurring revenues that do not require commission payouts from to of total brokerage revenue 
market volatility generated an increase in trading volume out of equities and into less volatile investments  like money markets 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  advisory services there was a decrease in volume of new investment in our advisory service programs due to the difficult economic conditions 
as a result  margins from our a map program  which comprised the largest input to our advisory margins  decreased 
however  gross margins from our f map program increased  reflecting success by our in house icas advisors in increasing the average assets under management compared to the prior period 
although check and applications remains a significant source of revenue and profit margin  the company has been focusing particularly on growing business activity in the brokerage and advisory services sectors believing that such diversification will help buttress overall revenues and margins in the current volatile market 
commission and advisory fees profit margins are inversely related to payout of commissions and advisory fees to our independent representatives 
management monitors the amount of revenue an independent representative produces as compared to the corresponding payout on that revenue 
margin retention is enhanced by the recruitment of independent representatives who generate recurring revenue that does not flow through the commission and advisory expense payout grid 
commission and advisory fee expenses during the current period were million versus million in the prior period 
as a percentage of revenue generated by representatives ie  commissions  advisory fees and other fees  commission and advisory expenses declined slightly from to in the current year 
these expenses include commissions to representatives  clearing costs and other direct costs that are necessary to produce revenue 
management continuously monitors these costs as they have a substantial effect on our profit margin 
operating expenses overall  operating expenses remained relatively flat for reasons discussed below 
compensation and benefits the largest component of operating expense  compensation and benefits  decreased by million or 
the drop in compensation is attributed principally to a lack of bonuses granted during the current period  as prior period bonuses to executives and employees totaled million 
in addition  there were savings of million related to employee and salary reductions  the resignation of an officer  and lower compensation from the issuance of restricted stock awards 
regulatory  legal and professional regulatory  legal and professional expenses increased by million or 
the largest components of this increase were a million increase in lawsuit settlement expenses  and a million increase in legal fees to defend us in those lawsuits  which were offset by insurance recoveries on related matters of million 
finally  we incurred an additional million in legal fees in handling strategic corporate governance matters 
we will continue to incur legal fees and settlement costs as it operates in a regulated industry that is increasingly litigious 
consequently  we will continue to invest significant resources to contain future litigation and regulatory exposure by promoting accuracy  ensuring sound operational techniques and applying appropriate compliance measures 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  advertising advertising  including related marketing and branding efforts  along with meals and entertainment decreased by million  or 
beginning in our prior fiscal year  we began aggressively branding and placing advertisements in financial services trade publications to communicate to prospective representative recruits the fundamental role that our customer service  technology infrastructure and back office support can play in maintaining and growing their businesses 
reflecting prevailing economic conditions  during the current year we reduced our marketing by million  or 
communications communications expenses  which include such items as company sponsored conferences  telephone and connectivity costs and investor relations  were consistent with levels during the prior year  however  in the near future we are looking to further expand and improve our website as an effective media for communicating to our independent representative force 
occupancy occupancy expenses decreased by million  or reflecting the closing of our various investment centers  as well as consolidation of our staff into one home office 
other administrative other administrative expenses  which include various insurance  loan reserves  postage  office and computer related expenses  increased by million or primarily due to a million increase in regulatory fines and a million increase in bad debt expense from allowance and write offs on representative loans 
interest expense interest expense decreased by reflecting lower margin balances in our firm accounts and reduced rates on e o insurance financing 
operating and net losses largely impacted by weakened financial market conditions  including the recession affirmed in october   we recognized operating and net losses for the two most recent fiscal years 
revenues over the first six months of the fiscal year ended march  held steady compared to the prior year  at million despite restrained consumer spending and mounting illiquidity and credit concerns 
however  our operating loss for the full fiscal year grew to million compared to million for the prior year  reflecting the deepening economic downturn as well as substantial expenses incurred in defending and settling certain legal proceedings that eroded our operating margins 
results of operations also were negatively impacted by cash and equity based employee compensation and related income tax expenses  additional to base salary  totaling million and million during the fiscal years ended ma rch  and  respectively 
significant reductions in operating costs implemented during the latter part of the most recent fiscal year were insufficient to stem a full year net loss of million compared to the million loss posted for the prior year 
we cannot forecast the severity or longevity of the impact on our operations and financial position that may result from a continuation of troubling financial conditions 
much of such future impact is inherently beyond our control 
however  with the cost of recently settled litigation behind us  we are focused on continuing to reduce redundant operating costs  upgrade operating efficiency  recruit quality representatives and grow our revenue base while improving support and supervision of our registered representatives 
investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources we believe that achieving a return on equity goals requires the efficient use of capital 
historically  we have financed our operations primarily with positive cash flows from our core broker dealer and investment advisory business 
the current recession s market volatility  economic conditions affecting unemployment and the real estate market may continue to have a negative impact on cash flows 
we work to minimize this impact by both bench marking operating needs to employ effective cost controls and aggressively recruiting preferred representatives who can meet the needs of their clients in an ever changing economy 
we take a proactive approach to minimizing the occurrence and impact of events that may lead to unpredictable cash outflows  including major legal proceedings  trade errors  and fines and other sanctions imposed by regulatory agencies such as finra  the sec and state securities regulators 
accordingly  we have been allocating considerable resources to stay current with the many rules and regulations applicable to our business and to provide up to date education and training to our staff and independent representatives 
a key to this approach is ensuring that adequate controls over our operations and those of our representatives are implemented and periodically updated 
as part of this effort  substantial resources have been committed to enhancing the capabilities of our compliance team  whose tasks include assuring that our representatives give adequate attention to the circumstances and interests of their clien ts when recommending investment options 
cash inflows historically have come primarily from our broker dealer and investment advisory business 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents totaled million as compared to million as of march  working capital as of march  was million as compared to million as of march  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of march  as compared to to as of march   impacted by the use of matured treasury notes for operating costs 
operations provided million in cash for the year ended march  as compared to million of cash provided for the year ended march  in comparing cash flow from operating activities for fiscal year ended march  to fiscal year ended march   cash flows increased by million largely because we received income tax refunds for overpayments and a million in a receivable for a related insurance recovery 
also  operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the increase in accrued expense for legal reserves  which had material impact on the results from operations 
cash flows from investing activities during the current period primarily consisted of million in cash provided from treasury notes and certificates of deposit maturing offset by million of cash used to purchase additional property and equipment 
also during the current period cash used in financing activities consisted mostly of million in principal payments on a short term note to finance insurance premiums along with proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
cash flows from investing activities for the prior year primarily consisted of million in cash provided from treasury notes maturing offset by million in cash used to invest in a certificate of deposit and million of cash used to purchase additional equipment  furniture and fixtures 
cash used in the prior year for financing activities consisted mostly of million in principal payments on a short term note obligation to finance insurance premiums along with a million payment of cash dividends on march  for stockholders of record as of february  investors capital holdings  ltd 
annual report on form k fiscal year ended march  disbursements during the fiscal years ended march  and associated with legal proceedings and the turmoil in financial markets initially induced by the sub prime mortgage crisis have had a significant negative impact on our brokerage firm s net capital ratio 
whether or not expenses associated with legal proceedings will be reduced in the future may in no small measure depend upon the degree to which we succeed  through a continually evolving and robust compliance regime  in assuring that the firm and its independent representatives operate in conformity with the many laws  rules and regulations pertaining to our broker dealer and investment advisory operations 
regulatory net capital cash disbursements can have a material impact on our brokerage firm s net capital 
the sec uniform net capital rule rule c requires that icc  our broker dealer subsidiary  maintain net capital of  and a ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital a net capital ratio not to exceed to under the rule  indebtedness generally includes all money owed by icc  and net capital includes icc cash and assets that are easily converted into cash 
sec rules also prohibit equity capital which  under the net capital rule  includes subordinated loans from being withdrawn  cash dividends from being paid and other specified actions of similar effect from being taken  if  among other specified contingencies  icc s net capital ratio would exceed to or if icc would have less than of its minimum required net capital 
as of march   icc had net capital of million ie  an excess of million and a to net capital ratio as compared to net capital of approximately million ie  an excess of million and a to net capital ratio as of march  the significant change was the result of ich infusing million of capital into the broker dealer through the conversion of inter company indebtedness 
the loss reported was not fully reflected in our net capital due to non cash expenses including million from the vesting of the restricted stock awards that were issued to employees and executives  million in depreciation  and million from other non cash expenses 
given the current unsettled economic and financial market conditions  we are focused on rapidly implementing measures designed to ensure the continued maintenance of adequate capital  facilitate growth and improve profitability
