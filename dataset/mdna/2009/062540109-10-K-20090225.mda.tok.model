critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
the most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions or judgments to be made based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates 
those policies have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than reported if there is a change to any of the estimates  assumptions  or judgments made by us 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions  and judgments used  we identified the determination of the reserve for credit losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of leased asset residual values  the fair value of financial instruments  the valuation of pension and postretirement benefit obligations  and the determination of income tax expense and liability to be the accounting estimates that are the most subjective or judgmental 
reserve for credit losses a consequence of lending activities is that we may incur losses 
the amount of such losses will vary  depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions  including rising interest rates  and the financial performance of borrowers 
the reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve 
the reserve for credit losses provides for credit losses inherent in lending or committing to lend and is based on loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation  reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit 
table of contents judgment to address observed changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors 
the allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans and leases  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios  and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
on a quarterly basis  an evaluation of specific individual commercial borrowers is performed to identify impaired loans and leases 
also  on a quarterly basis  the audit committee of the board of directors reviews and approves the reserve for credit losses prior to final affirmation by the board of directors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the reserve for credit losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights when mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
an estimated fair value is used because there is no quoted or established market for valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service  and interest rates that reflect the risk involved 
our estimates of the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are sensitive to changes in the underlying estimates and assumptions 
had we assumed lower interest rates and higher loan repayment rates  the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights could have been lower than recorded in our consolidated statements of condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on mortgage servicing rights 
valuation of leased asset residual values lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
our determination of residual value is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals  and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until lease termination  the cyclical nature of equipment values  and the limited marketplace for re sale of certain leased assets  are important variables considered in making this determination 
we update our valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more often when events or circumstances warrant 
when we determine that the fair value is lower than the expected residual value at lease expiration  the difference is recognized as an asset impairment in the period in which the analysis is completed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the residual value of leased assets 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are actuarially determined based on a number of key assumptions  including the discount rate  estimated future return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
our determination of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash out flows for benefit payments and cash in flows for maturities and return on plan assets 
changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
the discount rate used to value the future benefit obligation as of each year end is the rate used to determine the periodic benefit cost in the following year

income taxes we determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulation and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation 
currently  we file tax returns in federal  state and local domestic jurisdictions  and four foreign jurisdictions 
in estimating income taxes payable or receivable  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position 
accordingly  previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted  through the provision for income taxes 
changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax law  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position 
these changes  when they occur  affect accrued income taxes and can be significant to our operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes

plan financial objectives and earnings summary our plan was prepared with the expectation that economic growth in hawaii could slow in and beyond 
our plan was based on assumptions of moderate growth in revenues and consistent  positive operating leverage 
our plan also allowed us to adjust for economic softness as we became increasingly cautious in our plan is to grow with the markets that we serve  while maintaining our conservative risk profile 
in  the us economy  and in particular the financial services industry  faced unprecedented challenges

table of contents analysis of business segments our business segments are retail banking  commercial banking  investment services  and treasury 
our management accounting process measures the performance of the business segments based on the management structure of the company 
this process  which is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution  uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments  including allocations of income  expense  the provision  and capital 
this process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and other subjective factors 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to us generally accepted accounting principles 
we evaluate several performance measures of the business segments  the most important of which are net income after capital charge niacc and risk adjusted return on capital raroc 
niacc is economic net income less a charge for the cost of allocated capital 
the cost of allocated capital is determined by multiplying our estimate of a shareholder s minimum required rate of return on the cost of capital invested for by the segment s allocated equity 
we assume a cost of capital that is equal to a risk free rate plus a risk premium 
raroc is the ratio of economic net income to risk adjusted equity 
equity is allocated to each business segment based on an assessment of its inherent risk 
the net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to our overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis 
the basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of our assumptions that are subject to change based on changes in current interest rates and market conditions 
funds transfer pricing also serves to transfer interest rate risk to treasury 
however  the other business segments have some latitude to retain certain interest rate exposures related to customer pricing decisions within guidelines 
adjustments to allocated net income include the replacement of the provision with the higher of an economic provision or the provision  the replacement of the hedge effectiveness of our mortgage servicing rights with an amortization approach  the reversal of an earnings credit related to the allowance  as well as the tax effect of these adjustments 
the economic provision is a statistically derived estimate of annual expected credit losses over an economic cycle 
we consider niacc to be a measure of shareholder value creation 
our niacc was million in  million in  and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our business segments

market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
our market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling  and managing risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance  while limiting volatility 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
our trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers 
our other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose our balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk the objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
the potential cash flows  sales  or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities  especially those that earn or pay interest  are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing relationships  and repricing characteristics of financial instruments 
our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the monetary policies of the frb influence  to a significant extent  the overall growth of loans  investment securities  and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
in managing interest rate risk  we  through the asset liability management committee alco  measure short and long term sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
the alco utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk  which include adjusting balance sheet mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities  changing product pricing strategies  modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio  or using derivative financial instruments 
the use of derivative financial instruments  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  has generally been limited 
this is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans  investment securities with deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by alco 
natural and offsetting hedges reduce the need to employ off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures 
expected movements in interest rates are also considered in 
table of contents managing interest rate risk 
thus  as interest rates change  we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk 
a key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset liability simulation model 
the model is used to estimate and measure the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit pricing  repayment rates on mortgage based assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model s analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  we believe that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the simulation model attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet 
we utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
table presents  for the next twelve months subsequent to december    and  an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual change in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve  relative to the measured base case scenario 
the base case scenario assumes the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged 
based on the net interest income simulation as of december   our consolidated statement of condition is slightly asset sensitive to parallel changes in interest rates 
net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  was more sensitive to changes in interest rates as compared to the sensitivity profiles as of december  and  particularly in higher interest rate scenarios 
late in  market conditions were very uncertain 
economic conditions led consumers to a flight to safety 
government intervention caused interest rates to fall to unprecedented levels and introduced significant market volatility 
in addition  credit spreads remained wide relative to historic levels 
these factors have contributed to greater interest rate risk to the company as of december  net interest income sensitivity profile table change in net interest income december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points to analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner  non parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated 
these non parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time 
conversely  if the yield curve should steepen further from its mostly normal profile  net interest income may increase 
we also use the market value of portfolio equity mvpe sensitivity analysis to estimate the net present value change in our net assets ie  assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet instruments from changes in interest rates 
the mvpe was approximately billion as of december   and approximately billion as of december  and table presents  as of december    and  an estimate of the change in the mvpe that would occur from an instantaneous and basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve 
the mvpe sensitivity increased as of december  compared to december  as a result of unusually low interest rates and extremely wide market spreads as of december  a further significant parallel decline in interest rates effectively creates a interest rate environment which greatly reduces the estimated value of both our loans and deposits 

table of contents market value of portfolio equity sensitivity profile table change in market value of equity as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates basis points further enhancing the mvpe sensitivity analysis are value at risk metrics  key rate analysis  duration of equity analysis  and exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures  however  used along with the mvpe sensitivity analysis  we obtain better overall insight for managing our exposures to changes in interest rates 
based on the additional analyses  we estimate that our greatest exposure is in scenarios where medium term interest rates decrease on a relative basis more than long term interest rates 
liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to ensure that we have continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funds 
funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings  liability issuances and settlements  and off balance sheet funding commitments 
we consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  we may alter our asset  liability  and off balance sheet positions 
the alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs  we actively manage our assets and liabilities 
the potential sources of short term liquidity include interest bearing deposits as well as the ability to sell certain assets including investment securities available for sale 
assets generate long term liquidity through cash flows from investment securities and loans 
with respect to liabilities  short term liquidity is generated from securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term funding sources such as federal funds while long term liquidity is generated through growth in deposits and long term debt 
we strengthened our liquidity position in  with increased levels of commercial and consumer deposits 
total deposits were billion as of december   a million or increase from december  as a result  cash and cash equivalents were million as of december   an increase of million from december  in february  we repaid million in privately placed fixed rate notes

capital management the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on our financial statements

these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy
