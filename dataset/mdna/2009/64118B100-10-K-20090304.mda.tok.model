item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a semiconductor company that designs  develops and sells proprietary high performance processors and high speed integrated circuits that are used by original equipment manufacturers oems in routers  switches  wireless infrastructure equipment  network security appliances  datacenter servers  network access equipment and network storage devices to accelerate the delivery of voice  video  data and multimedia content for advanced enterprise  datacenter  communications and mobile wireless networks 
our knowledge based processors  plps  and network search engine products are incorporated in systems used throughout multiple types of networks that comprise the global internet infrastructure  including the enterprise  metro  access  edge and core networking markets  and are designed into systems offered by leading networking oems such as alaxala networks corporation  alcatel lucent  arris group  inc  brocade communication systems  inc  cisco systems  inc  huawei technologies co  ltd  and juniper networks  inc 
the products and technologies we have developed and acquired are targeted to enable our customers to develop systems that support the increasing speeds and complexity of the internet infrastructure 
we believe there is a growing need to include knowledge based processors and high speed integrated circuits in a larger number of such systems as networks transition to all internet protocol ip packet processing at increasing speeds 
the equipment and systems that use our products are technically complex 
as a result  the time from our initial customer engagement design activity to volume production can be lengthy and may require considerable support from our design engineering  research and development  sales  and marketing personnel in order to secure the engagement and commence product sales to the customer 
once the customer s equipment is in volume production  however  it generally has a life cycle of three to five years and requires less ongoing support 
in general  we recognize revenue from sales of our products upon shipment to our customers or our international stocking sales representatives 
usually  we sell the initial shipments of a product for a new design engagement directly to the oem customer 
once the design enters volume production  the oem frequently outsources its manufacturing to contract manufacturers who purchase the products directly from us 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business is less capital intensive than others because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our products 
in general  we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures aside from business acquisitions that we might make from time to time 
in the future  as we launch new products or expand our operations  however  we may require additional funds to procure product mask sets  order elevated quantities of wafers from our foundry partners  perform qualification testing and assemble and test those products 
because we purchase all wafers from suppliers with fabrication facilities and outsource the assembly and testing to third party vendors  a significant portion of our costs of revenue consists of payments to third party vendors 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our suppliers and rely upon them to fulfill our orders 
on october   we completed the merger and acquisition of aeluros  inc the aeluros acquisition 
the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination during the fourth quarter of fiscal we paid million in cash upon the closing of the transaction in exchange for all of the outstanding equity securities of aeluros 
we reserved  shares of common stock for future issuance upon the exercise of unvested employee stock options of aeluros that we assumed and are subject to continued employment vesting requirements 
in addition  under the terms of the definitive agreement  we paid million cash in february based on the attainment of revenue performance milestones for the acquired business over the one year period following the close of the transaction 
approximately million of the initial purchase price has been withheld and placed in escrow as a form of security for certain indemnification and other obligations of the former aeluros stockholders 
some of our challenges in fiscal and in fiscal include improving operating efficiencies in the light of recently deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  diversifying our product offerings and inventory management 
while we achieved a year over year growth in total revenue from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year  we did experience a quarter over quarter decline in revenue from million for our third fiscal quarter in to million for our fourth fiscal quarter in we believe the decrease in demand was primarily due to macroeconomic conditions that decreased customer demand for our products 
we also expect revenue for the first quarter of fiscal to decline further relative to the first quarter of fiscal in response  we have focused on operating efficiencies and lowered our operating expenses from million for the third quarter of fiscal to million for our fourth fiscal quarter in we expect to remain focused on maintaining our operating expenses at an appropriate level relative to our revenue during this period of macroeconomic weakness 
for the years ended december    and  our top five customers accounted for approximately  and of total product revenue  respectively 
favorable market trends  such as the increasing number of gigabit ports as enterprises and datacenters upgrade their legacy networks to better accommodate the proliferation of video and virtualization applications  growth in the cable infrastructure area of our business  and the growing mobile wireless infrastructure and iptv markets  have enabled us to broaden our customer base and increase demand for our knowledge based processors and network search engines 
additionally  we have further diversified our customer and product revenues by expanding our product portfolio to address layer content processing with our netl processor family  the layer physical layer with our gigabit ethernet products  and entry level equipment with our netlite processors 
as an integral part of our efforts to diversify our product and customer base  as well as strengthen our competitive positioning  and broaden our technology portfolio and research and development capabilities  we have entered into strategic acquisitions of products and technology  including the acquisition of the tcam products and sahasra algorithmic technology from cypress and the acquisition of aeluros and its plp products 
cisco and its contract manufacturers have accounted for a majority of our historical revenue  although the percentage of our overall revenue attributable to cisco and its contract manufacturers declined for at cisco s request  in the third and fourth quarters of  we transitioned into a just in time inventory arrangement covering substantially all of our product shipments to cisco and its contract manufacturers 
pursuant to this arrangement we deliver products to wintec industries wintec based on orders they place with us  but we do not recognize product revenue unless and until wintec reports that it has delivered the product to cisco or its contract manufacturer to incorporate into its end products 
given this arrangement  unless cisco or its contract manufacturers take possession of our products from wintec in accordance with the schedules provided to us  our predicted future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts  and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  because we own the inventory physically located at wintec until it is shipped to cisco and its contract manufacturers  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  causing our total inventory levels to increase 
this  in turn  could increase our expenses associated with excess and obsolete product and negatively impact our cash flows 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make fair and reasonable estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and operating expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue mainly from product sales and  to a lesser extent  from engineering services 
historically  except for shipments to one distributor  we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  legal title and risk of ownership has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
our sales agreements do not provide for any customer acceptance provisions 
we have no obligation to provide any modification or customization  upgrades  enhancements  post contract customer support  additional products or enhancements 
customers  generally  have no rights of return unless the product does not perform according to specifications 
provisions for warranty expenses are recorded when revenue is recognized 
we entered into a purchase agreement with wintec industries who has become the primary purchaser of our products on a consignment basis for resale to cisco and its contract manufacturers 
we generally recognize revenue when wintec ships our product to cisco or its contract manufacturers 
from time to time we perform engineering services for third parties 
engineering service revenue is recognized as services are performed  agreed upon milestones are achieved and customer acceptance  if required  is received from the customer 
inventory valuation and adverse purchase commitments 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these estimates are generally based on a month forecast prepared by management 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional adjustment to inventory valuation may be required 
the carrying value of inventory and the determination of possible adverse purchase commitments are dependent on our estimate of the yield that will be achieved  or the percent of good products identified when the product is tested 
warranty accrual 
our products are subject to warranty for a period ranging from one to five years from the date of sale and we provide for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product in the accompanying statements of operations 
we estimate our warranty accrual based on historical claims compared to historical revenue and assume that we will have to replace products subject to a claim 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in order to determine the collectability of our accounts receivable  we continually assess factors such as previous customer transactions and the credit worthiness of the customer 
to date  our accounts receivable write offs have been immaterial 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
in general  we establish such allowances for accounts aged over days from the invoice date  unless specific circumstances indicate that the balance is collectible 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
in applying sfas  we are required to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we reassessed the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net deferred tax assets which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
in the first quarter of  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  and related guidance 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
refer to note income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item for further information 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flow 
applying the provision of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired 
we perform the goodwill impairment assessment at the company level  which is the sole reporting unit 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended december  significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluation of carrying value of goodwill 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes merton valuation model the black scholes model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r  and sab  as allowed by sab the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock and future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using a combination of the historical and implied volatility of the company s common stock 
changes in the subjective assumptions required in the valuation models may significantly affect the estimated value of the awards  the related stock based compensation expense and  consequently  our results of operations

research and development expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increases in payroll related expenses of million  product development and qualification expenses of million  and consulting and outside vendor expenses of million  which were partially offset by a decrease of stock based compensation expense of million 
the increase in payroll related expenses resulted primarily from increases in engineering headcount in india to support our new product development efforts  and in the us as a result of the aeluros acquisition 
the increase in product development and qualification expense was primarily due to the production qualification and characterization of our newly introduced knowledge based processors 
the remainder of the increase in research and development expenses was caused by individually minor items

selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended december   as compared with fiscal  primarily due to increased commission expenses of million  payroll related expenses of million  amortization expense of intangible assets customer relationships of million  consulting and outside vendor expense of million  other professional services fess of million  stock based compensation expense of million  and travel expense of million 
the increase in commission expenses was primarily a result of our increase in revenue 
the increase in payroll related expenses and stock based compensation expense resulted primarily from increased headcount to support our growing operations in the sales and marketing areas 
the remainder of the fluctuation in selling  general and administrative expenses was caused by individually minor items 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we focused on lowering operating expenses which resulted in a decline in expenses in that quarter to million from million in the previous quarter

during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million 
our effective tax rate of for the year ended december  was primarily driven by a rate differential for book income generated in foreign jurisdictions and the tax impact of non deductible stock options 
stock based compensation under sfas no 
r on january   we adopted sfas r  on the modified prospective application method  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases outstanding as of and awarded after january  the total stock based compensation expense recognized for the year ended december   and was as follows in thousands year ended december  cost of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative total stock based compensation expense in addition  we capitalized approximately million and million of stock based compensation in inventory as of december  and which represented indirect manufacturing costs related to our inventory

revenue for the year ended december  increased by million compared with the year ended december  revenue from sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers represented of our total revenue for the year ended december   compared with during the year ended december  the decrease in sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers was primarily due to the implementation of cisco s vendor managed inventory program during the second half of which resulted in lower levels of inventory at cisco as well as the implementation of a just in time inventory model the second quarter of by solectron corporation  one of cisco s contract manufacturers 
the revenue loss attributable to the implementation of these new manufacturing models in was partially offset by increased revenues of new products to cisco including the nl  nl  nl and tcam products which increased million from the decrease in sales to cisco and its contract manufacturers was mitigated by an increase in revenue from our non cisco customers  which totaled million during the year ended december   compared with million during the year ended december  the increase in sales to non cisco customers was primarily driven by the increasing demand for our products in several emerging new markets  such as gigabit ethernet  cable infrastructure and iptv  in addition to the enterprise networking infrastructure market that has driven the demand for our products historically 
the average selling price of our products decreased approximately from primarily due to increased revenues of our network search engine products into the high volume desktop switching segment 
in addition  we began shipping our newly acquired gigabit ethernet plps in the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   alcatel lucent accounted for of our total product revenue compared with in cost of revenue gross profit gross margin 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased primarily due to the addition of intangible asset amortization expense and recording of the fair value inventory adjustments resulting from the acquisition of the tcam products from cypress semiconductor corp

the increase in product development and qualification expense was primarily due to the production qualification and characterization for the nl and nl processors 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was primarily due to the issuance of stock based compensation options and awards for additional engineering headcount  including the new employees who joined us through the aeluros acquisition 
the increase in payroll related expenses was primarily due to an increase in our engineering headcount in india to support our new product development efforts and the incremental employees as a result of the aeluros acquisition 
depreciation expense increased by million during the year ended december  as we purchased software and other tools to support our research and development efforts 
the remainder of the increase in research and development expenses was caused by individually minor items 

table of contents in process research and development 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of in process research and development iprd charge related to the aeluros acquisition 
the value assigned to iprd was determined by considering the importance of products under development to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the purchased iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the fair values of iprd were determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rate of used in the present value calculations was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted to reflect additional risks related to the product s development and success as well as the product s stage of completion 
at december   we estimated that the aggregate costs to complete the projects would be million 
as of december   the projects had been completed 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of iprd charge related to our acquisition of the nse business from cypress based upon our estimate of the fair values of assets acquired 
we acquired only one iprd project from cypress  which was related to the acquired sahasra algorithmic technology  that had not reached technological feasibility  and had no alternative use 
the sahasra algorithmic technology complemented our layer processing initiative and was a beneficial building block in driving towards low cost layer applications acceleration and security processing solutions 
as of december   we had completed the iprd project and incurred total post acquisition costs of approximately million 
we expect to benefit from it beginning in fiscal  which is consistent with our original estimate 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the year ended december  compared with fiscal  primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expense of million  payroll related expenses of million  accounting fees of million  legal expenses of million  consulting and outside vendor expenses of million  amortization of intangible assets expense of million and recruiting fees expenses of million 
the increase in stock based compensation expense and payroll related expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our growing operations

during the year ended december   we recorded income tax benefit of million  which included the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net deferred tax assets and the tax impact of an intercompany license agreement 
during the third fiscal quarter of  we reassessed the valuation allowance previously recorded against our net deferred tax assets which consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
based on our earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources financial condition at december   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments which totaled million 
in february  we paid million to the former aeluros stockholders due to attainment of post acquisition revenue milestones  subject to certain adjustments as provided in the aeluros acquisition agreement the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested with financial institutions in deposits that  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
the company had not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents as of december  however  we believe that the capital and credit markets have been experiencing unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption and that recent us sub prime mortgage defaults have had a significant impact across various sectors of the financial markets  causing global credit and liquidity issues 
we can provide no assurance that our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments will not be adversely affected by these matters in the future 
the table below in thousands sets forth the key components of cash flow for the years ended december    and year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash flows during the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   which primarily consisted of million of net income  million of non cash operating expenses and million in changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash operating expenses for the year ended december   included depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million  and provision for inventory reserve of million  offset by deferred income taxes  net of million  and tax benefit from stock based awards of million 
changes in operating assets and liabilities were primarily driven by an increase in deferred margin of million  inventory of million  other liabilities of million and accounts payable of million on higher product sales  offset by a decrease in accounts receivables of million  accrued liabilities of million  which includes the million aeluros post acquisition revenue milestone  and prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december   of which we used million for the purchase of short term investments  and million to purchase computer equipment and research and development design tools to support our growing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these capital expenditures will be used primarily to support product development activities 
we will use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily from proceeds of stock option exercises of million  and tax benefit from stock based awards of million 
cash provided by financing activities was offset by repayment of software license and other obligations of million 
cash flows during the year ended december  during the year ended december   our operating activities generated net cash of million 
during the period  we recorded non cash items of million primarily consisting of stock based compensation of million  depreciation and amortization of million  in process research and development charge of million related to the aeluros acquisition  provision for inventory reserve of million  offset by net impact of deferred tax asset valuation allowance release of million  tax benefit from stock based awards of million  deferred income taxes  net of million  and accretion of discount on debt securities of million 
we also generated cash from a decrease of inventory of million  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  and other long term liabilities of million 
the cash generated was partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable of million on higher sales of our products during the period  increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
our investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december   of which we obtained million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments  and used million for the purchase of short term investments 
we used million to purchase computer equipment and research and development design tools to support our growing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these capital expenditures will be used primarily to support product development activities 
we will use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
we used million to purchase the tcam products and certain related assets from cypress semiconductor and for the aeluros acquisition 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from proceeds of stock option exercises of million  and tax benefit from stock based awards of million 
cash provided by financing activities was offset by repayment of software license and other obligations of million 
cash flows during the year ended december  during the year ended december   our operating activities generated net cash of million 
during the period  we recorded non cash items of million primarily consisting of an in process research and development charge of million related to the acquisition of the cypress nse assets  stock based compensation of million  provision for inventory reserve of million  accretion of discount on debt securities of million and depreciation and amortization of intangibles of million 
the cash generated was offset by the increase in accounts receivable of million on higher sales of our knowledge based processors during the period  an increase in inventory of million primarily due to the addition of nse products acquired from cypress and a decrease in accounts payable of million due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
our investing activities used cash of million during the year ended december   of which million was for the purchase of short term investments 
we used million to purchase computer equipment and research and development design tools to support our growing operations 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal these capital expenditures will be used primarily to support product development activities 
we will use our cash and cash equivalents to fund these purchases 
we paid approximately million for expenses directly associated with the acquisition of the nse business from cypress 
our financing activities provided net cash of million for the year ended december   primarily from stock option exercises 
cash provided by financing activities was offset by repayment of software license and other obligations 

table of contents capital resources we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balance of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of revenue we generate  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products  and any future business acquisitions that we might undertake 
however  if we do not meet our plan  we could be required  or might elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we also might decide to raise additional capital at such times and upon such terms as management considers favorable and in the interests of the company  including  but not limited to  from the sale of up to million of our debt and or equity securities before reductions for expenses  underwriting discounts and commissions under our shelf registration statement 
contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december  are summarized below in thousands total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations software license obligations wafer purchases other total in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services entered into in the normal course of business 
these obligations  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions 
other obligations shown above represent million of adverse purchase commitments for which the inventory is considered unsalable 
in addition  due to uncertainty with respect to timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note income taxes or a discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  or spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include agreements to indemnify our customers with respect to liabilities associated with the infringement of other parties technology based upon our products  obligation to indemnify our lessors under facility lease agreements  and obligation to indemnify our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the duration of such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees varies and  in certain cases  is indefinite 
we have not recorded any liability for any such indemnification obligations  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is estimable and probable 
under master purchase agreements signed with cisco in november  we have agreed to indemnify cisco for costs incurred in rectifying epidemic failures  up to the greater of on a per claim basis of all amounts paid to us by cisco during the preceding months approximately  million at december  or million  plus replacement costs 
if we are required to make payments under the indemnity  our operating results may be adversely affected
