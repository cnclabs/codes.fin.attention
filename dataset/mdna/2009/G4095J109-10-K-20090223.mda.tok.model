item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

table of contents marketing and distribution a majority of our business is sourced through reinsurance brokers 
brokerage distribution channels provide us with access to an efficient  variable cost and global distribution system without the significant time and expense that would be incurred in creating a wholly owned distribution network 
we believe that our financial strength rating  unencumbered balance sheet and superior client service are essential for creating long term relationships with clients and brokers 
we intend to build long term relationships with global reinsurance brokers and captive insurance companies located in the cayman islands 
our management team has significant relationships with most of the primary and specialty broker intermediaries in the reinsurance marketplace 
we believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers we will be able to continue to obtain access to a broad range of reinsurance clients and opportunities 
we intend to focus on the quality and financial strength of any brokerage firm with which we do business 
brokers do not have the authority to bind us to any reinsurance contract 
we review and approve all contract submissions in our corporate offices located in the cayman islands 
during  we entered into a service agreement with a specialist service provider 
under the agreement  the specialist provides administration and support in developing and maintaining relationships  reviewing and recommending programs and managing risks on certain specialty lines of business 
the service provider does not have any authority to bind the company to any reinsurance contracts 
reinsurance brokers receive a brokerage commission that is usually a percentage of gross premiums written 
we seek to become the first choice of brokers and clients by providing customized solutions that address the specific business needs of our clients  rapid and substantive responses to proposal and pricing quote requests  timely payment of claims  financial security  and clear indication of risks we will and will not underwrite 
the following table sets forth our gross premiums written by brokers for the years ended december   and in thousands name of broker access re aon ltd cornerstone re denis m clayton frontline insurance managers gallagher re guy carpenter co lainston international mgmt rib intermediaries risk insurance consulting  inc reinsurance cooperative associates  llc other total frontline insurance managers  inc is a related party of first protective insurance company  the counterparty to our largest contract bound in represents our share of gross return premiums based on updated information received from client 

table of contents we believe that by maintaining close relationships with brokers  we are able to obtain access to a broad range of potential clients 
we meet frequently in the cayman islands and elsewhere with brokers and senior representatives of clients and prospective clients 
all contract submissions are approved in our executive offices in the cayman islands 
due to our dependence on brokers  we may assume a degree of credit risk 
see risk factors the involvement of reinsurance brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in addition  we expect the large number of captive insurance companies located in the cayman islands to be a source of business for us 
we aim to develop relationships with potential clients when we believe they have a need for reinsurance  based on our industry knowledge and market trends 
we believe that diversity in our sources of business will help reduce any potential adverse effects arising out of the termination of any one of our business relationships 
underwriting and risk management we have established a senior team of generalist underwriters and actuaries to operate our reinsurance business 
we believe that their experience  coupled with our approach to underwriting  will allow us to deploy our capital in a variety of lines of business and to capitalize on opportunities that we believe offer favorable returns on equity over the long term 
our underwriters and actuaries have expertise in a number of lines of business and we will also look to outside consultants on a fee for service basis to help us with niche areas of expertise when we deem it appropriate 
we generally apply the following underwriting and risk management principles economics of results our primary goal is to build a reinsurance portfolio that has attractive economic results 
we may underwrite a reinsurance contract that may not demonstrate immediate short term accounting benefits if we believe it will provide favorable return on equity over the life of the contract 
in pricing our products  we assume investment returns which approximate the risk free rate  which we intend to review and adjust  if necessary  on an annual basis 
team approach each transaction typically is assigned to an underwriter and an actuary to evaluate underwriting  structuring and pricing 
prior to committing capital to any transaction  the evaluation team creates a deal analysis memorandum that highlights the key components of the proposed transaction and presents the proposed transaction to a senior group of staff  including underwriting  actuarial and finance 
this group  including our chief underwriting officer  must agree that the transaction meets or exceeds our return on equity requirements before we submit a firm proposal 
our chief underwriting officer maintains the exclusive ultimate authority to bind contracts 
actuarially based pricing we have developed proprietary actuarial models and also use several commercially available tools to price our business 
our models not only consider conventional underwriting metrics  but also incorporate a component for risk aversion that places greater weight on scenarios that result in greater losses 
the actuary working on the transaction must agree that the transaction meets or exceeds our return on equity requirements before we commit capital 
we price each transaction based on the merits and structure of the transaction 

table of contents act as lead underwriter typically  one reinsurer acts as the lead underwriter in negotiating principal policy terms and pricing of reinsurance contracts 
we aim to act as the lead underwriter for the majority of the aggregate premiums that we underwrite 
we believe that lead underwriting is an important factor in achieving long term success  as lead underwriters typically have greater influence in negotiating pricing  terms and conditions 
in addition  we believe that reinsurers that lead policies are generally solicited for a broader range of business and have greater access to attractive risks 
alignment of company and client s interests we seek to ensure each contract we underwrite aligns our interests with our client s interests 
specifically  we may seek to pay our clients a commission based upon a predetermined percentage of the profit we realize on the business  which we refer to as a profit commission  allow the client to perform all claims adjusting and audits  as well as the funding and paying of claims  which we refer to as self insured retentions  provide that the client pays a predetermined proportion of all losses above a predetermined amount  which we refer to as co participation  and or charge the client a premium for reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage to the full amount reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment  which we refer to as a reinstatement premium 
we believe that through profit commissions  self insured retentions  co participation  reinstatement premiums or other terms within the contract  our clients are provided with an incentive to manage our interests 
we believe that aligning our interests with our client s interests promotes accurate reporting of information  timely settling and management of claims and limits the potential for disputes 
integrated underwriting operations we have implemented a cradle to grave service philosophy where the same individual underwrites and administers the reinsurance contracts 
we believe this method enables us to best understand the risks and likelihood of loss for any particular contract and to provide superior client service 
detailed contract diligence we are highly selective in the contracts we choose to underwrite and spend a significant amount of time with our clients and brokers to understand the risks and appropriately structure the contracts 
we usually obtain significant amounts of data from our clients to conduct a thorough actuarial modeling analysis 
as part of our pricing and underwriting process  we assess among other factors the client s and industry historical loss data  the expected duration for claims to fully develop  the client s pricing and underwriting strategies  the geographic areas in which the client is doing business and its market share  the reputation and financial strength of the client  the reputation and expertise of the broker  the likelihood of establishing a long term relationship with the client and the broker  and 
table of contents reports provided by independent industry specialists 
underwriting authorities we use actuarial models that we produce and apply our underwriting guidelines to analyze each reinsurance opportunity before we commit capital 
the underwriting committee of our board of directors has set parameters for zonal and aggregate property catastrophic caps and limits for maximum loss potential under any individual contract 
the underwriting committee may approve exceptions to the established limits 
our approach to risk control imposes an absolute loss limit on our natural catastrophic exposures rather than an estimate of probable maximum losses and we have established zonal and aggregate limits 
we manage all non catastrophic exposures and other risks by analyzing our maximum loss potential on a contract by contract basis 
we believe that the maximum underwriting authorities  as set by our underwriting committee  will likely change over time as our capital base increases 
retrocessional coverage we may from time to time purchase retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons to manage our overall exposure  to reduce our net liability on individual risks  to obtain additional underwriting capacity and to balance our underwriting portfolio 
we intend to only purchase uncollateralized retrocessional coverage from a reinsurer with a minimum financial strength rating of a excellent from either am best company  inc  or am best  or an equivalent rating from standard poor s rating services 
for non rated reinsurers  we monitor and obtain collateral in the form of cash  funds withheld  or letters of credit 
as of december   the aggregate amount due from reinsurers from retrocessional coverages represents of our outstanding loss reserves 
as of december   all the reinsurers of our retrocessional coverage had either a financial strength rating from am best of a excellent or better  or we held cash collateral or letters of credit in excess of the estimated losses recoverable 
capital allocation we allocate capital to each contract that we bind 
our capital allocation methodology uses the probability and magnitude of potential for economic loss 
we allocate capital for the period until the risk is resolved 
we have developed a proprietary return on equity capital allocation model to evaluate and price each reinsurance contract that we underwrite 
we use different return on equity thresholds depending on the type and risk characteristics of the business we underwrite 
claims management we have not experienced a high volume of claims to date 
our claims management process initiates upon receipt of reports from our clients 
we have implemented a cradle to grave service philosophy where the same individual underwrites and administers the reinsurance contracts 
underwriters review claims submissions for authorization prior to entry and settlement 
we believe this ensures we pay claims consistently with the terms and conditions of each contract 
depending on the size of the claim payment  additional approvals for payment must be obtained from executive officers  which may include our chief financial officer 
where necessary  we will conduct or contract for on site audits  particularly for large accounts and for those whose performance differs from our expectations 
through these audits  we will evaluate ceding companies claims handling practices  including the organization of their claims departments  their fact finding and investigation techniques  their loss notifications  the adequacy of their reserves  their negotiation and settlement practices and their adherence to claims handling guidelines 
we recognize that fair interpretation of our reinsurance agreements with our clients and timely payment of covered claims is a valuable service to our clients 

table of contents reserves our reserving philosophy is to reserve to our best estimates of the actual results of the risks underwritten 
our actuaries and underwriters provide reserving estimates on a quarterly basis calculated to meet our estimated future obligations 
we reserve on a transaction by transaction basis 
we have engaged outside actuaries who review these estimates at least once a year 
due to the use of different assumptions  accounting treatment and loss experience  the amount we establish as reserves with respect to individual risks  transactions or classes of business may be greater or less than those established by clients or ceding companies 
reserves may also include unearned premiums  premium deposits  profit sharing earned but not yet paid  claims reported but not yet paid  claims incurred but not reported and claims in the process of settlement 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  reserves represent our estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of the claim 
although the methods for establishing reserves are well tested  some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation 
we base these estimates on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known  as well as estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors  including the actions of third parties  which are beyond our control 
collateral arrangements and letter of credit facilities we are not licensed or admitted as an insurer in any jurisdiction other than the cayman islands 
many jurisdictions such as the united states do not permit clients to take credit for reinsurance on their statutory financial statements if such reinsurance is obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers without appropriate collateral 
as a result  we anticipate that all of our us clients and a portion of our us clients will require us to provide collateral for the contracts we bind with them 
we expect this collateral to take the form of funds withheld  trust arrangements or letters of credit 
as of december   we have two separate letter of credit facilities in an aggregate maximum amount of million 
as of december   we have issued letters of credit totaling million to clients 
the failure to maintain  replace or increase our letter of credit facilities on commercially acceptable terms may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy 
see risk factors our failure to maintain sufficient letter of credit facilities or to increase our letter of credit capacity on commercially acceptable terms as we grow could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy 
competition the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major reinsurers  most of which are well established  have significant operating histories and strong financial strength ratings  and have developed long standing client relationships 
our competitors include ace limited  everest re  general re corporation  hannover re group  munich reinsurance company  partnerre ltd  swiss reinsurance company  and transatlantic reinsurance company  which are dominant companies in our industry 
although we seek to provide coverage where capacity and alternatives are limited  we directly compete with these larger companies due to the breadth of their coverage across the property and casualty market in substantially all lines of business 
we also compete with smaller companies and other niche reinsurers 
while we have a limited operating history  we believe that our approach to underwriting will allow us to be successful in underwriting transactions against more established competitors 
ratings we currently have an a excellent financial strength rating with a stable outlook from am best  which is the fourth highest of ratings 
we believe that a strong rating is an important factor in the marketing of reinsurance products to clients and brokers 
this rating reflects the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet obligations 
it is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold our class a ordinary shares 

table of contents the failure to maintain a strong rating may significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy 
see risk factors a downgrade or withdrawal of our am best rating would significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully

investment strategy dme advisors implements a value oriented investment strategy by taking long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities 
dme advisors aims to achieve high absolute rates of return while minimizing the risk of capital loss 
dme advisors attempts to determine the risk return characteristics of potential investments by analyzing factors such as the risk that expected cash flows will not be obtained  the volatility of the cash flows  the leverage of the underlying business and the security s liquidity  among others 
our board of directors conducts reviews of our investment portfolio activities and oversees our investment guidelines to meet our investment objectives 
we believe  while less predictable than traditional fixed income portfolios  our investment approach complements our reinsurance business and will achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that invest predominantly in fixed income securities 
our investment guidelines are designed to maintain adequate liquidity to fund our reinsurance operations and to protect against unexpected events 
dme advisors  which is contractually obligated to adhere to our investment guidelines  makes investment decisions on our behalf  which include buying public or private corporate equities and current pay debt securities  selling securities short and investing in trade claims  debt securities of distressed issuers  arbitrages  bank loan participations  derivatives including options  warrants  swaps and futures  commodities  currencies  leases  break ups  consolidations  reorganizations  limited partnerships and similar securities of non us issuers 
investment guidelines the investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors  which may be amended or modified from time to time take into account restrictions imposed on us by regulators  our liability mix  requirements to maintain an appropriate claims paying rating by ratings agencies and requirements of lenders 
as of the date hereof  the investment guidelines currently state quality investments at least of the assets in the investment portfolio are to be held in debt or equity securities including swaps of publicly traded companies and governments of the organization of economic co operation and development  or the oecd  high income countries and cash  cash equivalents or united states government obligations 
concentration of investments other than cash  cash equivalents and united states government obligations  no single investment in the investment portfolio may constitute more than of the portfolio 
no more than of the assets in the investment portfolio will be held in private equity securities 
liquidity assets will be invested in such fashion that we have a reasonable expectation that we can meet any of our liabilities as they become due 
we periodically review with the investment advisor the liquidity of the portfolio 
monitoring we require our investment advisor to re evaluate each position in the investment portfolio and to monitor changes in intrinsic value and trading value and provide monthly reports on the investment portfolio to us as we may reasonably determine 
leverage the investment portfolio may not employ greater than indebtedness for borrowed money  including net margin balances  for extended time periods 
the investment advisor may use  in the normal course of business  an aggregate of net margin leverage for periods of less than days

this exposure analysis does not include cash us dollar and foreign currencies  gold  credit default swaps  or interest rate options 
in addition  under this methodology  the exposure for total return swaps and futures contracts is reported at its full notional amount 
the notional amount of a derivative contract is the underlying value upon which payment obligations are computed and that we believe best represents the risk exposure 
for an equity total return swap  for example  the notional amount is the number of shares underlying the swap multiplied by the market price of those shares 
options are reported at their delta adjusted basis 
the delta of an equity option is the sensitivity of the option price to the underlying stock price 
the delta adjusted basis is the number of shares underlying the option multiplied by the delta and the underlying stock price

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors that could materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations are outlined below 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business financial position or results of operations 
risks relating to our business our results of operations will fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
the performance of our reinsurance operations and our investment portfolio will fluctuate from period to period 
fluctuations will result from a variety of factors  including reinsurance contract pricing  our assessment of the quality of available reinsurance opportunities  the volume and mix of reinsurance products we underwrite  loss experience on our reinsurance liabilities  our ability to assess and integrate our risk management strategy properly  and the performance of our investment portfolio 
in particular  we seek to underwrite products and make investments to achieve favorable return on equity over the long term 
our investment strategy to invest primarily in long and short positions in publicly traded equity and corporate debt securities  is subject to market volatility and is likely to be more volatile than traditional fixed income portfolios that are comprised primarily of investment grade bonds 
in addition  our opportunistic nature and focus on long term growth in book value will result in fluctuations in total premiums written from period to period as we concentrate on underwriting contracts that we believe will generate better long term  rather than short term  results 
accordingly  our short term results of operations may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
we are a start up operation and there is limited historical information available for investors to evaluate our performance 
we have limited operating history 
we were formed in july but we did not begin underwriting reinsurance transactions until april as a result  there is limited historical information available to help investors evaluate our performance 
in addition  in light of our limited operating history  our historical financial statements are not necessarily meaningful for evaluating the potential of our future operations 
because our underwriting and investment strategies differ from those of other participants in the property and casualty reinsurance market  you may not be able to compare our business or prospects to other property and casualty reinsurers 
established competitors with greater resources may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a profit 
the reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major reinsurers  many of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
competition in the types of business that we underwrite is based on many factors  including premium charges  the general reputation and perceived financial strength of the reinsurer  relationships with reinsurance brokers  terms and conditions of products offered  
table of contents ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payment and reputation  and the experience and reputation of the members of our underwriting team in the particular lines of reinsurance we seek to underwrite 
additionally  although the members of our underwriting team have general experience across many property and casualty lines  they may not have the requisite experience or expertise to compete for all transactions that fall within our strategy of offering customized frequency and severity contracts at times and in markets where capacity and alternatives may be limited 
our competitors include ace limited  everest re  general re corporation  hannover re group  munich reinsurance company  partner re ltd  swiss reinsurance company  and transatlantic reinsurance company  which are dominant companies in our industry 
although we seek to provide coverage where capacity and alternatives are limited  we directly compete with these larger companies due to the breadth of their coverage across the property and casualty market in substantially all lines of business 
we also compete with smaller companies and other niche reinsurers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the reinsurance market 
our failure to compete effectively would significantly and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations and may increase the likelihood that we may be deemed to be a passive foreign investment company or an investment company 
see risk factor we are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under us federal securities law 
our losses may exceed our loss reserves  which could significantly and negatively affect our business 
our results of operations and financial condition depend upon our ability to assess accurately the potential losses associated with the risks we reinsure 
reserves are estimates at a given time of claims an insurer ultimately expects to pay  based upon facts and circumstances then known  predictions of future events  estimates of future trends in claim severity and other variable factors 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating loss reserves generally are greater for reinsurance companies as compared to primary insurers  primarily due to the lapse of time from the occurrence of an event to the reporting of the claim and the ultimate resolution or settlement of the claim  the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties  and the necessary reliance on the client for information regarding claims 
as a relatively new reinsurer with a focus on being the lead underwriter on sizeable transactions and on a majority of premiums we underwrite  our estimation of reserves may be less reliable than the reserve estimations of a reinsurer with a greater volume of business of smaller transactions and an established loss history 
actual losses and loss adjustment expenses paid may deviate substantially from the estimates of our loss reserves contained in our financial statements  to our detriment 
if we determine our loss reserves to be inadequate  we will increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which we identify the deficiency  and such a reduction would negatively affect our results of operations 
if our losses greatly exceed our loss reserves  our financial condition may be significantly and negatively affected 
the property and casualty reinsurance market may be affected by cyclical trends 
we write reinsurance in the property and casualty markets 
the property and casualty reinsurance industry is cyclical 
primary insurers underwriting results  prevailing general economic and market conditions  liability retention decisions of companies and primary insurers and reinsurance premium rates influence the demand for property and casualty reinsurance 
prevailing prices and available surplus to support assumed business influence reinsurance supply 
supply may fluctuate in response to changes in 
table of contents rates of return on investments realized in the reinsurance industry  the frequency and severity of losses and prevailing general economic and market conditions 
continued increases in the supply of reinsurance may have consequences for the reinsurance industry generally and for us  including lower premium rates  increased expenses for customer acquisition and retention and less favorable policy terms and conditions 
unpredictable developments  including courts granting increasingly larger awards for certain damages  natural disasters such as catastrophic hurricanes  windstorms  tornados  earthquakes and floods  fluctuations in interest rates  changes in the investment environment that affect market prices of investments and inflationary pressures  affect the industry s profitability 
the effects of cyclicality could significantly and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a recession and other adverse consequences of the recent us and global economic and financial industry downturns could harm our business  our liquidity and financial condition  and our stock price 
global market and economic conditions have been severely disrupted 
these conditions may potentially affect among other aspects of our business the demand for and claims made under our products  the ability of customers  counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us  our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources and our investment performance 
continued volatility in the us and other securities markets may adversely affect our stock price 
a downgrade or withdrawal of our am best rating would significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
companies  insurers and reinsurance brokers use ratings from independent ratings agencies as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of reinsurers 
am best has assigned us a financial strength rating of a excellent  which is the fourth highest of ratings that am best issues 
this rating reflects the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet obligations 
it is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy  sell or hold our class a ordinary shares 
am best periodically reviews our rating and may revise it downward or revoke it at its sole discretion based primarily on its analysis of our balance sheet strength  operating performance and business profile 
factors which may affect such an analysis include if we change our business practices from our organizational business plan in a manner that no longer supports am best s rating  if unfavorable financial or market trends impact us  if our losses significantly exceed our loss reserves  if we are unable to retain our senior management and other key personnel  or if our investment portfolio incurs significant losses 
if am best downgrades or withdraws our rating  we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any new reinsurance contracts  which would significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy 
certain of our reinsurance contracts provide the client with the right to terminate the agreement if our a excellent am best rating is downgraded below certain rating thresholds 
we expect that similar provisions will be included in certain future contracts as well 
a significant decrease in our capital or surplus could enable certain clients to terminate reinsurance agreements or to require additional collateral 
certain of our assumed reinsurance contracts contain provisions that permit our clients to cancel the contract or require additional collateral in the event of a downgrade in our ratings below specified levels or a reduction of our capital or surplus below specified levels over the course of the agreement 
whether a client would exercise such cancellation rights would likely depend  among other things  on the reason the provision is triggered  the prevailing market conditions  the degree of unexpired coverage and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage 
if any such provisions were to become exercisable  we cannot predict whether or how many of our clients would actually exercise such rights or the extent to which they would have a significant and negative effect on our financial condition  results of operations or future prospects but they could have a significant adverse effect on the operations of our company 
if we lose or are unable to retain our senior management and other key personnel and are unable to attract qualified personnel  our ability to implement our business strategy could be delayed or hindered  which  in turn  could significantly and negatively affect our business 

table of contents our future success depends to a significant extent on the efforts of our senior management and other key personnel to implement our business strategy 
we believe there are only a limited number of available  qualified executives with substantial experience in our industry 
in addition  we will need to add personnel  including underwriters  to implement our business strategy 
we could face challenges attracting personnel to the cayman islands 
accordingly  the loss of the services of one or more of the members of our senior management or other key personnel  or our inability to hire and retain other key personnel  could delay or prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy and  consequently  significantly and negatively affect our business 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance with respect to any of our senior management  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or chief underwriting officer 
if any member of senior management dies or becomes incapacitated  or leaves the company to pursue employment opportunities elsewhere  we would be solely responsible for locating an adequate replacement for such senior management and for bearing any related cost 
to the extent that we are unable to locate an adequate replacement or are unable to do so within a reasonable period of time  our business may be significantly and negatively affected 
our ability to implement our business strategy could be delayed or adversely affected by cayman islands employment restrictions 
under cayman islands law  persons who are not caymanian  do not possess caymanian status  or are not otherwise entitled to reside and work in the cayman islands pursuant to provisions of the immigration law revision of the cayman islands  which we refer to as the immigration law  may not engage in any gainful occupation in the cayman islands without an appropriate governmental work permit 
such a work permit may be granted or extended on a continuous basis for a maximum period of seven years unless the employee is deemed to be exempted from such requirement in accordance with the provisions of the immigration law  in which case such period may be extended to nine years and the employee is given the opportunity to apply for permanent residence upon showing that  after proper public advertisement  no caymanian or person of caymanian status  or other person legally and ordinarily resident in the cayman islands who meets the minimum standards for the advertised position is available 
the failure of these work permits to be granted or extended could delay us from fully implementing our business strategy 
operational risks  including human or systems failures  are inherent in our business 
operational risks and losses can result from  among other things  fraud  errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements  information technology failures or external events 
we believe that our modeling  underwriting and information technology and application systems are critical to our business 
moreover  our information technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
a major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could result in management distraction  harm our reputation or increase expenses 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls  information technology and application systems  but internal controls provide only a reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our failure to maintain sufficient letter of credit facilities or to increase our letter of credit capacity on commercially acceptable terms as we grow could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy 

table of contents we are not licensed or admitted as a reinsurer in any jurisdiction other than the cayman islands 
certain jurisdictions  including the united states  do not permit insurance companies to take credit for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers on their statutory financial statements unless appropriate security measures are implemented 
consequently  certain clients will require us to obtain a letter of credit or provide other collateral through funds withheld or trust arrangements 
when we obtain a letter of credit facility  we are customarily required to provide collateral to the letter of credit provider in order to secure our obligations under the facility 
our ability to provide collateral  and the costs at which we provide collateral  are primarily dependent on the composition of our investment portfolio 
typically  letters of credit are collateralized with fixed income securities 
banks may be willing to accept our investment portfolio as collateral  but on terms that may be less favorable to us than reinsurance companies that invest solely or predominantly in fixed income securities 
the inability to renew  maintain or obtain letters of credit collateralized by our investment portfolio may significantly limit the amount of reinsurance we can write or require us to modify our investment strategy 
as of december   we had letter of credit facilities in a maximum amount of million  of which million had been issued 
our banks have accepted  with certain restrictions  our investment portfolio as collateral 
in the event of a decline in the market value of our investment portfolio that results in a collateral shortfall  as defined in the letter of credit facility  we have the right  at our option  to reduce the outstanding obligations under the letter of credit facility  to deposit additional collateral or to change the collateral composition in order to cure the shortfall 
if the shortfall is not cured within the prescribed time period  an event of default will immediately occur 
we will be prohibited from issuing additional letters of credit until any shortfall is cured 
our access to funds under existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time  and we might be forced to replace credit sources in a difficult market 
there has also been recent consolidation in the financial industry  which could lead to increased reliance on and exposure to particular institutions 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms  or at all  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings 
if one or more of our ratings were downgraded  we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
our inability to obtain adequate capital could have a significant and negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need additional letter of credit capacity as we grow  and if we are unable to renew  maintain or increase our letter of credit facility or are unable to do so on commercially acceptable terms we may need to liquidate all or a portion of our investment portfolio and invest in a fixed income portfolio or other forms of investment acceptable to our clients and banks as collateral  which could significantly and negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy 
the inability to obtain business provided from brokers could adversely affect our business strategy and results of operations 
substantially all of our business is primarily placed through brokered transactions  which involve a limited number of reinsurance brokers 
since we began underwriting operations in april  we have placed substantially all of our premiums written through brokers 
to lose or fail to expand all or a substantial portion of the brokered business provided through one or more of these brokers  many of whom may not be familiar with our cayman islands jurisdiction  could significantly and negatively affect our business and results of operations 
we may need additional capital in the future in order to operate our business  and such capital may not be available to us or may not be available to us on favorable terms 

table of contents we may need to raise additional capital in the future through public or private equity or debt offerings or otherwise in order to fund liquidity needs caused by underwriting or investment losses  replace capital lost in the event of significant reinsurance losses or adverse reserve developments or significant investment losses  satisfy letters of credit or guarantee bond requirements that may be imposed by our clients or by regulators  meet applicable statutory jurisdiction requirements  meet rating agency capital requirements  or respond to competitive pressures 
markets in the united states and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than months  due in part to financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system and the financial markets generally 
in recent months  this volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
these circumstances have also exerted downward pressure on stock prices and reduced access to the equity and debt markets for many issuers  including us 
this unprecedented market volatility and general decline in the markets has affected our investment portfolio  results of operations  and may reduce our access to capital and may increase the cost of capital 
additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
further  any additional capital raised through the sale of equity could dilute your ownership interest in our company and may cause the market price of our class a ordinary shares to decline 
additional capital raised through the issuance of debt may result in creditors having rights  preferences and privileges senior or otherwise superior to those of our class a ordinary shares 
our property and property catastrophe reinsurance operations may make us vulnerable to losses from catastrophes and may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from period to period 
our reinsurance operations expose us to claims arising out of unpredictable catastrophic events  such as hurricanes  hailstorms  tornados  windstorms  severe winter weather  earthquakes  floods  fires  explosions  volcanic eruptions and other natural or man made disasters 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable but the loss experience of property catastrophe reinsurers has been generally characterized as low frequency and high severity 
claims from catastrophic events could reduce our earnings and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year and adversely affect our financial condition 
corresponding reductions in our surplus levels could impact our ability to write new reinsurance policies 
catastrophic losses are a function of the insured exposure in the affected area and the severity of the event 
because accounting regulations do not permit reinsurers to reserve for catastrophic events until they occur  claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could significantly and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on our clients evaluations of the risks associated with their insurance underwriting  which may subject us to reinsurance losses 
in some of our proportional reinsurance business  in which we assume an agreed percentage of each underlying insurance contract being reinsured  or quota share contracts  we do not expect to separately evaluate each of the original individual risks assumed under these reinsurance contracts 
therefore  we will be largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies 
we will be subject to the risk that the clients may not have adequately evaluated the insured risks and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
we also do not expect to separately evaluate 
table of contents each of the individual claims made on the underlying insurance contracts under quota share contracts 
therefore  we will be dependent on the original claims decisions made by our clients 
we could face unanticipated losses from war  terrorism and political instability  and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have exposure to large  unexpected losses resulting from man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable and recent events may indicate an increased frequency and severity of losses 
it is difficult to predict the timing of these events or to estimate the amount of loss that any given occurrence will generate 
to the extent that losses from these risks occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly and negatively affected 
the involvement of reinsurance brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our policies to reinsurance brokers  and these brokers  in turn  remit these amounts to the ceding companies that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with us 
in some jurisdictions  if a broker fails to make such a payment  we might remain liable to the client for the deficiency notwithstanding the broker s obligation to make such payment 
conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when the client pays premiums for policies to reinsurance brokers for payment to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and the client will no longer be liable to us for these premiums  whether or not we have actually received them 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world 
we may be unable to purchase reinsurance for the liabilities we reinsure  and if we successfully purchase such reinsurance  we may be unable to collect  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for the year ended december   we had purchased million in reinsurance for the liabilities we reinsure  which we refer to as retrocessional coverage 
from time to time  we may purchase retrocessional coverage for our own account in order to mitigate the effect of a potential concentration of losses upon our financial condition 
the insolvency or inability or refusal of a retrocessionaire to make payments under the terms of its agreement with us could have an adverse effect on us because we remain liable to our client 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of retrocessional coverage that they consider adequate for their business needs 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional coverage or negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain retrocessional coverage from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness 
our failure to establish adequate retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could significantly and negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currency fluctuations could result in exchange rate losses and negatively impact our business 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
however  we expect that we will write a portion of our business and receive premiums in currencies other than the us dollar 
in addition  dme advisors may invest a portion of our portfolio in securities or cash denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  we may experience exchange rate losses to the extent our foreign currency exposure is not hedged or is not sufficiently hedged  which could significantly and negatively affect our business 
if we do seek to hedge our foreign currency exposure through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts or currency swaps  we will be subject to the risk that our counterparties to the arrangements fail to perform 
there are differences under cayman islands corporate law and delaware corporate law with respect to interested party transactions which may benefit certain of our shareholders at the expense of other shareholders 

table of contents under cayman islands corporate law  a director may vote on a contract or transaction where the director has an interest as a shareholder  director  officer or employee provided such interest is disclosed 
none of our contracts will be deemed to be void because any director is an interested party in such transaction and interested parties will not be held liable for monies owed to the company 
under delaware law  interested party transactions are voidable 
risks relating to insurance and other regulations any suspension or revocation of our reinsurance license would materially impact our ability to do business and implement our business strategy 
we are licensed as a reinsurer only in the cayman islands 
the suspension or revocation of our license to do business as a reinsurance company in the cayman islands for any reason would mean that we would not be able to enter into any new reinsurance contracts until the suspension ended or we became licensed in another jurisdiction 
any such suspension or revocation of our license would negatively impact our reputation in the reinsurance marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the cayman island monetary authority  or cima  which is the regulating authority of the cayman islands  may take a number of actions  including suspending or revoking a reinsurance license whenever cima believes that a licensee is or may become unable to meet its obligations  is carrying on business in a manner likely to be detrimental to the public interest or to the interest of its creditors or policyholders  has contravened the terms of the law  or has otherwise behaved in such a manner so as to cause cima to call into question the licensee s fitness 
further cima may revoke our license if we cease to carry on reinsurance business  the direction and management of our reinsurance business has not been conducted in a fit and proper manner  a person holding a position as a director  manager or officer is not a fit and proper person to hold the respective position  or we become bankrupt or go into liquidation or we are wound up or otherwise dissolved 
in addition  cima could revoke or suspend our license if we are deemed to be a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  or an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended  or the investment company act 
similarly  if cima suspended or revoked our license  we could lose our exemption under the investment company act 
we are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under us federal securities law 
the investment company act regulates certain companies that invest in or trade securities 
we rely on an exemption under the investment company act for an entity organized and regulated as a foreign insurance company which is engaged primarily and predominantly in the reinsurance of risks on insurance agreements 
the law in this area is subjective and there is a lack of guidance as to the meaning of primarily and predominantly under the relevant exemption to the investment company act 
for example  there is no standard for the amount of premiums that need to be written relative to the level of an entity s capital in order to qualify for the exemption 
if this exemption were deemed inapplicable  we would have to register under the investment company act as an investment company 
registered investment companies are subject to extensive  restrictive and potentially adverse regulation relating to  among other things  operating methods  management  capital structure  leverage  dividends and transactions with affiliates 
registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we operate our business  nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that we have with our affiliated companies 
accordingly  we likely would not be permitted to 
table of contents engage dme advisors as our investment advisor  unless we obtained board and shareholder approvals under the investment company act 
if dme advisors were not our investment advisor  dme advisors would liquidate our investment portfolio and we would seek to identify and retain another investment advisor with a value oriented investment philosophy 
if we could not identify or retain such an advisor  we would be required to make substantial modifications to our investment strategy 
any such changes to our investment strategy could significantly and negatively impact our investment results  financial condition and our ability to implement our business strategy 
if at any time it were established that we had been operating as an investment company in violation of the registration requirements of the investment company act  there would be a risk  among other material adverse consequences  that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief  or both  that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which it was established that we were an unregistered investment company 
to the extent that the laws and regulations change in the future so that contracts we write are deemed not to be reinsurance contracts  we will be at greater risk of not qualifying for the investment company act exception 
additionally  it is possible that our classification as an investment company would result in the suspension or revocation of our reinsurance license 
insurance regulators in the united states or elsewhere may review our activities and claim that we are subject to that jurisdiction s licensing requirements 
we do not presently expect that we will be admitted to do business in any jurisdiction other than the cayman islands 
in general  the cayman islands insurance statutes  regulations and the policies of cima are less restrictive than united states state insurance statutes and regulations 
we cannot assure you  however  that insurance regulators in the united states  the united kingdom or elsewhere will not review our activities and claim that we are subject to such jurisdiction s licensing requirements 
in addition  we are subject to indirect regulatory requirements imposed by jurisdictions that may limit our ability to provide reinsurance 
for example  our ability to write reinsurance may be subject  in certain cases  to arrangements satisfactory to applicable regulatory bodies and proposed legislation and regulations may have the effect of imposing additional requirements upon  or restricting the market for  non us reinsurers such as us with whom domestic companies may place business 
we do not know of any such proposed legislation pending at this time 
if in the future we were to become subject to the laws or regulations of any state in the united states or to the laws of the united states  the united kingdom or of any other country  we may consider various alternatives to our operations 
if we choose to attempt to become licensed in another jurisdiction  for instance  we may not be able to do so and the modification of the conduct of our business or the non compliance with insurance statutes and regulations could significantly and negatively affect our business 
current legal and regulatory activities relating to certain insurance products could affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the sale and purchase of products that may be structured in such a way so as to not contain sufficient risk transfer to meet the requirement of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts to be accounted for as reinsurance  or loss mitigation insurance products  have become the focus of investigations by the sec and numerous state attorneys general 
although we seek to use structured contractual features in our product offerings  we conduct both internal and external accounting analyses with respect to risk transfer and believe that to date all of our contracts contain sufficient risk transfer under sfas to be accounted for as reinsurance 
however  because some of our contracts contain or will contain features designed to manage the overall risks we assume  such as a cap on potential losses or a refund of some portion of the premium if we incur smaller losses than anticipated at the time the contract is entered into  it is possible that we may become subject to the ongoing inquiries into loss mitigation products conducted by 
table of contents the sec or certain attorney generals 
in addition  we cannot predict at this time what effect the current investigations  litigation and regulatory activity will have on the reinsurance industry or our business or what  if any  changes may be made to laws and regulations regarding the industry and financial reporting 
it is possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments will mandate changes in industry practices that will negatively impact our ability to use certain loss mitigation features in our products and  accordingly  our ability to operate our business pursuant to our existing strategy 
moreover  any reclassification of our reinsurance contracts as deposit liabilities rather than reinsurance contacts could call into question our exception under the investment company act 
the outcome of recent industry investigations and regulatory proposals could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our shares to be volatile 
the insurance industry has attracted increased scrutiny by regulatory and law enforcement authorities relating to allegations of improper special payments  price fixing  bid rigging  improper accounting practices and other alleged misconduct 
formal and informal inquiries have been made of a large segment of the industry  and a number of companies in the insurance industry have received subpoenas  requests for information from regulatory agencies or other inquiries relating to these and similar matters 
these efforts have resulted in both enforcement actions and proposals for new regulation 
although some of these enforcement actions have been settled and we are not subject to the united states regulatory regime  we cannot predict the outcome of this increased regulatory scrutiny or whether it will expand into other areas  whether activities and practices currently thought to be lawful will be characterized as unlawful  what form new regulations will have when finally adopted or the impact  if any  of increased regulatory and law enforcement action on our business and results of operations 
risks relating to our investment strategy and our investment advisor we have limited control as to how our investment portfolio is allocated and its performance depends on the ability of dme advisors to select and manage appropriate investments 
dme advisors acts as our exclusive investment advisor for our investment portfolio and recommends appropriate investment opportunities 
although dme advisors is contractually obligated to follow our investment guidelines  we cannot assure shareholders as to how assets will be allocated to different investment opportunities  including long and short positions and derivatives trading  which could increase the level of risk to which our investment portfolio will be exposed 
in addition  dme advisors can outsource to sub advisors without our consent or approval 
the performance of our investment portfolio depends to a great extent on the ability of dme advisors to select and manage appropriate investments 
our advisory agreement with dme advisors terminates on december   unless extended  and we have limited ability to terminate the advisory agreement earlier 
we cannot assure you that dme advisors will be successful in meeting our investment objectives or that the advisory agreement with dme advisors will be renewed 
the failure of dme advisors to perform adequately could significantly and negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend upon dme advisors to implement our investment strategy 
we depend upon dme advisors to implement our investment strategy 
accordingly  the diminution or loss of the services of dme advisors could significantly affect our business 
the loss of dme advisors principals or other key personnel  or dme advisors inability to hire and retain other key personnel  over which we have no control  could delay or prevent dme advisors from fully implementing our investment strategy on our behalf  and consequently  could significantly and negatively affect our business 
the advisory agreement requires that we utilize the advisory services of dme advisors exclusively until december  subject to limited termination provisions  even if the performance of our investment portfolio is below our expectations 
our investment performance may suffer as a result of adverse capital market developments or other factors that impact our liquidity  which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may derive a significant portion of our income from our investment portfolio 
as a result  our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio 
we strive to structure our investments in a manner that recognizes our liquidity needs for future liabilities 
we cannot assure you that dme advisors will successfully structure our investments in relation to our anticipated liabilities 
failure to do so could force us to liquidate investments at a significant loss or at prices that are not optimal  which could significantly and adversely affect our financial results 
our investment income loss for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million  respectively  compared to total revenue of million  million  and million  respectively 
the risks associated with dme advisors value oriented investment strategy may be substantially greater than the risks associated with traditional fixed income investment strategies 
in addition  making long equity investments in an up or rising market may increase the risk of not generating profits on these investments and we may incur losses if the market declines 
similarly  making short equity investments in a down or falling market may increase the risk of not generating profits on these investments and we may incur losses if the market rises 
the market price of the class a ordinary shares may be volatile and the risk of loss may be greater when compared with other reinsurance companies 
the success of our investment strategy may also be affected by general economic conditions 
unexpected market volatility and illiquidity associated with our investments could significantly and negatively affect our investment portfolio results 
deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to additional investment losses 
the prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including among other things  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions  have resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
for the year ended december   we incurred net investment losses of million 
we continue to closely monitor current market conditions and evaluate the long term impact of this recent market volatility on all of our investment holdings 
depending on market conditions  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have a significant and negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business 
in addition  our reinsurers and retrocessionaires may be affected by such developments in the financial markets  which could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
potential conflicts of interest with dme advisors may exist that could adversely affect us 
none of dme advisors and its principals  including david einhorn  chairman of our board of directors  and the president of greenlight capital  inc  are obligated to devote any specific amount of time to the affairs of our company 
affiliates of dme advisors  including greenlight capital  inc  manage and expect to continue to manage other client accounts  some of which have objectives similar to ours  including collective investment vehicles managed by dme advisors affiliates and in which dme advisors or its affiliates may have an equity interest 
pursuant to our advisory agreement with dme advisors  dme advisors has the exclusive right to manage our investment portfolio and is required to follow our investment guidelines and act in a manner that is fair and equitable in allocating investment opportunities to us  but the agreement does not otherwise impose any specific obligations or requirements concerning allocation of time  effort or investment opportunities to us or any restriction on the nature or timing of investments for our account and for dme advisors own account or other accounts that dme advisors or its affiliates may manage 
if we compete for any investment opportunity with another entity that dme 
table of contents advisors or its affiliates manage  dme advisors is not required to afford us any exclusivity or priority 
dme advisors interest and the interests of its affiliates  including greenlight capital  inc  may at times conflict  possibly to dme advisors detriment  which may potentially adversely affect our investment opportunities and returns 
although mr 
einhorn  chairman of our board of directors  recused himself from the vote approving and adopting our investment guidelines  he is not  under cayman islands law  legally restricted from participating in making decisions with respect to our investment guidelines 
accordingly  his involvement as a member of our board of directors may lead to a conflict of interest 
dme advisors and its affiliates may also manage accounts whose advisory fee schedules  investment objectives and policies differ from ours  which may cause dme advisors and its affiliates to effect trading in one account that may have an adverse effect on another account  including ours 
we are not entitled to inspect the trading records of dme advisors  or its principals  that are not related to our company 
our investment portfolio may be concentrated in a few large positions which could result in large losses 
our investment guidelines provide that dme advisors may commit up to of our assets under management to any one investment 
accordingly  from time to time we may hold a few  relatively large security positions in relation to our capital 
as of december   we were invested in approximately equity securities and the top five long and short positions in equity securities comprised an aggregate of and respectively  of our investment portfolio 
since our investment portfolio may not be widely diversified  it may be subject to more rapid changes in value than would be the case if the investment portfolio were required to maintain a wide diversification among companies  securities and types of securities 
we are exposed to credit risk primarily from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to us 
we are exposed to credit risk primarily from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to us 
the amount of the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of our financial assets 
in addition  we hold the securities of our investment portfolio with several prime brokers and have credit risk from the possibility that one or more of them may default on their obligations to us 
other than our investment in derivative contracts and corporate debt  if any  and the fact that our investments are held by prime brokers on our behalf  we have no significant concentrations of credit risk 
issuers or borrowers whose securities or debt we hold  customers  reinsurers  clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  insolvency  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure  fraud or other reasons 
such defaults could have a significant and negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
additionally  the underlying assets supporting our financial contracts may deteriorate causing these securities to incur losses 
dme advisors may trade on margin and use other forms of financial leverage  which could potentially adversely affect our revenues 
our investment guidelines provide dme advisors with the ability to trade on margin and use other forms of financial leverage 
fluctuations in the market value of our investment portfolio could have a disproportionately large effect in relation to our capital 
any event which may adversely affect the value of positions we hold could significantly negatively affect the net asset value of our investment portfolio and thus our results of operations 
dme advisors may effectuate short sales that subject us to unlimited loss potential 

table of contents dme advisors may enter into transactions in which it sells a security it does not own  which we refer to as a short sale  in anticipation of a decline in the market value of the security 
short sales for our account theoretically will involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase 
under adverse market conditions  dme advisors might have difficulty purchasing securities to meet short sale delivery obligations and may have to cover shorts sales at suboptimal prices 
the loss by dme advisors of key employees could materially adversely affect our investment results 
dme advisors  and consequently our investment portfolio  is dependent on the talents  efforts and leadership of dme advisors principals 
the diminution or loss of the services of dme advisors principals  or diminution or loss of their reputation and integrity or any negative market or industry perception arising from that diminution or loss  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our advisory agreement with dme advisors does not allow us to terminate the agreement in the event that dme advisors loses any or all of its principals 
dme advisors may transact in derivative instruments  which may increase the risk of our investment portfolio 
derivative instruments  or derivatives  include futures  options  swaps  structured securities and other instruments and contracts that derive their value from one or more underlying securities  financial benchmarks  currencies  commodities or indices 
there are a number of risks associated with derivatives trading 
because many derivatives are leveraged  and thus provide significantly more market exposure than the money paid or deposited when the transaction is entered into  a relatively small adverse market movement may result in the loss of a substantial portion of or the entire investment  and may potentially expose us to a loss exceeding the original amount invested 
derivatives may also expose us to liquidity and counterparty risk 
there may not be a liquid market within which to close or dispose of outstanding derivatives contracts 
in the event of the counterparty s default  we will generally only rank as an unsecured creditor and risk the loss of all or a portion of the amounts we are contractually entitled to receive 
the compensation arrangements of dme advisors may create an incentive to effect transactions that are risky or speculative 
dme advisors is entitled to two forms of compensation under the advisory agreement a annual management fee  regardless of the performance of our investment account  payable monthly based on net assets of our investment account  excluding assets  if any  held in regulation trusts  and performance compensation based on the appreciation in the value of our investment account equal to of net profits calculated per annum  subject to a loss carryforward provision 
while the performance compensation arrangement provides that losses will be carried forward as an offset against net profits in subsequent periods  dme advisors generally will not otherwise be penalized for realized losses or decreases in the value of our portfolio 
these performance compensation arrangements may create an incentive for dme advisors to engage in transactions that focus on the potential for short term gains rather than long term growth or that are particularly risky or speculative 
dme advisors representatives service on boards and committees may place trading restrictions on our investments and may subject us to indemnification liability 
dme advisors may from time to time place its or its affiliates representatives on creditors committees and or boards of certain companies in which we have invested 
while such representation may enable dme advisors to enhance the sale value of our investments  it may also place trading restrictions on our investments and may subject us to indemnification liability 
the advisory agreement provides for the indemnification of dme advisors or any other person designated by dme advisors for claims arising from such board representation 

table of contents from march  until march   david einhorn  the chairman of our board of directors  was a director of new century financial corp  or new century  a subprime mortgage lender that filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on april  each of new century s directors  including mr 
einhorn  has been named as a defendant in a consolidated shareholder lawsuit 
if mr 
einhorn were held liable with respect to any claims relating to or arising out of new century s bankruptcy filing or the shareholder lawsuit  and if such claims were not fully covered by new century s director and officer insurance coverage or indemnification by new century  then under the advisory agreement we may have to indemnify him for certain losses arising from such claims 
we do not believe that our indemnification obligations  if any  relating to mr 
einhorn s former membership on the board of directors of new century would have a material adverse effect on our business 
as of december   representatives of dme advisors sat on the board of directors of each of biofuel energy corp 
and einstein noah restaurant group  both of whose securities are publicly traded 
additionally  as of december   representatives of dme advisors sat on the board of directors of ark real estate partners lp  a privately held company 
as of december   our portfolio included investments in each of biofuel energy corp  einstein noah restaurant group and ark real estate partners lp 
the ability to use soft dollars may provide dme advisors with an incentive to select certain brokers that may take into account benefits to be received by dme advisors 
dme advisors is entitled to use so called soft dollars generated by commissions paid in connection with transactions for our investment portfolio to pay for certain of dme advisors operating and overhead costs  including the payment of all or a portion of its costs and expenses of operation 
soft dollars are a means of paying brokerage firms for their services through commission revenue  rather than through direct payments 
dme advisors right to use soft dollars may give dme advisors an incentive to select brokers or dealers for our transactions  or to negotiate commission rates or other execution terms  in a manner that takes into account the soft dollar benefits received by dme advisors rather than giving exclusive consideration to the interests of our investment portfolio and  accordingly  may create a conflict 
the advisory agreement has limited termination provisions 
the advisory agreement has limited termination provisions which restrict our ability to manage our investment portfolio outside of dme advisors 
because the advisory agreement contains exclusivity and limited termination provisions  we are unable to use investment managers other than dme advisors for so long as the agreement is in effect 
the advisory agreement term is january  through december  and will automatically renew for successive three year terms unless we or dme advisors notify the other party at least days prior to the end of the current term of its desire to terminate 
we may terminate the advisory agreement prior to the expiration of its term only for cause  which is defined as a material violation of applicable law relating to dme advisors advisory business  dme advisors gross negligence  willful misconduct or reckless disregard of its obligations under the advisory agreement  a material breach by dme advisors of our investment guidelines that is not cured within a day period  or a material breach by dme advisors of its obligations to return and deliver assets as we may request 
if we become dissatisfied with the results of the investment performance of dme advisors  we will be unable to hire new investment managers until the advisory agreement expires by its terms or is terminated for cause 

table of contents certain of our investments may have limited liquidity and lack valuation data  which could create a conflict of interest 
our investment guidelines provide dme advisors with the flexibility to invest in certain securities with limited liquidity or no public market 
this lack of liquidity may adversely affect the ability of dme advisors to execute trade orders at desired prices and may impact our ability to fulfill our payment obligations 
to the extent that dme advisors invests in securities or instruments for which market quotations are not readily available  under the terms of the advisory agreement the valuation of such securities and instruments for purposes of compensation to dme advisors will be determined by dme advisors  whose determination  subject to audit verification  will be conclusive and binding in the absence of bad faith or manifest error 
because the advisory agreement gives dme advisors the power to determine the value of securities with no readily discernable market value  and because the calculation of dme advisors fee is based on the value of the investment account  a conflict may exist or arise 
increased regulation or scrutiny of alternative investment advisors may affect dme advisors ability to manage our investment portfolio or affect our business reputation 
non traditional investment advisors that pursue investment strategies like ours  which involve the shorting of securities and the use of derivatives and leverage to enhance returns and which we refer to as alternative investment strategies  have recently come under increased scrutiny by regulatory officials and have been the subject of proposals for new regulation and oversight 
in  the sec considered stricter oversight of the alternative investment industry 
effective february   the sec adopted a new rule under the investment advisers act of to require certain unregistered investment advisors to register with the sec 
in june  a federal court of appeals vacated the sec s rule  but we cannot assure you that other legislation or regulations will not be proposed and enacted 
it is possible that increased regulation of alternative investment advisors would adversely impact dme advisors ability to manage our investment portfolio or its ability to manage our portfolio pursuant to our existing investment strategy  which could cause us to alter our existing investment strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  adverse publicity regarding alternative investment strategies generally  or dme advisors or its affiliates specifically  could negatively affect our business reputation and attractiveness as a counterparty to brokers and clients 
during  the sec and regulators in other countries imposed certain restrictions on shorting of securities for an extended period of time 
we cannot provide any assurance that regulators will not impose the same or similar restrictions in the future 
such restrictions  if imposed again  could have a material negative impact on our ability to carry out our business strategy 
we may invest in securities based outside the united states which may be riskier than securities of united states issuers 
under our investment guidelines  dme advisors may invest in securities of issuers organized or based outside the united states 
these investments may be subject to a variety of risks and other special considerations not affecting securities of us issuers 
many foreign securities markets are not as developed or efficient as those in the united states 
securities of some foreign issuers are less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable us issuers 
similarly  volume and liquidity in many foreign securities markets are less than in the united states and  at times  price volatility can be greater than in the united states 
non us issuers may be subject to less stringent financial reporting and informational disclosure standards  practices and requirements than those applicable to us issuers 
dme advisors is entitled to receive management fees regardless of the performance of our investment portfolio 
pursuant to the advisory agreement with dme advisors  we are obligated to pay dme advisors 
table of contents a annual management fee  regardless of the performance of our investment account  payable monthly based on net assets of our investment account  excluding assets  if any  held in regulation trusts  and performance compensation based on the appreciation in the value of our investment account equal to of net profits calculated per annum  subject to a loss carryforward provision 
the loss carryforward provision allows dme advisors to earn reduced incentive compensation of of profits in any year subsequent to the year in which our investment account managed by dme advisors incurs a loss  until all losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to of the loss is earned 
risks relating to our class a ordinary shares a shareholder may be required to sell its class a ordinary shares 
our third amended and restated memorandum and articles of association  or articles  provide that we have the option  but not the obligation  to require a shareholder to sell its class a ordinary shares for their fair market value to us  to other shareholders or to third parties if our board of directors determines that ownership of our class a ordinary shares by such shareholder may result in adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders and that such sale is necessary to avoid or cure such adverse consequences 
provisions of our articles  the companies law of the cayman islands and our corporate structure may each impede a takeover  which could adversely affect the value of our class a ordinary shares 
our articles contain certain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our articles provide that a director may only be removed for cause as defined in the articles  upon the affirmative vote of not less than of our issued and outstanding class a ordinary shares 
our articles permit our board of directors to issue preferred shares from time to time  with such rights and preferences as they consider appropriate 
our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions and under circumstances that could have an effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction  deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their class a ordinary shares in the event of a tender or other offer for class a ordinary shares and have a depressive effect on the market price of the class a ordinary shares 
unlike many jurisdictions in the united states  cayman islands law does not provide for mergers as that term is understood under corporate law in the united states 
cayman islands law does have statutory provisions that provide for the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies  which are commonly referred to in the cayman islands as schemes of arrangement 
the procedural and legal requirements necessary to consummate these transactions are more rigorous and take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the united states 
under cayman islands law and practice  a scheme of arrangement in relation to a cayman islands company must be approved at a shareholders meeting by each class of shareholders  in each case  by a majority of the number of holders of each class of an entity s shares that are present and voting  either in person or by proxy  at such a meeting  which holders must also represent in value of such class issued that are present and voting  either in person or by proxy  at such meeting  excluding the shares owned by the parties to the scheme of arrangement 
the convening of these meetings and the terms of the amalgamation must also be sanctioned by the grand court of the cayman islands 
although there is no requirement to seek the consent of the creditors of the parties involved in the scheme of arrangement  the grand court typically seeks to ensure that the creditors have consented to the transfer of their liabilities to the surviving entity or that the scheme of arrangement does not otherwise materially adversely affect the creditors interests 
furthermore  the grand court will only approve a scheme of arrangement if it is satisfied that 
table of contents the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with  the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question  the scheme of arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve  and the scheme of arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the companies law 
in addition  david einhorn  chairman of our board of directors  owns all of the outstanding class b ordinary shares 
as a result  we will not be able to enter into a scheme of arrangement without the approval of mr 
einhorn as the holder of our class b ordinary shares 
holders of class a ordinary shares may have difficulty obtaining or enforcing a judgment against us  and they may face difficulties in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law 
because we are a cayman islands company  there is uncertainty as to whether the grand court of the cayman islands would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof  or be competent to hear original actions brought in the cayman islands against us predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof 
we are incorporated as an exempted company limited by shares under the companies law 
a significant amount of our assets are located outside of the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for persons purchasing the class a ordinary shares to effect service of process within the united states upon us or to enforce judgments against us or judgments obtained in us courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states or any state of the united states 
turner roulstone  our cayman islands counsel  has advised us that although there is no statutory enforcement in the cayman islands of judgments obtained in the united states  the courts of the cayman islands will  based on the principle that a judgment by a competent foreign court will impose upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given  recognize and enforce a foreign judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction if such judgment is final  for a liquidated sum  not in respect of taxes or a fine or penalty if not inconsistent with a cayman islands judgment in respect of the same matters  and was not obtained in a manner  and is not of a kind  the enforcement of which is contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
there is doubt  however  as to whether the courts of the cayman islands will  in an original action in the cayman islands  recognize or enforce judgments of us courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state of the united states on the grounds that such provisions are penal in nature 
a cayman islands court may stay proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere 
unlike many jurisdictions in the united states  cayman islands law does not specifically provide for shareholder appraisal rights on a merger or consolidation of an entity 
this may make it more difficult for shareholders to assess the value of any consideration they may receive in a merger or consolidation or to require that the offeror give a shareholder additional consideration if he believes the consideration offered is insufficient 
shareholders of cayman islands exempted companies such as ours have no general rights under cayman islands law to inspect corporate records and accounts 
our directors have discretion under our articles to determine whether or not  and under what conditions  the corporate records may be inspected by shareholders  but are not obligated to make them available to shareholders 
this fact may make it more difficult for shareholders to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a shareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest 

table of contents subject to limited exceptions  under cayman islands law  a minority shareholder may not bring a derivative action against our board of directors 
provisions of our articles may reallocate the voting power of our class a ordinary shares and subject holders of class a ordinary shares to sec compliance 
in certain circumstances  the total voting power of our class a ordinary shares held by any one person will be reduced to less than and the total voting power of the class b ordinary shares will be reduced to of the total voting power of the total issued and outstanding ordinary shares 
in the event a holder of our class a ordinary shares acquires shares representing or more of the total voting power of our total ordinary shares or the class b ordinary shares represent more than of the total voting power of our total outstanding shares  there will be an effective reallocation of the voting power of the class a ordinary shares or class b ordinary shares which may cause a shareholder to acquire or more of the voting power of the total ordinary shares 
such a shareholder may become subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of sections d and g of the exchange act 
such a reallocation also may result in an obligation to amend previous filings made under section d or g of the exchange act 
under our articles  we have no obligation to notify shareholders of any adjustments to their voting power 
shareholders should consult their own legal counsel regarding the possible reporting requirements under section of the exchange act 
as at december   david einhorn owned of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares  which given that each class b share is entitled to ten votes  causes him to exceed the limitation imposed on the total voting power of the class b ordinary shares 
thus  the voting power held by the class b ordinary shares that is in excess of the limitation will be reallocated pro rata to holders of class a ordinary shares according to their percentage interest in the company 
however  no shareholder will be allocated voting rights that would cause it to have or more of the total voting power of our ordinary shares 
the allocation of the voting power of the class b ordinary shares to a holder of class a ordinary shares will depend upon the total voting power of the class b ordinary shares outstanding  as well as the percentage of class a ordinary shares held by a shareholder and the other holders of class a ordinary shares 
accordingly  we cannot estimate with precision what multiple of a vote per share a holder of class a ordinary shares will be allocated as a result of the anticipated reallocation of voting power of the class b ordinary shares 

table of contents risks relating to taxation we may become subject to taxation in the cayman islands  which would negatively affect our results 
under current cayman islands law  we are not obligated to pay any taxes in the cayman islands on either income or capital gains 
the governor in cabinet of cayman islands has granted us an exemption from the imposition of any such tax on us until february  we cannot be assured that after such date we would not be subject to any such tax 
if we were to become subject to taxation in the cayman islands  our financial condition and results of operations could be significantly and negatively affected 
see certain cayman islands tax considerations 
we may be subject to united states federal income taxation 
we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands and intend to operate in a manner that will not cause us to be treated as engaging in a trade or business within the united states and will not cause us to be subject to current united states federal income taxation on our net income 
however  because there are no definitive standards provided by the internal revenue code  regulations or court decisions as to the specific activities that constitute being engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the united states  and as any such determination is essentially factual in nature  we cannot assure you that the united states internal revenue service  or the irs  will not successfully assert that we are engaged in a trade or business within the united states 
if the irs were to successfully assert that we have been engaged in a trade or business within the united states in any taxable year  various adverse tax consequences could result  including the following we may become subject to current united states federal income taxation on our net income from sources within the united states  we may be subject to united states federal income tax on a portion of our net investment income  regardless of its source  we may not be entitled to deduct certain expenses that would otherwise be deductible from the income subject to united states taxation  and we may be subject to united states branch profits tax on profits deemed to have been distributed out of the united states 
united states persons who own class a ordinary shares may be subject to united states federal income taxation on our undistributed earnings and may recognize ordinary income upon disposition of class a ordinary shares 
passive foreign investment company 
significant potential adverse united states federal income tax consequences generally apply to any united states person who owns shares in a passive foreign investment company  or a pfic 
we believe that each of greenlight capital re and greenlight re was a pfic in  and we do not believe  although we cannot assure you  that either of greenlight capital re or greenlight re was a pfic for through we cannot provide assurance that either greenlight capital re or greenlight re will not be a pfic in or any future taxable year 
in general  either of greenlight capital re or greenlight re would be a pfic for a taxable year if either i or more of its income constitutes passive income or ii or more of its assets produce passive income 
passive income generally includes interest  dividends and other investment income but does not include income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation predominantly engaged in an insurance business 
this exception for insurance companies is intended to ensure that a bona fide insurance entity s income is not treated as passive income  except to the extent such income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the insurance business 
we believe that we are currently operating and intend to continue operating our business with financial reserves at a level that should not cause us to be deemed pfics  although we cannot assure you the irs will not successfully challenge this conclusion 
if we are unable to underwrite sufficient amount of risks  either of greenlight capital re or greenlight re may become a pfic 
in addition  sufficient risk must be transferred under an insurance entity s contracts with its insureds in order to qualify for the insurance exception 
whether our insurance contracts possess adequate risk transfer for purposes of determining whether income under our contracts is insurance income  and whether we are predominantly engaged in the insurance business  are subjective in nature and there is very little authority on these issues 
however  because we are and may continue to be engaged in certain structured risk and 
table of contents other non traditional reinsurance markets  we cannot assure you that the irs will not successfully challenge the level of risk transfer under our reinsurance contracts for purposes of the insurance company exception 
we cannot assure you that the irs will not successfully challenge our interpretation of the scope of the active insurance company exception and our qualification for the exception 
further  the irs may issue regulatory or other guidance that causes us to fail to qualify for the active insurance company exception on a prospective or retroactive basis 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will satisfy the exception for insurance companies and will not be treated as pfics currently or in the future 
controlled foreign corporation 
united states persons who  directly or indirectly or through attribution rules  own or more of our class a ordinary shares  which we refer to as united states shareholders  may be subject to the controlled foreign corporation  or cfc  rules 
under the cfc rules  each united states shareholder must annually include his pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if no distributions are made 
in general  a foreign insurance company will be treated as a cfc only if united states shareholders collectively own more than of the total combined voting power or total value of the entity s shares for an uninterrupted period of days or more during any year 
we believe that the dispersion of our class a ordinary shares among holders and the restrictions placed on transfer  issuance or repurchase of our class a ordinary shares including the ownership limitations described below  will generally prevent shareholders who acquire class a ordinary shares from being united states shareholders 
in addition  because our articles prevent any person from holding or more of the total combined voting power of our shares whether held directly  indirectly  or constructively  unless such provision is waived by the unanimous consent of our board of directors  we believe no persons holding class a ordinary shares should be viewed as united states shareholders of a cfc for purposes of the cfc rules 
we cannot assure you  however  that these rules will not apply to you 
if you are a united states person we strongly urge you to consult your own tax advisor concerning the cfc rules 
related person insurance income 
if our gross income attributable to insurance or reinsurance policies where the direct or indirect insureds are our direct or indirect united states shareholders or persons related to such united states shareholders equals or exceeds of our gross insurance income in any taxable year  and direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds owned directly or indirectly or more of the voting power or value of our stock  a united states person who owns class a ordinary shares directly or indirectly on the last day of the taxable year would most likely be required to include their pro rata share of our related person insurance income for the taxable year in their income 
this amount would be determined as if such related person insurance income were distributed proportionally to united states persons at that date 
we do not expect that we will knowingly enter into reinsurance agreements in which  in the aggregate  the direct or indirect insureds are  or are related to  owners of or more of the class a ordinary shares 
we do not believe that the gross insurance income threshold will be met 
however  we cannot assure you that this is or will continue to be the case 
consequently  we cannot assure you that a person who is a direct or indirect united states shareholder will not be required to include amounts in its income in respect of related person insurance income in any taxable year 
if a united states shareholder is treated as disposing of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has related person insurance income and in which united states persons own or more of the voting power or value of the entity s capital stock  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as a dividend to the extent of the united states shareholder s portion of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the united states shareholder owned the shares 
in addition  the shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the direct or indirect united states shareholder 
although not free from doubt  we believe these rules should not apply to dispositions of class a ordinary shares because greenlight re is not directly engaged in the insurance business and because proposed united states treasury regulations 
table of contents applicable to this situation appear to apply only in the case of shares of corporations that are directly engaged in the insurance business 
we cannot assure you  however  that the irs will interpret the proposed regulations in this manner or that the proposed regulations will not be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of class a ordinary shares 
united states tax exempt organizations who own class a ordinary shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income 
if you are a united states tax exempt organization you may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of our subpart f insurance income is allocated to you 
in general  subpart f insurance income will be allocated to you if we are a cfc as discussed above and you are a united states shareholder or there is related person insurance income and certain exceptions do not apply 
although we do not believe that any united states persons will be allocated subpart f insurance income  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
if you are a united states tax exempt organization  we advise you to consult your own tax advisor regarding the risk of recognizing unrelated business taxable income 
change in united states tax laws may be retroactive and could subject us  and or united states persons who own class a ordinary shares to united states income taxation on our undistributed earnings 
the tax laws and interpretations regarding whether an entity is engaged in a united states trade or business  is a cfc  has related party insurance income or is a pfic are subject to change  possibly on a retroactive basis 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the passive foreign investment company rules to an insurance company and the regulations regarding related party insurance income are still in proposed form 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be forthcoming from the irs 
we are not able to predict if  when or in what form such guidance will be provided and whether such guidance will have a retroactive effect 
the impact of the cayman islands letter of commitment or other concessions to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in the cayman islands 
the organization for economic cooperation and development  or oecd  has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s report  the cayman islands was not listed as a tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed itself to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
item b 
unresolved staff comments there are no unresolved staff comments regarding our current or periodic reports 
item properties we currently lease office space in grand cayman  cayman islands under an operating lease that expires on august  on july   we entered into an additional operating lease agreement for new office space in the cayman islands which expires on june  once we have occupied the new office space  we will no longer require the use of our current office space and we believe that for the foreseeable future the new office space will be sufficient for us to conduct our operations 
item legal proceedings we are not party to any pending or threatened material litigation or arbitration and are not currently aware of any pending or threatened litigation 
we anticipate that  similar to the rest of the reinsurance industry  we will be subject to litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business

c dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on our class a ordinary shares or class b ordinary shares  or collectively  ordinary shares 
we currently do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our ordinary shares 
however  if we decide to pay dividends  we cannot assure you sufficient cash will be available to pay such dividends 
in addition  a letter of credit facility prohibits us from paying dividends during an event of default as defined in the letter of credit agreement 
our future dividend policy will also depend on the requirements of any future financing agreements to which we may be a party and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors  such as our results of operations and cash flows  our financial position and capital requirements  general business conditions  rating agency guidelines  legal  tax  regulatory and any contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends 
further  any future declaration and payment of dividends is discretionary and our board of directors may at any time modify or revoke our dividend policy on our ordinary shares 
finally  our ability to pay dividends also depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us 
although greenlight capital re is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends  greenlight re is subject to cayman islands regulatory constraints that affect its ability to pay dividends and include a minimum net worth requirement 
currently the minimum statutory net worth requirement for greenlight re is  but subject to the discretion of cima 
as of december   greenlight re exceeded the minimum statutory capital requirement by million 
any dividends we pay will be declared and paid in us dollars
