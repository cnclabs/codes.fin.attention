item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a  part i  risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
we do not guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we do not intend to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this document to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations 
overview semiconductor and semiconductor equipment market conditions continued to deteriorate during the second half of our revenues decreased to million in compared to million in uncertainty in the world economic environment is impacting demand and the timing of customer spending 
in the fourth quarter of  revenues decreased to million  or  from in the third quarter of in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of during  we restructured our business by eliminating the divisional structure and put in place a functional organization  which we believe is more effective at this time 
executives and managers that previously had divisional oversight roles were reassigned functional responsibilities in sales  marketing or operations 
the restructuring  which also included the closure of our machine shop  closure of our sales and service office in england and move to outsourced manufacturing of mm systems  eliminated redundant divisional positions and lowered our cost structure through headcount reductions 
current uncertainty in market conditions requires ongoing review of our operations and may require further restructuring or other measures to lower our cost structure 
it is unclear when the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment market conditions will improve 
however  we believe that our competitive position  products  technology and balance sheet remain strong  and that we are well positioned to manage through the economic downturn 
outlook for the current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters  and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from our expectations 
we believe the market for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will continue to be uncertain through at least the first six months of  and  accordingly  we expect an overall decline in revenue for the first six months of compared to the first six months of

revenue revenue decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in 
table of contents systems revenue in systems decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in certain financial information which contributed to the systems revenue results was as follows compared to compared to percentage decrease in unit sales percentage increase decrease in average sales price we realized decreased unit sales in both our mm systems and our non mm systems in compared to due to the global slow down in semiconductor markets 
average sales prices in compared to were negatively affected by fewer high end mm systems sales in relation to total system sales as companies are not currently adding capacity 
in addition  the average sales price for the mm systems declined in compared to as a result of recent market pressure to reduce prices due to aggressive discounting activity by competitors  as well as a decrease in accessories sold with the mm systems 
average sales price includes the sales price of any analytical probes  probe cards and accessories purchased with an engineering probe station 
the decrease in unit sales in compared to was due to an increase in sales of our mm systems being offset by a decrease in unit sales of our non mm systems 
the increase in the mm systems was due to increased customer demand 
as more customers transitioned to our mm systems during  sales of non mm systems declined as a percentage of total system sales 
the increases in average sales price in compared to was primarily attributable to increased unit sales of our mm systems  which have a higher average sales price than our non mm systems  and declining unit sales of our non mm systems 
in addition  in compared to  the average sales price for our non mm systems increased  contributing to the overall increase 
probes and sockets revenue in probes and sockets increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to new product introductions  new design wins in the rf and wireless market  and continued focus on growth in market segments and applications other than our core rf business  especially in the parametric test market 
parametric test is the electrical verification of the wafer fabrication process quality and is used by all semiconductor wafer fabs world wide 
although probes and sockets revenue increased from to  revenue in the fourth quarter of decreased million  or  to million compared to million the third quarter of the revenue decrease in the fourth quarter of was driven by recent economic turmoil and the overall decrease in worldwide semiconductor production 
the increase in probes and sockets revenue in compared to was primarily due to the addition of gryphics  inc during the second quarter of  which accounted for million of the increase 

table of contents cost of sales and gross margin cost of sales includes purchased materials  fabrication  assembly  test  installation labor  overhead  customer specific engineering costs  warranty costs  royalties and provision for inventory valuation reserves 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in sales  partially offset by lower gross margins 
the increase in cost of sales in compared to was primarily due to the increase in sales  partially offset by higher gross margins 
systems the gross margin in systems decreased to in from in  primarily due to the overall decrease in unit sales as unallocated fixed overhead costs and inventory reserve charges were recorded as a period expense in cost of sales 
in addition  there was a shift in sales product mix to fewer mm systems  which typically yield higher gross margins and include more accessories 
the gross margin in systems increased slightly to in from in due to a decrease in distribution costs that was offset by higher overhead costs 
probes and sockets the gross margin in probes and sockets decreased to in from in  primarily due to lower than expected sales and production volume in the fourth quarter of  as unallocated fixed overhead costs were recorded as a period expense in cost of sales 
the decrease in fourth quarter production volume was partially offset by a gross margin in probes and sockets of through the first three quarters of as efficiencies were achieved with the higher production volumes in those quarters 
gross margin in probes and sockets increased to in from in  primarily due to improved production yields  lower warranty costs and increased use of the production facility for research and development 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include compensation and related expenses for personnel  materials  consultants and overhead 
from time to time  we enter into arrangements that provide for the reimbursement of research and development expenses 
such reimbursements are netted against gross research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in 
table of contents the increase decrease was primarily due to the following compared to decrease in wages and benefits due to lower headcount decrease in production costs allocated to r d increase in travel expenses increase in recruiting expenses other  net compared to increase in wages and benefits due to increased headcount increase in stock based compensation increase in production costs allocated to r d increase in severance increase in prototype parts and design changes other  net selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense includes compensation and related expenses for personnel  travel  outside services  manufacturers representative commissions  internally developed patent and trademark amortization and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  customer support  management  legal and other professional and administrative support functions  as well as costs to operate as a public company 
sg a expense increased million  or  to million in compared to million in and increased million  or  in compared to million in the increases were primarily due to the following compared to decrease in external sales commissions increase in accounting fees increase in stock based compensation expense increase in bad debt expense increase in severance costs increase in loss on disposals of long lived assets increase in travel expenses increase in temporary services and consulting fees other  net compared to increase in costs related to our china and taiwan sales offices opened in the second quarter of increase in wages and benefits due to increased headcount increase in it services  labor and other services due to international expansion increase in accounting fees increased stock based compensation expense increase in recruiting costs increase in severance due to reductions in workforce decrease in legal costs increase in costs related our german subsidiary opened in the third quarter of other  net 
table of contents amortization of purchased intangibles amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization related to our acquisition of certain assets of the evue product line in the fourth quarter of  the acquisition of gryphics  inc in the second quarter of and the acquisition of certain assets of synatron gmbh in the third quarter of net purchased intangibles totaled million at december  asset impairment asset impairment charges included the following in thousands year ended december  goodwill purchased intangible assets patents during the fourth quarter of  the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment markets continued to deteriorate and the trading price of our common stock declined significantly 
based on these factors  our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that the implied fair value of our identified reporting units was less than the carrying value of goodwill at december  we also tested long lived assets for impairment  which indicated that the fair value of certain long lived assets were less than carrying value as of december  accordingly  we recorded impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for additional information 
other income expense other income expense typically includes interest income  interest expense  gains and losses on sales of investments and transaction and remeasurement related foreign currency gains and losses 
other income expense can also include other miscellaneous non operating gains and losses 
transaction related foreign currency gains and losses result from gains and losses recognized primarily on foreign exchange forward contracts and on certain of our accounts receivable that are denominated in japanese yen 
other income expense  net was comprised of the following in thousands year ended december  interest income  net remeasurement related foreign currency gains losses gains losses related to foreign currency hedges other interest income represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances in due to the use of million  net of cash acquired  for the purchase of gryphics  inc in april and the purchase of certain assets of synatron gmbh in july in addition  interest rates were lower in compared to the decrease in compared to was due to the use of cash for acquisitions as mentioned above and the use of million during for the purchase of fixed assets  partially offset by million of cash generated by operations  net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of million and million of cash from the sale of stock pursuant to our stock plans 
these decreases were partially offset by higher interest rates in compared to 
table of contents income taxes our provision benefit for income taxes totaled million  or of income before income taxes  in  million  or of income before income taxes  in and million  or  of income before income taxes  in generally  the provision for income taxes is the result of the mix of profits losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates and changes in tax reserves 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our provision for income tax expense benefit based on our projected results of operations for the full year and record an adjustment in the current quarter 
the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due primarily to the full reserve we recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets and the goodwill write off  which was not deductable for tax purposes 
the effective tax rate differed from federal statutory rates primarily due to benefits from research and experimental tax credits  non deductible sfas no 
r stock based compensation and the non taxable income for federal tax purposes offset by increases to tax expense related to additions to tax contingencies recorded during the year and an out of period tax adjustment related to inter company sales and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses 
the effective tax rate differed from federal statutory rates primarily due to the benefit of non taxable interest income for federal tax purposes and the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit  offset by the non deductible sfas no 
r stock based compensation expense 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in was million and consisted of our net loss of million being offset by net non cash expenses of million and net changes in our operating assets and liabilities as described below 
accounts receivable  net decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december   due primarily to lower sales in the fourth quarter of than in the fourth quarter of inventories increased million to million at december  compared to million at december   as overall sales in have been lower than anticipated 
we believe that our inventory reserves of million are adequate at december  however  if our actual results are significantly different than our current projections for  we may be required to increase reserves for inventory in future periods 
net deferred tax assets increased to an asset of million at december  from a liability of million at december  the change in deferred taxes was primarily a result of a million impairment charge in related to purchased intangible assets  which decreased deferred tax liabilities by million  offset by a million increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
assets held for sale of million at december  included certain equipment related to our machine shop  which we closed in the third quarter of accrued liabilities decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december   due primarily to a decrease in income taxes payable of million and decrease in accrued vacation of million 
purchases of fixed assets of million in were primarily for production probe production and service related equipment 
we anticipate spending approximately million in  primarily for socket production related equipment 

table of contents proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million included proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
we anticipate meeting our cash requirements for the next months and for the foreseeable future from existing cash  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities  which totaled million at december   as well as from cash expected to be generated from operations 
we have  from time to time  evaluated  and continue to evaluate  opportunities for acquisition and expansion 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital 
seasonality typically  our revenue is lower in our fiscal first quarter than in our fiscal fourth quarter preceding it 
in addition  as is typical in our industry  we recognize a large percentage of our quarterly revenue in the last month of the quarter 
however  our seasonality can be affected by general economic trends and it should not be expected that historical revenue patterns will continue 
contractual commitments the following is a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond operating leases capital leases purchase order commitments purchase order commitments primarily represent open orders for inventory 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have become increasingly difficult to make in the current economic environment 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
it is possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales to customers that do not have acceptance criteria  including product sales to distributors  is recognized when a written purchase order has been obtained  the product is shipped  title has transferred  no obligations remain and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  we ship our products with ex works terms 
for any shipments with destination terms  we defer revenue until delivery to the customer 
revenue from customers who have acceptance criteria beyond our standard terms and conditions is deferred until all acceptance criteria are satisfied 
revenue for installation services  consisting of assembly and testing  and for systems shipped to integrators is also deferred 
deferred revenue related to service contracts is recognized over the life of the contract  typically one to two years 
deferred revenue for systems shipped to integrators is recognized upon shipment to the final customer 
our transactions may involve the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated based on the fair value of each element 
a typical multiple element arrangement may include some or all of the following components products  accessories  installation services and extended warranty contracts 
the total sales price is allocated based on the relative fair value of each component when sold separately 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on past collection history and known trends with current customers 
our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur based upon changes in revenue levels  associated balances in accounts receivable and estimated changes in collectability 
the current economic environment has increased both the risk of bad debt and the difficulty in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts by million  primarily for the specific reserve of receivables from one customer 
valuation of excess and obsolete inventory we regularly analyze the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including  but not limited to  the following forecasted sales or usage  historical usage rates  estimated service period  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values  service inventory requirements and new product introductions 
inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates cost computed on a first in  first out basis  or market and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventory is reviewed for obsolescence and excess quantities on a quarterly basis  based on estimated future use of quantities on hand  which is determined based on past usage  planned changes to products and known trends in markets and technology 
because of the long lived nature of many of our products  we maintain a supply of parts for use in future repairs and customer field service 
as these service parts become older  we apply a higher write down against the recorded balance  recognizing that the older the part  the less likely it will be used 
if circumstances related to our inventories change  our estimates of the value of inventory could materially change 
inventory write downs are recorded quarterly as a component of cost of sales 
lives and recoverability of equipment and other long lived assets we evaluate the remaining lives and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including our intangible assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if there is an indication of impairment  we prepare an estimate of future  undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
during  based on the results of our testing  we recorded impairment charges of million against purchased intangible assets and million against patents 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we did not record any impairment charges for long lived assets during or goodwill impairment testing goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is reviewed for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if a triggering event occurs  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value  and if an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill as determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow dcf analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill  which indicated that the implied fair value of our identified reporting units was less than the carrying value of goodwill at december  accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of as of december   we had no goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
there were no impairment charges in or warranty liabilities warranty costs include labor to repair the system and replacement parts for defective items  as well as other costs incidental to warranty repairs 
we estimate a liability for costs to repair or replace products under warranties ranging from days to one year and technical support costs when the related product revenue is recognized 
the products are sold without a right of return or price protection rights 
the liability for product warranties is calculated as a percentage of sales 
the percentage is based on historical actual product repair costs 
our estimated warranty costs are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes to the reserve occur as volume  product mix and actual warranty costs fluctuate 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record deferred tax assets for the estimated future benefit of research and development tax credits  foreign tax credits  net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences to the extent management believes these assets will be realized 
a valuation allowance is recorded when management can not reach the conclusion that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on this evaluation  in  we recorded a million charge to establish a full valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets  and increased the valuation allowance against foreign deferred tax assets by  following this increase  the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets totaled million at december  at december   we had net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet totaling million  primarily related to foreign jurisdictions 
we may record additional valuation allowances in the future 
uncertainty in income taxes fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority and applies to all tax positions accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as tax expense within our financial statements 
at december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  of which million would have an impact on the effective tax rate  and interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits were stock based compensation sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  non vested stock and stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we maintained our method of valuation for stock option awards using the black scholes valuation model  which has historically been used for the purpose of providing pro forma financial disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
the use of the black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest 
therefore  we have reduced the compensation expense to be recognized over the vesting period for anticipated future forfeitures 
forfeiture estimates are based on historical forfeiture patterns 
we update our forfeiture estimates quarterly and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  our results of operations could be materially impacted

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sometimes attempt to mitigate our currency exposures for recorded transactions by using forward exchange contracts 
the purpose of these activities is to reduce the risk that future cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in some cases  we enter into forward sale or purchase contracts for foreign currencies  primarily the japanese yen  to hedge specific receivables and bookings positions 
as of december   we had contracts outstanding for the purchase of japanese yen totaling approximately million  which mature through march historically  we have not attempted to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the remeasurement of our subsidiaries net assets and results of operations  nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our forward exchange contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas no 
 and  accordingly  gains and losses on our forward exchange contracts are recognized currently as a component of other income expense 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
as of december   we held cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of one percent would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income related to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million  assuming our december  balances remained constant 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially affect the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we held long term fixed rate investments of million that consisted primarily of municipal obligations 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows  as we have classified our securities as available for sale and  therefore  may choose to sell or hold them as changes in the market occur 
declines in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our long term investments  as funds are re invested at current market interest rates
