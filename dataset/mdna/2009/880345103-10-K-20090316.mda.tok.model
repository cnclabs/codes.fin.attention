net earnings for were down to million  or per diluted share  compared to net sales totaled million  up over driven primarily by sales from strategic acquisitions during the year  a net favorable impact from foreign currency exchange and benefits from pricing actions taken earlier in the year  partially offset by unit volume declines within our equipment business year over year 
gross margins declined basis points to principally due to our inability to leverage our fixed manufacturing costs as a result of the significant unit volume decline experienced in the fourth quarter of selling and administrative expense s a expense increased basis points as a percentage of net sales to compared to due to the inclusion of a workforce reduction and other charges recognized in the fourth quarter of as well as s a expense incurred earlier in the year to expand international market coverage and support new product launches 
during the fourth quarter of  tennant announced a workforce reduction program to resize its worldwide employee base by approximately  or about people 
a pretax workforce reduction charge totaling million per diluted share was recognized in the fourth quarter of as a result of this program 
the workforce reduction was accomplished primarily through the elimination of salaried positions across the organization 
when completed  this measure is estimated to achieve annualized savings of at least million in and approximately million in additionally  early retirements  elimination of contracted positions and attrition will account for some of the eliminated positions and contribute to these annualized savings 
the pretax charge consisted primarily of severance and outplacement service expenses and was included within s a expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
s a expense was also impacted by a significant increase in bad debt expense of million per diluted share resulting from increased accounts receivable reserves due to the global credit crisis and a write off of million per diluted share related to technology investments that will be replaced by new solutions 
net earnings were impacted by a per diluted share loss from our acquisitions 
this amount includes the effect of purchase accounting items such as amortization expense on acquired intangible assets  the flow through of the fair market value inventory step up  the unfavorable movement in the foreign currency exchange rates related to a deal contingent non speculative forward contract that we entered into which fixed the cash outlay in us dollars for our sociedade alfa ltda alfa acquisition  as well as the increase in interest expense related to borrowing against our revolving credit facility during the year to fund our first quarter acquisitions

expenses of per diluted share related to curtailed acquisition initiatives 
a net gain of million per diluted share associated with the divestiture of assets related to the centurion street sweeper product

back in  we launched initiatives aimed at consolidating our global footprint  expanding our presence in china and establishing global sourcing capabilities 
through these initiatives  we continue to broaden our global sourcing capabilities  reduce product costs and improve operating efficiencies 
our global sourcing initiative contributed approximately million in savings during  allowing us to essentially offset the impact of inflation in despite experiencing rising material costs throughout the majority of the year 
we also successfully increased the percentage of materials and components sourced from low cost regions from approximately in to approximately in our footprint consolidation and lean initiatives contributed approximately million in savings in  in part from benefits of closing our maple grove  mn facility toward the end of tennant continues to invest in innovative product development  with of net sales spent on research and development in we launched six new products in in addition to the global introduction of our electrically converted water technology ec water on six of our walk behind scrubbers 
sales of new products introduced in the past three years generated approximately of our equipment sales during  exceeding our target of 
our new product launches in will focus on expanding the roll out of ec water

the relative strength or weakness of the global economies in is expected to impact demand for our products and services in the markets we serve 
as both global and regional economies are currently difficult to predict  we continue to monitor macro economic indicators closely and conservatively manage the business 
our results are also impacted by changes in value of the us dollar primarily against the euro  british pound  australian and canadian dollars  japanese yen  chinese yuan and brazilian real 
to the extent the applicable exchange rates weaken relative to the us dollar  the related direct foreign currency exchange effect would generally have an unfavorable impact on our results 
if the applicable exchange rates strengthen relative to the us dollar  our results would generally be favorably impacted

there was no balance outstanding on this facility at december  contractual obligations our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december   are summarized by period due in the following table in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations collateralized borrowings capital leases interest payments on capital leases residual value guarantees retirement benefit plans deferred compensation arrangements other long term employee benefits unrecognized tax benefits operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations our credit agreement does not have specified repayment terms  therefore  repayment is due upon expiration of the agreement on june  collateralized borrowings represent deferred sales proceeds on certain leasing transactions with third party leasing companies 
these transactions are accounted for as borrowings under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases sfas no 

we would be expected to fund these obligations only as a result of a default in lease payments by the purchaser 
certain operating leases for vehicles contain residual value guarantee provisions  which would become due at the expiration of the operating lease agreement if the fair value of the leased vehicles is less than the guaranteed residual value 
of those leases that contain residual value guarantees  the aggregate residual value at lease expiration is million  of which we have guaranteed million 
as of december   we have recorded a liability for the fair value of this residual value guarantee of million 
our retirement benefit plans  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  require us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
our plan obligations totaled million as of december  contributions to the various plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the market performance of plan assets  if any  and future changes in interest rates  which impact the actuarial measurement of plan obligations 
as a result  we have only included our million of expected contributions in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 

table of contents the unfunded deferred compensation arrangements covering certain current and retired management employees totaled million as of december  our estimated distributions in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table are based upon a number of assumptions including termination dates and participant distribution elections 
other long term employee benefit arrangements are comprised of long term incentive compensation arrangements with certain key management  foreign defined contribution plans and other long term arrangements totaling million 
we cannot predict the timing or amount of our future payments associated with these arrangements  as a result  these obligations are not included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled  as a result  these obligations are not included in the table above 
operating lease commitments consist primarily of office and warehouse facilities  vehicles and office equipment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have applied the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  and have determined that our agreement with our third party logistics provider contains an operating lease under sfas no 
as a result  we have included the future minimum lease payments related to the underlying building lease in our operating lease commitments in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table 
in the event we elect to cancel the agreement with our third party logistics provider prior to the contract expiration date we would be required to assume the underlying building lease for the remainder of its term 
unconditional purchase obligations include purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business and contractual purchase commitments 
during  we amended our non cancellable purchase commitment with a third party manufacturer to extend the terms of the agreement to the remaining commitment under this agreement totaled million as of december  this purchase commitment has been included in the contractual cash obligations and commitments table along with purchase orders entered into in the ordinary course of business 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  application of fasb statement no 
to fasb statement no 
and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement fsp fas which states that sfas no 
does not address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement 
fsp fas does not apply to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that are required to be measured at fair value under sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
or sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  regardless of whether those assets and liabilities are related to leases 
in february  the fasb also issued fsp fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp fas 
fsp fas defers the implementation of sfas no 
for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
we adopted the required provisions of sfas no 
as of january  and will adopt the provisions of fsp fas on january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations and we do not expect that the adoption of fsp fas will have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired to be recorded at full fair value 
this statement also establishes disclosure requirements that will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
r will apply prospectively to business combinations completed on or after january  in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets fsp fas r 
fsp fas r provides guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this staff position pertains only to the disclosures and does not affect the accounting for defined benefit pensions or other postretirement plans  therefore  we do not anticipate that the adoption of fsp fas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record a reserve for accounts receivable that are potentially uncollectible 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of these receivables  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
our reserves are also based on amounts determined by using percentages applied to trade receivables 
these percentages are determined by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  current economic trends  historical payment and bad debt write off experience 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of our customers and if circumstances related to these customers deteriorate  our estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if more allowances are provided than are ultimately required  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods based on the actual collection experience 
bad debt write offs as a percentage of net sales were less than in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved against our accounts receivable for doubtful accounts 
inventory reserves we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of inventory or fair market value through the establishment of a reserve for excess  
table of contents slow moving and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements compared with inventory levels 
reserve requirements are developed by comparing our inventory levels to our projected demand requirements based on historical demand  market conditions and technological and product life cycle changes 
it is possible that an increase in our reserve may be required in the future if there are significant declines in demand for certain products 
this reserve creates a new cost basis for these products and is considered permanent 
we also record a reserve for inventory shrinkage 
our inventory shrinkage reserve represents anticipated physical inventory losses that are recorded and adjusted as a part of our cycle counting and physical inventory procedures 
the reserve amount is based on historical loss trends  historical physical and cycle count adjustments as well as inventory levels 
changes in the reserve result from the completed cycle counts and physical inventories 
as of december   we had million reserved against inventories 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired and is allocated to our reporting units at the time of the acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we test goodwill on an annual basis and when an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of one of our reporting units below its carrying amount 
a goodwill impairment loss occurs if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step is used as an indicator to identify if there is a potential goodwill impairment loss 
if the first step indicates there may be a loss  the second step is performed which measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss  if any 
we perform our goodwill impairment test as of year end and use our judgment to develop assumptions for the discounted cash flow model that we use 
management assumptions include forecasting revenues and margins  estimating capital expenditures  depreciation  amortization and discount rates 
if our goodwill impairment testing resulted in one or more of our reporting units carrying amount exceeding its fair value  we would write down our reporting units carrying amount to its fair value and would record an impairment loss in our results of operations in the period such determination is made 
subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
each of our reporting units were tested for impairment as of december  and based upon our analysis  the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts and therefore we have not recorded an impairment loss as of december  we had goodwill of million as of december  warranty reserves we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the historical ratio of claims to net sales  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim  new product introductions and other factors 
future claims experience could be materially different from prior results because of the introduction of new  more complex products  a change in our warranty policy in response to industry trends  competition or other external forces  or manufacturing changes that could impact product quality 
in the event we determine that our current or future product repair and replacement costs exceed our estimates  an adjustment to these reserves would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was in  in and in as of december   we had million reserved for future estimated warranty costs 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions 
we also establish reserves for uncertain tax matters that are complex in nature and uncertain as to the ultimate outcome 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we consider our ability to ultimately prevail in defending these matters when establishing these reserves 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
we believe that our current reserves are adequate 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax returns  and some differences will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years but have already been recorded as an expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  based on management s judgment  to the extent we believe that recovery is less likely than not  we establish a valuation reserve against those deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax asset valuation allowance could be materially different from actual results because of changes in the mix of future taxable income  the relationship between book and taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
as of december   a valuation allowance of million was recorded against foreign tax loss carryforwards

we caution that forward looking statements must be considered carefully and that actual results may differ in material ways due to risks and uncertainties 
table of contents both known and unknown 
shareholders  potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating forward looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
for additional information about factors that could materially affect tennant s results  please see our other securities and exchange commission filings  including disclosures under risk factors in this document 
we do not undertake to update any forward looking statement  and investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by us on this matter in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and in other written statements we make from time to time 
it is not possible to anticipate or foresee all risk factors  and investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive or complete list of all risks or uncertainties 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk we are subject to exposures resulting from potential cost increases related to our purchase of raw materials or other product components 
we do not use derivative commodity instruments to manage our exposures to changes in commodity prices such as steel  oil  gas  lead and other commodities 
various factors beyond our control affect the price of oil and gas  including but not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  domestic and foreign governmental regulation  weather related factors and the overall economic environment 
we purchase petroleum related component parts for use in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  our freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales and service vehicle fuel costs are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
increases in worldwide demand and other factors affect the price for lead  steel and related products 
we do not maintain an inventory of raw or fabricated steel or batteries in excess of near term production requirements 
as a result  increases in the price of lead or steel can significantly increase the cost of our lead and steel based raw materials and component parts 
during  our raw materials and other purchased component costs were unfavorably impacted by commodity prices although we were able to mitigate these higher costs with pricing actions and cost reduction actions 
we will continue to focus on mitigating the risk of continued future raw material or other product component cost increases through product pricing  negotiations with our vendors and cost reduction actions 
the success of these efforts will depend upon our ability to increase our selling prices in a competitive market and our ability to achieve cost savings 
if the commodity prices increase  our results may be unfavorably impacted in foreign currency exchange risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to exposures resulting from foreign currency exchange fluctuations in the normal course of business 
our primary exchange rate exposures are with the euro  british pound  australian and canadian dollars  japanese yen  chinese yuan and brazilian real against the us dollar 
the direct financial impact of foreign currency exchange includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies to us dollars  the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between tennant operations in the united states and abroad and transaction gains and losses 
in addition to the direct financial impact  foreign currency exchange has an indirect financial impact on our results  including the effect on sales volume within local economies and the impact of pricing actions taken as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
because a substantial portion of our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger us dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize the earnings effects associated with foreign exchange rate changes on certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
we periodically enter into various contracts  principally forward exchange contracts  to protect the value of certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
the gains and losses on these contracts generally approximate changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities 
we had forward exchange contracts outstanding in the notional amounts of approximately million and million at the end of and  respectively 
the potential for material loss in fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding and the related underlying exposures as of december   from a adverse change is unlikely due to the short term nature of our forward contracts 
our policy prohibits us from entering into transactions for speculative purposes 
other matters management regularly reviews our business operations with the objective of improving financial performance and maximizing our return on investment 
as a result of this ongoing process to improve financial performance  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future which  if taken  could be material to our financial results
