this increase was due to the growth of absg and the growth of abdc  which was impacted by the july  loss of certain business approximately billion on an annualized basis with a national retail drug chain customer 
excluding the loss of the above mentioned business  total revenue in fiscal would have increased by from the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal and  of total revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers 
sales to institutional customers increased in the current fiscal year primarily due to the growth of absg and the addition of a new large hospital buying group customer 
sales to retail customers decreased in the current fiscal year as the loss of the above mentioned national chain business was offset  in part  by market growth and the addition of a new large independent retail buying group customer 
we report as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  whereby we act as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products 
bulk delivery transactions are arranged by us at the express direction of the customer  and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers warehouse sites ie  drop shipment or shipments from the supplier to us for immediate shipment to the customers warehouse sites ie  cross dock shipment 
bulk deliveries of billion in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year 
this decline was due to the prior year transition of a significant amount of business previously conducted on a bulk delivery basis with our largest customer to an operating revenue basis 
we are a principal to bulk delivery transactions because we are the primary obligor and have the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products purchased  and bear full risk of delivery and loss for products  whether the products are drop shipped or shipped cross dock 
we also bear full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer 
as a result  we record bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues 
due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries  fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on our operating margins 
however  revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on our cash flows due to favorable timing between customer payments to us and payments by us to our suppliers 

table of contents abdc s total revenue in fiscal increased by from the prior fiscal year  primarily due to revenue from two new large customers  and was partially offset by the loss of certain business with a large retail drug chain customer  as mentioned above 
absg s total revenue in fiscal of billion increased from the prior fiscal year due to good growth broadly across its distribution and service businesses  offset in part  by declining anemia drug sales see paragraph below 
the majority of absg s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology 
absg also distributes vaccines  plasma and other blood products 
absg s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals  including oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs 
since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians  any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues 
revenue related to the distribution of anemia related products  which represented of total revenue in fiscal  decreased approximately from the prior fiscal year 
the decline in sales of anemia related products has been most pronounced in the use of these products for cancer treatment 
sales of oncology related anemia products represented approximately of total revenue in fiscal  and decreased approximately from the prior fiscal year 
several developments have contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs  including expanded warning and other product safety labeling requirements  more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients undergoing dialysis or experiencing kidney failure  and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use 
as a result  oncology related anemia drug sales have declined further in fiscal from our fiscal total 
in addition  the us food and drug administration fda is continuing to review clinical study data concerning the possible risks associated with certain anemia products and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms announced last year that it is considering a review of national medicare policy for these drugs for patients who have cancer or pre dialysis kidney disease 
the fda or cms may take additional action regarding the use  safety labeling and or medicare coverage of these drugs in the future 
further changes in medical guidelines for anemia drugs may impact the availability and extent of reimbursement for these drugs from third party payors  including federal and state governments and private insurance plans 
our future revenue growth rate and or profitability may continue to be impacted by any future reductions in reimbursement for anemia drugs or changes that limit the dosage and or use of anemia drugs 
we expect that our total revenue growth in fiscal for abdc and absg will be between and 
due to the addition of two significant new customers in march and april  we expect revenue growth will be higher in the first half of fiscal than in the second half 
our expected growth reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions  including increases in prescription drug utilization  the introduction of new products  and higher branded pharmaceutical prices  offset  in part  by the increased use of lower priced generics 
our growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix 
industry sales in the united states  as recently estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare  inc ims  are expected to grow between and in calendar ims expects that certain sectors of the market  such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals  will grow faster than the overall market 
additionally  ims expects the us pharmaceutical industry to grow annually in the low to mid single digit percentages through our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends  including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers  general economic conditions in the united states  competition within the industry  customer consolidation  changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices  increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates  and changes in federal government rules and regulations 
gross profit of billion in fiscal increased by million or from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to the strong growth and increased profitability of our generic programs  including specialty generics with generic revenue increasing by in comparison to the prior fiscal year  increased contributions from our fee for service agreements including million of fees relating to prior period sales resulting from the execution of new agreements in the quarter ended december   and good growth from absg s businesses  all of which was offset  in part  by absg s million write down of influenza vaccine inventory in the december quarter  and normal competitive pressures on customer margins in the current fiscal year 
gross profit in fiscal benefited from a settlement of million with a former customer 
gross profit in the prior fiscal year benefited from a gain of million relating to favorable litigation settlements with a former customer and a major competitor  and an million settlement of disputed fees with a supplier  and was partially offset by an million inventory write down of certain pharmacy equipment 
additionally  in the prior fiscal year  we recognized a gain of million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this gain  which was excluded from the determination of pharmaceutical distribution segment s gross profit  was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
the company is unable to estimate future gains  if any  it will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a percentage of total revenue  gross profit in fiscal was  an increase of basis point from the prior fiscal year 

table of contents our cost of goods sold includes a last in  first out lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities  product mix  and manufacturer pricing practices  which may be impacted by market and other external influences 
we recorded a lifo charge of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal and lifo charges reflect brand name supplier price inflation  which more than offset price deflation of generic drugs 
operating expenses of billion in fiscal declined by nearly million when compared to the prior fiscal year as a decrease in facility consolidations  employee severance and other charges of million  a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of million  and a decrease in asset impairment charges of million were offset  in part  by an increase in bad debt expense of million 
asset impairment charges in the current fiscal year included trade name impairment charges of million and the write off of certain capitalized software totaling million 
asset impairment charges in the prior fiscal year included trade name impairment charges of million related to certain of our smaller business units and impairment charges related to capitalized equipment and software development costs totaling million  primarily due to abdc s decision to abandon the use of certain software  which will be replaced in connection with our business transformation project 
additionally  expenses incurred in fiscal in connection with our business transformation project  which includes a new enterprise resource planning erp platform  increased by million from the prior fiscal year 
as a result of our ce initiative described below  we have been able to substantially offset these incremental costs by reducing our warehouse operating costs through continuing productivity improvements and by streamlining our organizational structures within abdc and absg

our net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings  interest rates  and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 
income taxes in fiscal reflect an effective income tax rate of  compared to in the prior fiscal year 
due to the impact of discrete tax events  we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal  thereby reducing our effective tax rate from the prior fiscal year 
income from continuing operations of million in fiscal increased from million in the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income  the decrease in interest expense and the reduction in the effective income tax rate 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of in fiscal increased from per share in the prior fiscal year 
the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was due to the reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources  net of the impact of stock option exercises 
loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  in fiscal included a final pmsi working capital adjustment of million and costs in connection with a prior period business disposition

year ended september  compared with year ended september  operating results total revenue of billion in fiscal  which includes bulk deliveries to customer warehouses  increased from the prior fiscal year 
this increase was driven by the pharmaceutical distribution segment  which received a contribution from the bellco acquisition 
during fiscal  of total revenue was from sales to institutional customers and was from sales to retail customers  this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of institutional and retail 
in comparison to the prior fiscal year results  sales to institutional customers increased primarily due to the acquisition of bellco the revenue of which is heavily weighted towards institutional customers and the strong growth of certain large customers 
sales to retail customers decreased primarily due to our decision not to renew a contract  effective january  with a large retail customer and the july  loss of certain business totaling approximately billion of annual revenue from a large retail drug chain customer 
bulk deliveries of billion in fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year 
this decline was due to the fiscal transition of a significant amount of business previously conducted on a bulk delivery basis with our largest customer to an operating revenue basis 
revenue relating to bulk deliveries fluctuates primarily due to changes in demand from our largest bulk customer 
due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries  fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins 
however  revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on our cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to us and payments by us to our suppliers

this revenue growth was primarily due to the increase in sales to certain of our large institutional customers  offset  in part  by the decline in retail customer revenue  as discussed above 
absg s total revenue excluding bellco of billion in fiscal increased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to strong double digit growth of its non oncology distribution businesses 
oncology distribution s revenue  which represented approximately of absg s total revenue  was flat compared to the prior fiscal year 
absg s revenue growth was affected primarily by declining anemia drug sales and by one of its large customers for oncology drugs being acquired by a competitor in october the former customer contributed approximately million to absg s revenue in fiscal the majority of absg s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals  primarily injectibles  to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states  especially oncology

these declines were related to the other segment  as the prior year s consolidated results included million of gross profit from the operating results of long term care through the july  spin off date 
the other segment gross profit decrease was offset  in part  by the increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment s gross profit in fiscal  primarily due to revenue growth  growth of our generic programs  the acquisition of bellco  and strong brand name manufacturer price appreciation

critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for a complete list of significant accounting policies  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns 
in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider a combination of factors  such as the aging of trade receivables  industry trends  and our customers financial strength  credit standing  and payment and default history 
changes in the aforementioned factors  among others  may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise 
we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote 
each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly 
there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september   and and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods 
the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts  net of write offs  recoveries and other adjustments 
schedule ii of this form k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september  and was million and million  respectively 
bad debt expense for the fiscal year ended september  was million  which included long term care s bad debt expense of million 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately million 

table of contents supplier reserves we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives  including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them 
these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims  historical experience with the suppliers  the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us 
we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances 
an increase or decrease of in the supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately million 
the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 
loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
we regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 
merchandise inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost for approximately and of our inventories at september  and  respectively  has been determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
if we had used the first in  first out fifo method of inventory valuation  which approximates current replacement cost  inventories would have been approximately million and higher than the amounts reported at september  and  respectively 
we recorded a lifo charge of million  million  and million in fiscal   and respectively 
during the fiscal year ended september   inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years 
the effect of the liquidation in fiscal was to decrease cost of goods sold by million and increase diluted earnings per share by 
business combinations the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values  with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships  trade names  existing technology  and other intangible assets  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual events 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
intangible assets with finite lives  primarily customer relationships  non compete agreements  patents and software technology  are amortized over their useful lives 
in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit and or the component of the entity being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value impairment indicators 
this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows  analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management 
in fiscal  due to the existence of impairment indicators at us bioservices  a specialty pharmacy company within the company s specialty group  we performed an impairment test on the pharmacy s trade name as of june   which resulted in an impairment charge of million 
in fiscal  pmsi experienced certain customer losses and learned that it would lose its largest customer at the end of calendar as a result  and after considering other factors  we committed to a plan to divest pmsi 
we performed an interim impairment test of our pmsi reporting unit and determined that its goodwill was impaired 
therefore  pmsi wrote off the carrying value of its goodwill of million 
in addition  we also recognized charges of million to record the estimated loss on the sale of pmsi see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal and and  as a result  recorded million and million of impairment charges  respectively 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to the business model  or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 

table of contents share based compensation we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share based compensation expense  which involves the use of several assumptions  including expected term of the option  future volatility  dividend yield and forfeiture rate 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors  such as implied volatility 
income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
we have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually 
after application of the valuation allowances described above  we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 
during fiscal  we adopted accounting standards codification asc  income taxes formerly referenced as fasb financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which changed the framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
we have established an estimated liability for federal  state and non us income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
however  others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 
the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change  an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by million in fiscal

abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility 
after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected  additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility 
we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 
we securitize our trade accounts  which are generally non interest bearing

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and  therefore  reduce purchases by our customers 
in addition  volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms 
reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth  our profitability  and our cash flow from operations 
in september  one of our lenders under the multi currency revolving credit facility filed for bankruptcy  and as a result  our availability under this facility was reduced by million to million 
we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of our lenders and while we do not currently anticipate the failure of any additional lenders under our revolving credit facilities and or under the liquidity facilities of our receivables securitization facility  the failure of any further lenders could have an adverse effect on our ability to finance our business operations

the increase in accounts receivable  merchandise inventories and accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes all principally related to our revenue growth in the month of september in comparison to the prior year month 
additionally  our merchandise inventory and related accounts payable balances were also impacted by inventory purchases of approximately million in the month of september  primarily relating to the purchase of generic products due to a recent product launch and purchases made in advance of a manufacturer s temporary plant shut down in connection with its facility consolidation efforts 
the average number of days sales outstanding in fiscal decreased to days from days in fiscal primarily due to favorable customer mix within abdc

operating cash uses during fiscal included million in interest payments and million of income tax payments  net of refunds

non cash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of million  which was significantly higher than the prior fiscal year due to the increase in income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories increased slightly despite the increase in total revenue  as the number of average inventory days on hand decreased by days compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the continued benefits achieved from the consolidation of our distribution network and strong inventory management 
accounts receivable declined by million from the prior fiscal year compared to the increase in sales as average days sales outstanding declined from days in fiscal to days in fiscal due to changes in customer mix including the july  sales reduction with a large chain customer

the increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in sales and days payable outstanding 
days payable outstanding in fiscal increased by days from the prior fiscal year due to favorable timing of payments to our suppliers and the strong growth of absg  which has a higher days payable outstanding ratio than abdc because certain of absg s businesses have more favorable payment terms with their suppliers 
the inventory turnover rate for the pharmaceutical distribution segment improved to times in fiscal from times in the prior fiscal year 
the number of inventory days on hand decreased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the benefits resulting from having completed our integration plan to consolidate the abdc distribution network and the strong growth of absg s business  which has lower inventory days on hand requirements 
after several years of consolidation activity  the us abdc distribution facilities in fiscal provided a stable distribution network environment  which combined with strong inventory management  resulted in a significant reduction in safety stock inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to the increase in operating revenue and an increase in average days sales outstanding for the pharmaceutical distribution segment 
average days sales outstanding for the pharmaceutical distribution segment increased to days in fiscal from days in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was largely driven by the above market rate growth of the specialty group  which generally has a higher receivable investment than the abdc distribution business

however  the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings  financial condition  capital requirements and other factors 
market risk our most significant market risk is the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt 
we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
at september   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements 
we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates 
however  there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to us 
there were no such financial instruments in effect at september  we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents 
we had billion in cash and cash equivalents at september  the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable rate debt 
for every million of cash invested that is in excess of variable rate debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by million 
we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non us operations 
our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar 
we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates 
such contracts generally have durations of less than one year 
we had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september  we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements on july   we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 topic generally accepted accounting principles  which amended accounting standards codification asc  generally accepted accounting principles  to establish the codification as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
on the effective date  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all previous references to the superseded standards in our consolidated financial statements have been replaced by references to the applicable sections of the codification 
the adoption of these sections did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  formerly referenced as sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this new accounting standard did not require any new fair value measurements 
asc defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
asc establishes a fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels 
level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs are observable other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
at september   we had million of investments in a money market account  which was valued as a level investment 
effective october   we will apply the provisions of asc to fair value measurements relating to all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as goodwill and other intangible assets  that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
this adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted asc  financial instruments formerly referenced as sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
we have not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments not already required to be measured at fair value 
on june   we adopted asc  subsequent events  which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued 
we evaluated subsequent events through the date and time our financial statements were issued on november  effective october   we will adopt the applicable sections of asc  business combinations  which provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree of a business combination 
additionally  this asc provides disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
we will also adopt certain other applicable sections that address application issues raised on the initial recognition and measurement  subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities from contingencies from a business combination 
the application of asc relating to an acquisition or divestiture subsequent to september  may have an impact to our financial condition and or results of operations
