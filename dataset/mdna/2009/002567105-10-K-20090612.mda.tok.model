item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a 
risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business overview abaxis  inc develops  manufactures  markets and sells portable blood analysis systems for use in the human or veterinary patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
our primary product is a blood analysis system  consisting of a compact portable analyzer and a series of single use plastic discs  called reagent discs  containing all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests on human patients and tests on veterinary patients 
we manufacture the system in our manufacturing facility in union city  california and we market our blood chemistry analyzers in both the medical market and in the veterinary market  as described below 
medical market we currently market the blood analysis system in the medical market under the name piccolo xpress 
through october  we marketed the blood analysis system in the medical market as the piccolo  now referred to as the piccolo classic 
we continue to support and service our current population of piccolo xpress and piccolo classic chemistry analyzers 
veterinary market we currently market the blood analysis system in the veterinary market under the name vetscan vs 
through march  we marketed the blood analysis system in the veterinary market as the vetscan  now referred to as the vetscan classic 
we continue to support and service our current population of vetscan vs and vetscan classic chemistry analyzers 
in september  we introduced a veterinary hematology instrument under the name vetscan hm the vetscan hm offers a parameter complete blood count cbc analysis  including a five part differential cell counter specifically designed for veterinary applications 
in may  we introduced a veterinary hematology instrument that offers an parameter cbc analysis  including a three part white blood cell differential  marketed originally as the vetscan hmii  and is now referred to as the vetscan hm we currently purchase the hematology instruments from diatron medical instruments plc 
of budapest  hungary 
through april  we marketed a veterinary hematology instrument under the name vetscan hmt 
we continue to support and service our current population of vetscan hm  vetscan hm  vetscan hmii and vetscan hmt hematology instruments 
we also market reagent kits to be used with our hematology instruments which we currently purchase from three suppliers clinical diagnostic solutions  inc  diatron medical instruments plc 
and mallinckrodt baker bv 
in july  our sales office in darmstadt  germany was incorporated as abaxis europe gmbh to market  promote and distribute diagnostic systems for medical and veterinary uses 
as a result  abaxis europe gmbh became a wholly owned subsidiary of abaxis 
the subsidiary was formed to provide customer support in a timely manner in response to the growing and increasingly diverse services needs of customers in the european market 
in january  we introduced a veterinary coagulation analyzer under the name vetscan vspro 
the vetscan vspro assists in the diagnosis and evaluation of suspected bleeding disorders  toxicity poisoning  evaluation of disseminated intravascular disease  hepatic disease and monitoring therapy and progression of disease states 
the point of care coagulation analyzer is offered with a combination assay pt aptt test cartridge for canine testing 
we currently purchase the coagulation analyzers and coagulation reagents from scandinavian micro biodevices aps of farum  denmark 
in january  we introduced a canine heartworm rapid test under the name vetscan canine heartworm rapid test 
the vetscan canine heartworm rapid test is a highly sensitive and specific test for the detection of dirofilaria immitis in canine whole blood  serum or plasma 
the lateral flow immunoassay technology in the canine heartworm rapid tests provides immediate results 

table of contents our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty  and may depend on a number of factors outside of our control  including but not limited to inventory or timing considerations by our distributors 
we generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our piccolo and vetscan products and to successfully compete with other competitors 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful indicators of future results 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the medical and veterinary markets 
revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are recognized when i evidence of an arrangement exists  ii upon shipment of the products to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or non current liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments 
revenues from such sales are allocated separately to the instruments and incentives based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenues allocated to incentives are deferred until the goods are shipped to the customer or are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
at march   and  the current portion of deferred revenue balances was million   and  respectively  and the non current portion of deferred revenue balances was million  million and million  respectively 
the fluctuation in balances is due to the types of customer incentives programs offered during the period and depends on when the free goods are shipped to the customer and the maintenance period of the maintenance agreements 
we periodically offer trade in programs to customers for trading in an existing instrument to purchase a new instrument and we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods or reduce the sales price of the instrument 
these incentives in the form of free goods are recorded according to the policies described above 
distributor and customer rebates 
we offer distributor pricing rebates and customer incentives from time to time 
the distributor pricing rebates are offered to distributors upon meeting the sales volume requirements during a qualifying period 
the distributor pricing rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues during a qualifying 
table of contents period 
cash rebates are offered to distributors or customers who purchase certain products or instruments during a promotional period 
cash rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues 
the distributor pricing rebate program is offered to distributors in the north america veterinary market  upon meeting the sales volume requirements of veterinary products during the qualifying period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and which rebate percentage applies 
based on these factors and using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction to gross revenues when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to three months after sale 
at march   and  the accrual balances related to distributor pricing rebates were   and  respectively 
the changes in the rebate accrual at each fiscal year end are based upon distributors meeting the purchase requirements during the quarter 
other rebate programs offered to distributors or customers vary from period to period in the medical and veterinary markets 
generally  the rebate program relates to the sale of certain products during a specified promotional period 
as part of the rebate program  a distributor or customer receives a cash rebate upon purchasing the products in the north america market during a promotional period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of a rebate 
we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction of gross revenues when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to six months after sale 
at march   and  the accrual balances related to rebates were  and  respectively 
the changes in the rebate accrual were due to the type of marketing promotions offered during the fiscal year and timing of the rebate obligations paid to customers 
the following table is an analysis of the roll forward activities for the distributor and customer rebate accruals in thousands balance at beginning balance at of year provisions payments end of year year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates sales and other allowances 
we estimate a provision for defective reagent discs as part of sales allowances when we issue credits to customers for defective reagent discs 
we also establish  upon shipment of our products to distributors  a provision for potentially defective reagent discs  based on estimates derived from historical experience 
the provision for potentially defective reagent discs was recorded in sales allowances  using internal data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel  the lag time for customers to report defective reagent discs and the historical rates of defective reagent discs 
the balances related to sales allowance for defective reagent discs at march   and were   and  respectively 
starting on july   the provision for potentially defective reagent discs is recorded as part of warranty reserves  instead of sales allowances  since we replace defective reagent discs rather than issue a credit to customers 
changes in our estimates for accruals related to provisions for defective reagent discs have not been material to our financial position or results of operations 
in the future  the actual defective reagent discs may exceed our estimates  which could adversely affect our financial results 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of the amounts owed to us by our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
we specifically identify amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted accordingly 
an additional allowance is recorded based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  using historical experience to estimate the potential uncollectible and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating income 
fair value measurements 
effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
to measure the fair value of our financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas no 
are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
as of march   we used level assumptions for our cash  cash equivalents  certificates of deposits and corporate bonds  which are traded in an active market 
the valuations are based on quoted prices of the underlying security that are readily and regularly available in an active market  and accordingly  a significant degree of judgment is not required 
level directly or indirectly observable market based inputs used in models or other valuation methodologies 
as of march   we did not have any level financial assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and require the use of significant management judgment 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
as of march   we did not have any level financial assets or liabilities 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are developed to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
warranty reserves 
we provide for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligation on our instruments 
our standard warranty obligation on instruments ranges from two to three years 
the estimated contractual warranty obligation is recorded when the related revenue is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our estimated accrual for warranty exposure is based on historical experience  estimated product failure rates  material usage and freight incurred in repairing the instrument after failure and known design changes 
a provision for defective reagent discs is recorded when related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of revenues 
prior to july   we primarily issued a credit to customers for defective reagent discs and  therefore  the provision for estimated costs for defective reagent discs  which includes the replacement costs and freight of a defective reagent disc  was recorded as part of sales and other allowances 
starting on july   the provision for defective reagent discs is recorded as part of warranty reserves  since we replace defective reagent discs rather than issue a credit to customers 
we analyze the adequacy of the ending accrual balance of warranty reserves each quarter 
the determination of warranty reserves requires us to make estimates of the expected costs to repair or replace the instruments and to 
table of contents replace defective reagent discs under warranty 
if actual repair or replacement costs of instruments or replacement costs of reagent discs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of revenues may be required 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximates actual costs using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor and overhead 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our operating income 
valuation of long lived assets 
the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment and amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we look to current and future profitability  as well as current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount 
if impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts to be recovered 
effective april   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our policy to include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes did not change despite the adoption of fin share based compensation expense 
effective april   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  for those shares over the requisite service period of the award to employees and directors 
we did not grant stock options during fiscal  or for stock options granted prior to march   we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires highly subjective assumptions  as described below 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected stock price volatility we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
expected term we estimate the expected term of stock options granted based on historical exercise and post vesting termination patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
expected dividends we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future  consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 

table of contents for restricted stock units  the assumptions to calculate compensation expense is based on the fair value of our stock at the grant date 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
as required by sfas no 
r  employee share based compensation expense recognized is calculated over the requisite service period of the awards and reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical data of our share based awards that are granted and cancelled prior to vesting and upon historical experience of employee turnover 
changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant  unanticipated increases or decreases in share based compensation expense from period to period 
to the extent we revise our estimate of the forfeiture rate in the future  our share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
the adoption of sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal had a material impact on our earnings per share and on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal  and  and we expect that it will materially impact our consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future 
the impact of sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial results is disclosed in note  share based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statement in this annual report on form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes with respect to our short term and long term investments and line of credit 
our investment objective is to invest excess cash in cash equivalents and in various types of investments to maximize yields without significantly increased risk 
at march   our short term investments totaled million  consisting of certificates of deposits and our long term investments totaled million  consisting of certificates of deposits and corporate bonds 
historically  our investment portfolio had included auction rate securities  which became illiquid as a result of the negative condition in the global credit markets 
in september  the bank where our auction rate securities were held  reached agreements with the financial industry regulatory authority  the state of michigan attorney general and the michigan office of financial and insurance regulation regarding the repurchase of auction rate securities 
in october  we received a commitment from our bank to repurchase all of our remaining auction rate securities  which repurchases were completed in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we redeemed million of our auction rate securities at of par value 
as of march   we no longer hold any auction rate securities 
we have the ability to hold the certificates of deposits and corporate bonds in our investment portfolio at march  until maturity and therefore  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our total investment balances at march  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we have not experienced any significant loss on our investment portfolio during either fiscal or fiscal for our line of credit  which provides for borrowings of up to million  the interest rate is equal to the bank s prime rate minus  which totaled at march  consequently  an increase in the prime rate 
table of contents would expose us to higher interest expenses 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in the prime rate applied to our line of credit balance at march  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as there was no amount outstanding on our line of credit at march  as a matter of management policy  we do not currently enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
in the event we do enter into such transactions in the future  such items will be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we operate primarily in the united states and a majority of our revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and capital purchasing activities for fiscal were transacted in us dollars 
however  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the hematology instruments and hematology reagent kits purchased from diatron medical instruments plc  which are primarily denominated in euros 
in the first quarter of fiscal  operations from our sales office in darmstadt  germany were stated in euros and translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rates 
in july  the germany sales office was incorporated as our wholly owned subsidiary  abaxis europe gmbh  to market  promote and distribute diagnostic systems for medical and veterinary uses 
abaxis europe gmbh s functional currency is in us dollars 
foreign currency transactions of the our subsidiary are remeasured into us dollars at the end of period exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities  and historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets 
accordingly  the effects of foreign currency transactions  and of remeasuring the financial condition into the functional currency resulted in foreign currency gains and losses  which were included in interest and other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro currency  the translation of the foreign currency denominated transactions may result in reduced cost of revenues and operating expenses 
similarly  our cost of revenues and operating expenses will increase if the us dollar weakens against the euro currency
