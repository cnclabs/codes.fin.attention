item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the year ended december   was one of transition 
as previously discussed  on august   we completed the sale of the hmo to the humana plan 
the sale resulted in a gain of approximately million and we incurred termination and stay bonus costs of approximately million 
following the sale  the company operates only the psn segment 
the operating results for include the results of operations of the hmo through august  after that date  as a result of the ipa agreement  we began providing services to the members of the hmo through the psn 
similar to the central florida and south florida humana agreements the pre existing humana network agreements  under the ipa agreement  the psn is paid by humana a percentage of the premium received by humana from cms for each humana participating customer  also called a capitation fee 
medical costs incurred under the pre existing humana network agreements and the ipa agreement are included in the medical expenses of the psn 
the humana agreements are risk agreements under which the psn receives monthly payments per humana participating customer at a rate established by the humana agreements 
in accordance with the humana agreements  the capitation fee is a function of the premiums received from cms for humana participating customers  regardless of the actual costs of covered services 
to the extent that the humana participating customers require more or costlier care than is anticipated  aggregate capitation fees may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with the treatment of such customers 
if medical expenses exceed our estimates  except in very limited circumstances  we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under these contracts during the then current terms 
since under the ipa agreement  which was executed concurrent with the sale of the hmo  we receive a percentage of the cms premium received by humana instead of the entire amount we were receiving from cms when operating the hmo  we will realize less per customer revenue for the hmo members than we would have if we had continued to operate the hmo 
in addition  during the last four months of that the ipa agreement was in effect  we did not realize any substantial medical cost savings 
these factors  when taken together  negatively impacted our gross profit and our ratio of medical expense to revenue mer in we anticipate that  as a result of humana s existing contracts with various service providers  the ipa agreement will assist the psn to reduce the cost of providing certain services to the hmo s members 
we believe that it may take another quarter or more to realize a substantial portion of these projected cost savings 
however  as a result of the sale  in the last four months of we realized a reduction in monthly operating costs associated with the hmo 
during the fourth quarter of  our operating costs were approximately million per month less than substantially all of our revenue was directly or indirectly derived from premiums generated by medicare advantage health plans 
as a result  our revenue and profitability are dependent on government funding levels for medicare advantage programs 
see item description of business medicare  the medicare modernization act 
in  approximately of our revenue came from the humana agreements 
the hmo generated of our revenue with fee for service revenue through the psn making up the balance 
we believe that in  substantially all of our revenue will come from the humana agreements 
the hmo s revenue was generated by premiums consisting of monthly payments per customer that were established by the cms contract through the competitive bidding process 
the hmo contracted directly with cms and was paid a monthly premium payment for each customer enrolled in the hmo 
among other things  the monthly premium varied by patient  county  age and severity of health status 
relatively small changes in our mer can create significant changes in our financial results 
accordingly  the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported ibnr claims  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
see item a 
risk factors for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements 
actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  including those that are perceived to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require complex and or subjective judgments by management 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies include use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables and use of estimates  deferred tax asset 
use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables 
our revenue is primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is paid to us monthly and varies depending on the county  age and severity of illness of the humana participating customer 
we assume the economic risk of funding our customers healthcare services and related administrative costs 
premium revenue is recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive healthcare services 
because we have the obligation to fund medical expenses  we recognize gross revenue and medical expenses associated with the humana agreements in our consolidated financial statements 
we record healthcare premium payments we receive in advance of the service period as unearned premiums 
periodically we receive retroactive adjustments to the premiums paid to us based on the updated health status of our customers known as a medical risk adjustment or mra score 
the factors considered in this update include changes in demographic factors  risk adjustment scores  customer information and adjustments required by the risk sharing requirements for prescription drug benefits under part d of the medicare program 
in addition  the number of customers for whom we receive capitation fees may be retroactively adjusted due to enrollment changes not yet processed  or not yet reported 
these retroactive adjustments could  in the near term  materially impact the revenue that has been recorded 
we record any adjustments to revenue at the time the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is available and the collectibility of the amount is reasonably assured 
medical expenses are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
we develop our estimated medical claims payable by using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  care provider contract rate changes  medical care consumption and other medical expense trends 
the actuarial process and models develop a range of projected medical claims payable and we record to the amount within the range that is our best estimate of the ultimate liability 
the actual liability incurred could differ materially from the amount recorded 
each period we re examine previously established medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as the estimate of medical claims payable recorded in prior periods become more exact  we adjust the amount of our liability estimates  and include the changes in such estimates in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our medical expenses payable are adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on claims experience to date and various assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts recorded 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements and risk factors a failure to estimate incurred but not reported pending adoption of an accounting pronouncement on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r statement no 
r which replaces fasb statement no 
 business combinations statement no 

statement no 
r fundamentally changes many aspects of existing accounting requirements for business combinations 
it requires  among other things  the accounting for any entity in a business combination to recognize the full value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at the acquisition date  the immediate expense recognition of transaction costs  and accounting for restructuring plans separately from the business combination 
statement no 
r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
statement no 
r retains the guidance in statement no 
for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
if we enter into any business combination after the adoption of statement no 
r  a transaction may significantly impact our financial position and earnings  but not cash flows  compared to acquisitions prior to the adoption of statement no 
r 
the adoption of statement no 
r is effective beginning in and both early adoption and retrospective application are prohibited 
in december  fasb statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
was issued by the fasb 
statement no 
amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it also amends certain of arb no 
s consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of statement no 
r  business combinations 
statement no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations and other contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payment due by period contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations service agreements employment obligations accrued termination costs of hmo administrative services agreement as of december   we had no outstanding long term debt and no payment obligations that would constitute capital lease obligations 
impact of inflation inflation has a significant impact on the cost of medical care 
according to a report issued in february by the office of the actuary at cms  healthcare outlays are projected to grow at a rate of in  in and at an annual average rate of over the period through the principal projected drivers for this growth include continued cost increasing medical innovation  inflation  continued strong demand for prescription drugs and the aging baby boomer demographic 
we seek to minimize the impact of these increases by developing fixed fee or capitation arrangements with our healthcare providers that run for multiple years and which include built in price increases that are more in line with the projected increases in medicare reimbursement  which we are estimating to be approximately annually 
comparison of and summary during and through august   we operated two financial reporting segments  the psn business and the hmo business 
on august   we sold the hmo and subsequently only operated the psn business 
for  we realized revenue of million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of approximately million or 
medical expenses for were million  an increase of million or over our mer increased to in compared to in income before income taxes for was million compared to million in income before income taxes in includes a gain on the sale of the hmo of million and stay bonus and terminations costs associated with the sale of million 
the million difference between the gain on the sale and the stay bonus and termination costs is equivalent to approximately per share  basic and diluted  of our outstanding common stock 
the psn reported a segment gain before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for  compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the hmo segment incurred a loss before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for  compared to a loss of million in  a decrease of 
allocated overhead was million and million for and  respectively 
the segment information above excludes the gain on the sale and the related stay bonus and termination costs 
net income for was million compared to million for net earnings per share  basic was and net earnings per share  diluted was for compared to net earnings per share  basic of and net earnings per share  diluted of for customer information the table set forth below provides i the total number of customers to whom we were providing healthcare services through the psn and hmo as of december  and and ii the aggregate customer months for the psn and the hmo during and customer months are the aggregate number of months of healthcare services we have provided to our customers during a period of time 
following the sale of the hmo and consummation of the related ipa agreement  the customer base of the hmo was assumed by the psn 
customers at december customer months in percentage change in customer months between years psn hmo total at february   the psn was providing services to approximately  customers 
the increase in the number of customers is due to net new customers added during the current open enrollment period 
this amount will change as customers may enroll and disenroll through march  the increase in total customer months for as compared to is primarily a result of the following growth in the number of hmo customers  resulting primarily from the enrollment of new customers during the enrollment period that commenced november  and ended march   the assumption by our psn  on december   of the management of five south florida physician practices not previously affiliated with the psn  which included approximately  humana medicare advantage customers  hmo enrollments during a special enrollment period that occurred in the summer of for customers of a competing medicare advantage plan that had its contract terminated by cms in july  and the net effect of new enrollments and disenrollments  deaths  customers moving from the covered areas  customers transferring to another physician practice or customers making other insurance selections  offset by a reduction of approximately customers in south florida from a psn practice that we closed in august  all of which were moved to other providers outside of the psn 
revenue the following table provides a breakdown of our sources of revenue 
year ended december increase decrease change psn revenue from humana psn fee for service revenue total psn revenue percentage of total revenue hmo revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue the psn s most significant source of revenue during both and was the premium revenue generated pursuant to the humana agreements the humana related revenue 
the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately million or 
approximately million of the increase in the humana related revenue is attributable to the ipa agreement pursuant to which we began providing services to the customers of the hmo following its sale to the humana plan 
the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to a increase in the psn s per customer per month pcpm premium in as compared to this pcpm premium increase is primarily a result of an increase in the base premium in and an additional premium as a result of an increase in the average medicare risk score of our customers 
the base premium rate in  excluding any potential change attributable to the current medicare risk score of our customers  will increase between and 
premiums paid to us are retroactively adjusted based on the updated health status of our customers known as a medicare risk adjustment or mra 
we record an estimate of the retroactive mra premium that we expect to receive in subsequent periods 
at december   we have recorded million receivable representing our estimate of the retroactive mra premium for that we expect to receive in the summer of the final and retroactive mra premium adjustments  which were received in and  respectively  were not materially different than the estimates we had recorded for those years 
the payment we receive for providing prescription drug benefits the medicare part d payment is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare the estimated prescription drug benefit costs the estimated costs to actual incurred prescription drug benefit costs the actual costs 
to the extent the actual costs exceed the estimated costs by more than the risk corridor  we may receive additional payments 
conversely  to the extent the estimated costs exceed the actual costs by more than the risk corridor  we may be required to refund a portion of the medicare part d payment 
the final settlement for the part d program occurs in the subsequent year 
at december   we estimated that we may be required to refund approximately  related to medicare part d payments received and recorded a liability for this amount 
based upon cms final determination of the actual costs of the psn for providing prescription drug benefits in and  we recorded additional revenue in the third quarter of both and of approximately million  representing the amount by which our and year end estimated part d refund liability exceeded the final amount 
the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana customers in our owned physician practices 
revenue for the hmo was million in as compared to million in the decrease in revenue of million is primarily attributable to the fact that the hmo was sold as of august  and  accordingly  the results of operations for reflect eight months of revenue 
this decrease was partially offset by an overall increase in the hmo s customer base and monthly revenue in as compared to total medical expense total medical expense represents the estimated total cost of providing patient care and is comprised of two components  medical claims expense and medical center costs 
medical claims expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
medical claims expense includes such costs as inpatient and outpatient services  pharmacy benefits and physician services by providers other than the physician practices owned by the psn collectively non affiliated providers 
medical center costs represent the operating costs of the physician practices owned by the psn 
we develop our estimated medical expenses payable by using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial process develops a range of estimated medical expenses payable and we record to the amount in the range that is our best estimate of the ultimate liability 
each period  we re examine previously recorded medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as medical expenses recorded in prior periods becomes more exact  we adjust the amount of the estimate  and include the change in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our estimated medical expenses payable is adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on our claims experience to date and various management assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amount recorded 
total medical expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our reported mer increased from in to in approximately million or of our total medical expenses in are attributable to medical claims expense 
in  approximately million or of our total medical expenses were attributable to medical claims expense 
the balance was the expenses associated with operating our medical centers 
medical costs and mer are as follows year ended december  hmo psn consolidated hmo psn consolidated estimated medical expense for the year  excluding prior period claims development favorable unfavorable prior period medical claims development in current year based on actual claims submitted total reported medical expense for the year medical expense ratio for year in the table above  favorable adjustments to amounts we recorded in prior periods for estimated claims payable appear in parentheses while unfavorable adjustments do not appear in parentheses 
favorable adjustments reduce total medical expense for the respective applicable period and unfavorable claims development increases total medical expense for the applicable period 
because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  medical claims expense includes the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by non affiliated providers 
during  the psn s medical claims expense increased by approximately million or  primarily as a result of the psn s provision of services to the hmo s customers under the ipa agreement and higher medical costs associated with our psn customers increasing medical needs as reflected in the higher average risk scores of our customers in the mer for the psn increased to in as compared to in during the period subsequent to the sale of the hmo  we did not realize any substantial medical cost savings for services provided under the ipa agreement  which negatively impacted our gross profit and our mer for the period subsequent to the sale 
since  under the ipa agreement we receive a percentage of the cms premium received by humana instead of the entire amount we were receiving when operating the hmo  we also realized less revenue in the last four months following the sale of the hmo than we would have if we had continued to operate the hmo 
the combination of these factors increased the consolidated mer for the psn in by 
we anticipate that  as a result of humana s existing contracts with various service providers  the ipa agreement will ultimately assist the psn in reducing the cost of providing certain services to the former hmo s 
we believe that it may take another quarter or more to realize a substantial portion of these projected cost savings 
medical center costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of the psn s employed health professionals and staff providing primary care services  as well as the costs associated with the operations of those practices 
approximately million of our total medical expenses in related to physician practices we own as compared to million in the mer for the hmo declined to in from in this decline is primarily a result of our ability to renegotiate certain contracts with hospitals and outpatient service providers in  which reduced the amount we paid for services  improvements in our medical management techniques  and higher premiums from cms attributable to an increase in the base rate and increased risk scores 
total medical expense for the hmo in decreased by million over that incurred in primarily due to the fact that the hmo was sold effective august  and  accordingly  the results of operations for include only eight months of total medical expense 
the mer is impacted by both revenue and expense 
retroactive adjustments of prior period premiums that are recorded in the current period impact the mer of the current period 
if the retroactive adjustment increases revenue of the period then the adjustment reduces the recorded mer 
conversely  if the retroactive adjustment reduces revenue of the period  then the mer for the period is higher 
these retroactive adjustments include  among other things  the mid year and annual risk score premium adjustments and settlement of part d program premiums 
in addition  actual medical claims expense usually develops differently than estimated during the period 
therefore  the mer shown in the above table will likely change as additional claims are submitted 
favorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods developing lower than the original estimated cost which reduces the reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
unfavorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods exceeding the original estimated cost which increases total reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
for the psn  a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately million impacts the psn s mer by in and a change of approximately million impacts the psn s mer by in the estimated medical expense payable for the psn at december  was determined to be between million and million and  as is our policy  we recorded a liability of million  which approximates the actuarial mid point of the range 
at december   our estimated medical expenses payable for the psn was million 
claims paid in for totaled million  a favorable variance of  this  difference decreased the psn s medical expense in and decreased the psn s mer by 
at december   our estimated medical expense payable for the hmo was million 
claims paid in for totaled million which was less than the estimated accrual by  this difference was recorded as a reduction in claims expense in and reduced the hmo s mer by 
operating expenses year ended december decrease increase change administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue marketing and advertising percentage of total revenue stay bonuses and termination costs percentage of total revenue restructuring expense percentage of total revenue total operating expenses administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits include salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative and sales staff 
for  administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits were million  compared to the million for  a decrease of  the decrease is primarily a result of a million decrease in payroll cost associated with the hmo  primarily as a result of the sale of the hmo 
the decrease was partially offset primarily by an increase in the psn s payroll costs  most of which related to the increase in personnel that was needed to manage the increased number of customers serviced under the ipa agreement 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased to million in as compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
general and administrative costs associated with the hmo decreased million in as compared to  primarily as a result of the sale of the hmo 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the general and administrative costs of the psn  most of which related to the increase in the number of customers serviced under the ipa agreement 
marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense  which primarily consists of advertising expenses and brokerage commissions paid to independent sales agents of the hmo  was million in as compared to million in  a decrease of 
the primary reason for this decrease is the elimination of these costs upon the sale of the hmo as a significant portion of our marketing costs were incurred during the open enrollment period  which occurs in the last quarter of the year 
stay bonuses and termination costs in connection with the sale of the hmo  we paid the employees of the hmo stay bonuses to seek to ensure that the hmo business would operate normally during the period between the signing of the stock purchase agreement and the closing date and to encourage employees to assist with a smooth transition to humana 
in addition  we made termination payments to certain hmo employees to recognize their past services to the company 
we recognized and paid all of these costs  totaling million  in the third quarter of restructuring expense in july  we implemented a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
the restructuring plan  completed by the end of august  resulted in the closure of two of the hmo s office locations  one psn medical practice  and a workforce reduction involving employees 
in connection with this plan  we recorded approximately  of restructuring costs during the third quarter of  including approximately  for severance payments  approximately  for continuing lease obligations on closed locations and approximately  for the write off of certain leasehold improvements and equipment 
at the time of its closure on july   the psn medical practice served approximately customers in south florida  all of which were moved to other providers outside of the psn 
prior to its closing on july  this psn medical practice generated approximately million of revenue in and had a negative gross margin 
of the  restructuring charge  approximately  related to the hmo with the balance of  associated with the psn 
gain on sale of hmo subsidiary in  we sold all of the outstanding capital stock of our hmo to the humana plan pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement  dated as of june   for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the hmo of approximately million 
the sale price of the hmo is subject to positive or negative post closing adjustment based upon the difference between the hmo s estimated closing net equity  which was approximately million  and the hmo s actual net equity as of the closing date as determined nine months following the closing date 
the ultimate settlements  if any  will increase or decrease the gain on the sale of the hmo 
other income we realized other income of  in compared to million in although we did realize positive investment income in  investment income did decrease by million compared to this was a result of a significant decline in interest rates and realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio of approximately  during during the market volatility of  we maintained a significant amount of our funds in cash and cash related investments 
we invested a portion of our cash in bond and money market funds and we did realize a decline in the market value of these investments 
in october  we engaged asset managers to assist us in the investment of our funds and we meet regularly with these managers to evaluate our holdings 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest our funds in highly liquid securities 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in the higher effective income tax rate in is a result of adjusting deferred tax estimates related to the hmo 
comparison of and summary we operated in two financial reporting segments  the psn business and the hmo business in both and for  we realized revenue of million compared to million in  an increase of approximately million or

at the time of its closure on july   the closed psn practice served approximately humana participating customers in south florida  all of which were moved to other providers outside of our psn 
the growth in the number of hmo customers resulted primarily from the enrollment of new customers during the enrollment period that commenced november  and ended march  revenue the following table provides a breakdown of our sources of revenue 
year ended december increase decrease change psn revenue from humana psn fee for service revenue total psn revenue percentage of total revenue hmo revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue the psn s most significant source of revenue during both and was the humana related revenue 
the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in the humana related revenue is primarily attributable to premium increases and the increase in the medicare risk score attributable to the humana participating customers 
the psn s pcpm premium in was as compared to in  an increase of 
this premium increase was partially offset by a decrease in humana participating customer months from  in to  in  which lowered humana related revenue by approximately million 
the decline in humana participating customer months in from was partially a result of the closing of the closed psn practice in august and customer attrition due to deaths  relocations and transfers to other insurance plans 
the final retroactive mra premium increase from cms  which was received in  was not materially different than the estimate we had recorded for that year 
in  cms approved a retroactive increase in the psn s mra score for and which resulted in retroactive payments in of  at december   we estimated that we would be required to refund million to cms under the medicare part d program for prescription drug costs incurred during accordingly  we reduced revenue in and accrued a liability for the million at december  in  based on the final determination by cms of medicare part d costs incurred by the psn in  we recorded additional revenue of approximately million  representing the amount by which our year end estimate exceeded the final settlement amount 
the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana customers in our owned physician practices 
revenue for the hmo was million in as compared to million in the increase in revenue in is primarily attributable to the increase in our customer months during and a increase in the pcpm premium in as compared to total medical expense total medical expense represents the estimated total cost of providing patient care and is comprised of two components  medical claims expense and medical center costs 
medical claims expense for both the psn and hmo are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes

favorable adjustments reduce total medical expense for the respective applicable period and unfavorable claims development increases total medical expense for the applicable period 
because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  medical claims expense includes the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by non affiliated providers 
the mer for the psn decreased to in as compared to in during  the psn realized the benefit of the various medical management techniques implemented in to improve the medical management of our customers 
we believe that the impact of these techniques is a primary reason for the psn s reduced mer 
the psn s medical claims expense increased by approximately million or  primarily as a result of higher medical costs associated with our psn customers increasing medical needs as indicated by the higher risk scores in medical center costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of the psn s employed health professionals and staff providing primary care services  as well as other costs associated with the operations of those practices 
approximately million of our total medical expenses in related to physician practices we own as compared to million in the mer for the hmo declined to in from in this decline is primarily a result of our ability to renegotiate certain contracts with hospitals and outpatient service providers in that reduced the amount we paid for services provided 
in addition  during  the hmo made improvements to the pre approval process for medical services provided to the hmo s customers and enhanced medical management processes 
partially as a result of these efforts  we realized a decrease in the per customer medical expense cost 
total medical expense for the hmo in increased by million over that incurred in primarily as a result of the increased customer months in the mer is impacted by both revenue and expense 
retroactive adjustments of prior period premiums that are recorded in the current period impact the mer of that period 
if the retroactive adjustment increases revenue of the period then the impact reduces the recorded mer 
conversely  if the retroactive adjustment reduces revenue of the period  then the mer for the period is higher 
these retroactive adjustments include  among other things  the mid year and annual risk score premium adjustments and settlement of part d program premiums 
in addition  actual medical claims expense usually develops differently than estimated during the period 
therefore  the mer shown in the above table will likely change as additional claims development occurs 
favorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods developing lower than the original estimated cost which reduces the medical expense and the mer for the current period 
unfavorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods exceeding the original estimated cost which increases total medical expense and the mer for the current period

intangible asset risk we have intangible assets and perform goodwill impairment tests apart from the required annual impairment test of goodwill whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
we evaluate the continuing value of goodwill by using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings  revenue  ebitda ie  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization particularly with regard to entities similar to us that have recently been acquired 
we also consider the market value of our own stock and those of companies similar to ours 
as of december  we believe our intangible assets  including goodwill  which fully relates to the psn  are recoverable  however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
