item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview greenhill is an independent investment banking firm that i provides financial advice on significant mergers  acquisitions  restructurings and similar corporate finance matters as well as fund placement services for private equity and other financial sponsors and ii manages merchant banking funds and similar vehicles and commits capital to those funds and vehicles 
we act for clients located throughout the world from offices in new york  london  frankfurt  toronto  tokyo  dallas  san francisco and chicago 
our activities constitute a single business segment with two principal sources of revenue financial advisory  which includes engagements relating to mergers and acquisitions  financing advisory and restructuring  and fund placement advisory  and merchant banking  which includes the management of outside capital invested in the firm s merchant banking funds and other similar vehicles  primarily greenhill capital partners gcp i  greenhill capital partners ii gcp ii  greenhill capital partners europe gcp europe  and greenhill sav partners gsavp together with gcp i  gcp ii and gcp europe  the greenhill funds  and the firm s principal investments in the greenhill funds and other merchant banking funds and similar vehicles 
historically  our financial advisory business has accounted for the majority of our revenues  and we expect that to remain so for the near to medium term 
however  there have been periods  such as the second quarter of and the first quarter of  in which the revenues of our merchant banking business outweighed our financial advisory revenues 
since the initial public offering  our financial advisory business has generated of total revenues and our merchant banking and other business has generated approximately of our total revenue 
the main driver of the financial advisory business is overall mergers and acquisitions  or m a  and restructuring volume  particularly in the industry sectors and geographic markets in which we focus 
we have recruited and plan to continue to recruit new managing directors to expand our industry sector and geographic coverage 
we expect these hires will over time  add incrementally to our revenue and income growth potential 
in total  we recruited managing directors in  increasing our managing director count on a net basis by 
this group of experienced bankers brings us sector expertise in health care devices  health care services  industrials  paper forest products and telecom  new offices in san francisco  tokyo and chicago  and a new fund placement advisory business 

table of contents the principal drivers of our merchant banking revenues are management fees paid by the funds and realized and unrealized gains on investments and profit overrides  the size and timing of which are tied to a number of different factors including the performance of the particular companies in which we invest  general economic conditions in the debt and equity markets and other factors which affect the industries in which we invest  such as commodity prices 
at december   we had three merchant banking funds which are actively investing and we have assets under management in those funds of billion 
in addition  in early we completed a million initial public offering of ghlac  a special purpose acquisition company  in which we invested approximately million 
in september ghlac announced an agreement to acquire iridium  a leading provider of voice and data mobile satellite services and in october  the firm completed a million investment in iridium 
our revenues can fluctuate materially depending on the number and size of completed transactions on which we advised  the number and size of our merchant banking gains or losses and other factors 
accordingly  the revenues in any particular year may not be indicative of future results

net income and revenues in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 
financial advisory revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of 
at the same time  worldwide completed m a volume decreased by  from  billion in to  billion in 
since july the financial markets have experienced a sharp contraction in credit availability and global m a activity 
recent levels of capital markets volatility and an uncertain macroeconomic outlook have further contributed to a volatile and uncertain environment for evaluating many assets  securities and companies  which may lead to a more difficult environment for m a activity 
because we earn a majority of our financial advisory revenue from fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a merger  acquisition  restructuring or similar transaction or the closing of a fund  our financial advisory business has been negatively impacted and may be further impacted by a reduction in m a activity 
we believe  however  that our simple business model as an independent  unconflicted adviser  in a period of the bankruptcy or merger of many of our larger banking focused competitors  will create opportunities for us to attract new clients and provide us with excellent recruiting opportunities to further expand our industry expertise and geographic reach 
merchant banking and other revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of 
consistent with the difficult economic and market environment in  our merchant banking portfolio experienced disappointing results 
we avoided extraordinary losses through more modest use of leverage than the typical merchant banking fund 
current weak economic and financial conditions should provide attractive opportunities to invest the substantial committed but unspent capital that remains in our merchant banking funds 
adverse changes in general economic conditions  commodity prices  credit and public equity markets could impact negatively the amount of financial advisory and merchant banking revenue realized by the firm

our list of clients with whom there is a currently active revenue generating engagement changes continually 
we gain new clients each year through our business development initiatives  by recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from chief executives  directors  attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships 
at the same time  we lose clients each year as a result of the sale or merger of a client  a change in a client s senior management  competition from other investment banks and other causes 
a majority of our financial advisory revenue is contingent upon the closing of a merger  acquisition  restructuring or similar transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  failure to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  failure to secure necessary financing  failure to achieve necessary regulatory approvals and adverse market conditions 
in certain client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  we earn a significant portion of our revenue in the form of 
table of contents retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment but are not necessarily linked to the end result 
we do not allocate our financial advisory revenue by type of advice rendered m a  financing advisory and restructuring  fund placement or other because of the complexity of the assignments for which we earn revenue 
for example  a restructuring assignment can involve  and in some cases end successfully in  a sale of all or part of the financially distressed client 
likewise  an acquisition assignment can relate to a financially distressed target involved in or considering a restructuring 
finally  an m a assignment can develop from a relationship that we had on a prior restructuring assignment  and vice versa

we charge management fees in gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe to all investors except the firm 
in gcp i  we charge management fees to all outside investors who are not employed or affiliated with us 
management fees are generally charged based upon a percentage of committed capital ranging from to during the year commitment period and as a percentage of invested capital 
table of contents ranging from to after the termination of the commitment period 
our management fees also include portions of other transactions fees which may be paid directly to us by portfolio companies of the merchant banking funds 
we currently earn annual fees from gcp ii of approximately million  and we expect to earn such amount through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 
we currently earn annual fees from gsavp of approximately million  and we expect to earn such annual amount through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 
we earned fees from gcp europe of approximately million in and we expect to earn the same or a slightly higher annual amount through or such earlier time as the commitment period terminates and a lesser amount thereafter 
the amount of management fees earned from a fund after the termination of the commitment period will decline because our fee percentage is lower and is based upon invested capital  which will decrease as the investments are liquidated 
for  we expect to earn approximately million in management fees from gcp i 
we recognize revenue on investments in merchant banking funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such funds on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we recognize the consolidated earnings of the general partners of these funds in which we have a majority economic interest  offset by allocated expenses of the funds 
to the extent we make other principal investments  we will also recognize revenue based on the realized and unrealized gains or losses from such investments on a quarterly basis 
we record our investments at estimated fair value 
the value of our fund investments in privately held companies is determined on a quarterly basis by the general partner of the fund after giving consideration to the cost of the security  the pricing of other sales of securities by the portfolio company  the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company  purchase multiples paid in other comparable third party transactions  the original purchase price multiple  market conditions  liquidity  operating results and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
discounts are generally applied to the funds privately held investments to reflect the lack of liquidity and other transfer restrictions 
investments held by our merchant banking funds as well as those held directly by us in publicly traded securities are valued using quoted market prices discounted for any contractual restrictions on sale 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations as well as the discounts applied  the estimated fair values of investments in privately held companies may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
the values at which our investments are carried on our books are adjusted to estimated fair value at the end of each quarter and the volatility in general economic conditions  stock markets and commodity prices may result in significant changes in the fair value of the investments from quarter to quarter 
significant changes in the estimated fair value of our investments may have a material effect  positive or negative  on our revenues and thus our results of operations 
as the general partner of our merchant banking funds  we make investment decisions for the funds and are entitled to receive from the funds an override of the profits of the funds after certain performance hurdles are met 
in aggregate  we and our employees are entitled to a profit override percentage of of the profits  to the extent they exceed certain performance hurdles  earned by investors other than the firm in gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe 
we are deemed to have the majority of the economic interest in the managing general partner of gcp i and the general partners of gcp ii  gsavp  gcp europe in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r effective for investments made beginning early 
under fin r we include as consolidated revenue all realized and unrealized profit overrides earned by the managing general partners of gcp i for all investments made after january   gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe 
from an economic perspective  profit overrides in respect of such investments are allocated to the firm and to employees of the firm 
the economic share of the profit overrides allocated to the employees of the firm is recorded as compensation expense 
the amount of profit overrides we recognize as revenue will depend upon the underlying fair value of each portfolio company and is subject to the volatility referred to above 
we recognize merchant banking profit overrides when certain financial returns are achieved over the life of the fund 

table of contents profit overrides are generally calculated as a percentage of the profits over a specified threshold earned by such fund on investments managed on behalf of unaffiliated investors for gcp i and principally all investors other than the firm for gcp ii  gcp europe and gsavp 
the profit overrides realized by the firm during the period through relate to gcp i 
as of december   we have not recognized profit overrides from our investments in gcp ii  gcp europe and gsavp 
we calculate the amount of merchant banking profit overrides  if any  on an accrual basis at the end of each period by measuring the profit on each investment over a specified financial return threshold for each investment fund 
at june  we exceeded the profit threshold in gcp ii and we entered the catch up adjustment phase for the profit override  which entitled us to record percent of the gain until we reached percent of the total gain on our investment 
at september  we no longer exceeded the profit threshold in gcp ii and the previously recognized but unrealized profit override was reversed 
at december   we remained below the profit threshold for each of gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe 
overrides are generally calculated on a deal by deal basis but are subject to investment performance over the life of each merchant banking fund 
we may be required to repay a portion of the overrides to the limited partners of the funds in the event a profit override has been realized and paid to the general partner and a minimum performance level is not achieved by the fund as a whole we refer to these potential repayments as clawbacks 
we would be required to establish a reserve for potential clawbacks if we were to determine that the likelihood of a clawback is deemed probable and the amount of the clawback can be reasonably estimated 
during a portion of the accrued profit overrides for gcp i were reversed 
as of december   we had unrealized profit overrides of million related to gcp i 
we have not reserved for any clawback obligations because we do not believe the likelihood of a clawback is probable 
in september ghlac announced an agreement to acquire iridium  a leading provider of voice and data mobile satellite services and in october  greenhill completed a million investment in iridium 
the acquisition of iridium is subject to stockholder approval  various regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions 
if the acquisition of iridium is completed on the agreed terms and our investment is converted to common shares without any adjustment to the conversion price  the firm will own approximately million common shares amex ghq and million warrants amex ghq 
ws  exercisable at per common share  of the combined company 
while we can provide no assurances that the transaction will receive stockholder approval and the various regulatory approvals required or that the parties will satisfy the various other closing conditions  if consummated the transaction could provide a significant source of additional merchant banking revenue after completion 
in the event that ghlac is unable to consummate a business combination prior to february  we will write off our investment of approximately million in ghlac made at the time of its initial public offering 
versus for the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking and other revenue compared to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease principally resulted from a decline in the fair market value of merchant banking funds and reversal of overrides accrued in prior periods in gcp i  offset by slightly higher asset management fees resulting from greater assets under management 
during gcp and the firm recognized gains from nine of our portfolio companies and recorded losses on eighteen portfolio companies

versus for the year ended december   the firm earned million in merchant banking and other revenue compared to million in  a decrease of

the investment gains or losses in our investment portfolio may fluctuate significantly over time due to factors beyond our control  such as individual portfolio company performance  equity market valuations  commodity prices and merger and acquisition opportunities 
revenue recognized from gains or losses recorded are not necessarily indicative of revenue that may be realized and or recognized in future periods 
operating expenses our total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  which compares to million of total operating expenses for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  principally reflects a decrease in compensation expense which is described in more detail below 
the pre tax income margin was in and in we classify operating expenses as compensation and benefits expense and non compensation expenses 
management does not separately evaluate operating expenses by financial advisory and merchant banking activities 
operating expenses apart from compensation have been modest in proportion to revenues  as a result of the relatively small number of staff and related costs including travel  office space  communications  information services  depreciation  professional services and interest expense that the firm bears 
a portion of certain costs are reimbursed by clients under the terms of client engagements 
in addition  until august  barrow street capital subleased office space from us and reimbursed us for the use of other facilities and participation in our health care plans 
the following table sets forth information relating to our operating expenses  which are reported net of reimbursements of certain expenses by our clients and merchant banking portfolio companies for the year ended december  in millions  except employee data number of employees at year end employee compensation and benefits expense of revenues non compensation expense of revenues total operating expense of revenues minority interest in net income loss of affiliates total income before tax pre tax income margin 
table of contents compensation and benefits the principal component of our operating expenses is compensation and benefits expense 
it is our policy that our total compensation and benefits  including that payable to our managing directors and senior advisors  will not exceed of total revenues each year although we retain the ability to change this policy in the future 
the actual compensation expense ratio is determined by management in consultation with the compensation committee and based on such factors as the relative level of revenues  the anticipated compensation requirements which may vary depending on the level of recruitment of new managing directors in any given period and other factors  and the level of other costs and expenses 
the compensation we pay to our employees consists of base salary and benefits  annual incentive compensation payable as cash bonus awards and long term incentive compensation awards of restricted stock units 
base salary and benefits are paid ratably throughout the year 
cash bonuses  which are accrued each quarter  are discretionary and dependent upon a number of factors  including the performance of the firm and are paid annually in february following year end 
awards of restricted stock units are also discretionary and amortized to compensation expense based upon the value of the award at the time of grant during the service period over which the award vests  which is generally five years 
as we expense these awards  the restricted stock units recognized are recorded within stockholders equity 
in january  our employees were granted  restricted stock units as part of the long term incentive award program 
versus for the year ended december   our employee compensation and benefits expenses were million  which compares to million of compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  the decrease of million or is due to the lower level of revenues in compared to for the year ended december   the ratio of compensation to revenues was  which was the same as versus for the year ended december   our employee compensation and benefits expenses were million  which compares to million of compensation and benefits expense for the year ended december  the increase of million or is primarily due to the higher level of revenues in compared to for the year ended december   the ratio of compensation to revenues was  which was the same as our compensation expense is generally based upon revenue and can fluctuate materially in any particular year depending upon the amount of revenue recognized as well as other factors 
accordingly  the amount of compensation expense recognized in any particular year may not be indicative of compensation expense in a future period 
non compensation expenses our non compensation expenses include the costs for occupancy and rental  communications  information services  professional fees  recruiting  travel and entertainment  insurance  depreciation  interest expense and other operating expenses  including the benefit of foreign currency gains or the expense related to foreign currency losses 
reimbursed client expenses are netted against non compensation expenses 
we expect that our non compensation costs  particularly occupancy  travel and information services costs  will increase as we grow our business and make strategic investments 
versus for the year ended december   our non compensation expenses were million  which compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million or 
the increase is principally related to higher occupancy costs associated with rental rate increases and new office space  increased information service costs primarily attributable to the growth in personnel  and higher interest expense related to greater average short term borrowings  partially offset by the absence of a provisions for legal contingencies in as compared to the same period in

this compares to for the year ended december  the decrease in these expenses as a percentage of revenue in as compared to reflects a small increase in non compensation costs spread over greater revenue 
the firm s non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary as a result of a variety of factors including fluctuation in annual revenue amounts  the amount of recruiting and business development activity  the amount of reimbursement of engagement related expenses by clients  the amount of our short term borrowings  interest rate and currency movements and other factors 
accordingly  the non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue in any particular year may not be indicative of the non compensation expenses as a percentage of revenue in future years 
provision for income taxes we are subject to federal  foreign and state and local corporate income taxes 
in addition  certain of our non us subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their local jurisdictions 
versus for the year ended december   the provision for taxes was million  which reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 
this compares to a provision for taxes for the year ended december  of million  which reflects an effective tax rate of approximately

the increase in the provision for taxes in as compared to principally results from higher pre tax income partially offset by a slightly lower effective tax rate based on the fact that a greater proportion of our pre tax income was earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate can fluctuate as a result of variations in the relative amounts of financial advisory and merchant banking revenue earned in the tax jurisdictions in which the firm operates and invests

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our liquidity position is monitored by our management committee  which generally meets monthly 
the management committee monitors cash  other significant working capital assets and liabilities  debt  principal investment commitments and other matters relating to liquidity requirements 
as cash accumulates it is invested in short term investments expected to provide significant liquidity 
we generate cash from both our operating activities in the form of financial advisory and asset management fees and our merchant banking investments in the form of distributions of investment proceeds and profit overrides 
we use our cash primarily for operating purposes  compensation of our employees  payment of income taxes  investments in merchant banking funds  payment of dividends  repurchase of shares of our stock and leasehold improvements 
our cash balances generally accumulate from our operating activities during the year 
in general  we collect our accounts receivable within days except for certain restructuring transactions where collections may take longer due to court ordered holdbacks 
our liabilities typically consist of accounts payable  which are generally paid monthly  accrued compensation  which includes accrued cash bonuses that are paid in the first quarter of the following year to the large majority of our employees  and taxes payable 
in february  cash bonuses of million relating to compensation were paid to our employees 
in addition  we expect to pay approximately million in early related to income taxes owed for the year ended december  since our initial public offering we have used a portion of our cash reserves to repurchase shares of our common stock  pay dividends and make investments in our merchant banking funds 
our commitments to our merchant banking funds may require us to fund capital calls on short notice 
on the other hand  distributions from our merchant banking funds are generally made shortly after proceeds are received by the funds 
we are unable to predict the timing or magnitude of share repurchase opportunities  capital call requirements or distribution of investment proceeds 
our merchant banking funds typically invest in privately held companies 
the ability of our merchant banking funds to sell or dispose of the securities they own depends on a number of factors beyond the control of the funds  including general economic and sector conditions  stock market conditions  commodity prices  and the availability of financing to potential buyers of such securities  among other issues 
as a result we consider our investments illiquid for the short term 
to provide for working capital needs  facilitate the funding of merchant banking investments and other general corporate purposes we retain a million revolving bank loan facility 
borrowings under the facility are secured by all management fees earned by greenhill capital partners  llc and greenhill venture partners  llc and any cash distributed in respect of their partnership interests in gcp i  gcp ii and gsavp  as applicable 
interest on borrowings is based on the higher of bank of america prime rate or percent 
the revolving bank loan facility matures on december  at december   million of borrowings were outstanding on the loan facility and we were compliant with all loan covenants 
as of december   we had total commitments not reflected on our balance sheet relating to future principal investments in gcp ii  gsavp and gcp europe and other merchant banking and related activities of million 
these commitments are expected to be drawn on from time to time and be substantially invested over a period of up to five years from the relevant commitment dates

it has been our policy to retain approximately of our foreign earnings within our foreign operating units to minimize our global tax burden and to fund our foreign investment needs 
however  in the event our cash needs in the us exceed our cash reserves and

based upon authorization provided by our board of directors we repurchased  shares of our common stock during in open market purchases at an average price of per share 
additionally  during we are deemed to have repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share in conjunction with the payment of tax liabilities in respect of stock delivered to our employees in settlement of restricted stock units 
in november  the firm completed its primary stock offering the primary offering of  common shares 
the offering price was per share  and the company received proceeds  net of underwriting commissions and expenses  of million 
the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving loan bank facility 
we evaluate our cash operating position on a regular basis in light of current market conditions 
our recurring monthly operating disbursements consist of base compensation expense and other operating expenses  which principally include rent and occupancy  information services  professional fees  travel and entertainment and other general expenses 
our recurring quarterly and annual disbursements consist of tax payments  dividend distributions and cash bonus payments 
these amounts vary depending upon our profitability and other factors 
we incur non recurring disbursements for our investments in our merchant banking funds and other principal payments  leasehold improvements and share repurchases 
while we believe that the cash generated from operations and funds available from the revolving bank loan facility will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs  commitments to our merchant banking activities  build out costs of new office space  tax obligations  share repurchases and common dividends  we may adjust our variable expenses and non recurring disbursements  if necessary  to meet our liquidity needs 
in the event that our needs for liquidity should increase further as we expand our business  we may consider a range of financing alternatives to meet any such needs

since the merchant banking commitments can be drawn at any time over the life of the commitment period  the amounts above are shown as if spread ratably over the life of the primary commitment period 
the firm has a revolving loan facility of million to provide for working capital needs  facilitate the funding of short term investments and other general corporate purposes 
borrowings under this facility are secured by all management fees earned by greenhill capital partners  llc and greenhill venture partners  llc and any cash distributed in respect of their partnership interests in gcp i  gcp ii and gsavp  as applicable

market risk we limit our investments to short term cash investments  which we believe do not face any material interest rate risk  equity price risk or other market risk and principal investments made in gcp  gsavp  gcp europe and other merchant banking funds and ghlac  iridium and related investments 
we have invested our cash in short duration  highly rated fixed income investments including treasury bills and money market funds 
changes in interest rates and other economic and market 
table of contents conditions could affect these investments adversely  however  we do not believe that any such changes will have a material effect on our results of operations 
we monitor the quality of these investments on a regular basis and may choose to diversify such investments to mitigate perceived market risk 
our short term cash investments are primarily denominated in us dollars  canadian dollars  pounds sterling and euros  and we face foreign currency risk in our cash balances held in accounts outside the united states due to potential currency movements 
to the extent that the cash balances in local currency exceed our short term obligations  we may hedge our foreign currency exposure 
with regard to our principal investments including  to the extent applicable  our portion of any profit overrides earned on such investments  we face exposure to changes in the estimated fair value of the companies in which we and our merchant banking funds invest  which historically has been volatile 
significant changes in the public equity markets and credit market may have a material effect on our results of operations 
volatility in the general equity markets would impact our operations primarily because of changes in the fair value of our merchant banking or principal investments that are publicly traded securities 
volatility in the availability of credit would impact our operations primarily because of changes in the fair value of merchant banking or principal investments that rely upon a portion of leverage to operate 
we have analyzed our potential exposure to general equity market risk by performing sensitivity analyses on those investments held by us and in our merchant banking funds which consist of publicly traded securities 
this analysis showed that if we assume that at december   the market prices of all public securities were lower  the impact on our operations would be a decrease in revenues of million 
we meet on a quarterly basis to determine the estimated fair value of the investments held in our merchant banking portfolio and to discuss the risks associated with those investments 
the respective investment committees manage the risks associated with the merchant banking portfolios by closely monitoring and managing the types of investments made as well as the monetization and realization of existing investments 
in addition  the reported amounts of our revenues may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between the euro  pound sterling and canadian dollar in which currencies of our revenues for the year ended december  were denominated and the dollar  in which our financial statements are denominated 
we do not currently hedge against movements in these exchange rates 
we analyzed our potential exposure to a decline in exchange rates by performing a sensitivity analysis on our net income 
because of the strengthening in value of the dollar relative to the pound sterling and euro in on a weighted average basis  our earnings in were lower than they would have been had the value of the dollar relative to those other currencies remained constant 
however  we do not believe we face any material risk in respect of exchange rate movements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following discussion addresses greenhill s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments

we believe that the estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates
