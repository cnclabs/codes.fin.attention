we also explain our current strategy and the qualitative results we have experienced 
finally  we attempt to give you a look at our company through the eyes of management so that you can assess the financial condition and results of operations of our company in a quantitative fashion 
the discussion that follows should give you information that will help you understand our business and its performance 
we intend for the discussion to be clear and to explain the drivers of our results so that you can assess the quality of our earnings and the predictability of our future results 
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and operating results includes hillenbrand  inc hillenbrand and batesville services  inc together with its subsidiaries  batesville  currently hillenbrand s only operating business 
background we are the leader in the north american death care industry through the manufacture  distribution  and sale of funeral service products to licensed funeral directors who operate licensed funeral homes 
we sell primarily burial caskets  but also provide cremation caskets  containers  urns  and product merchandising systems that include selection room display fixturing for funeral establishments 
our mission is to provide funeral directors with the highest quality products and services  in a phrase  helping families honor the lives of those they love 
in line with our mission  we provide personalization and memorialization products and services  as well as creating and hosting websites for funeral establishments 
after the close of business on march   we became a separate publicly traded company as the result of the distribution of our shares to the former stockholders of hillenbrand industries  inc now named hill rom holdings  inc and referred to herein as hill rom or former parent  our former parent company 
we have retained the hillenbrand name because of its heritage as a family built business and the close affiliation of that name with batesville and its customers 
the consolidated financial statements included in this form k do not include all expenses that would have been incurred had we been a separate  stand alone entity prior to april   and do not reflect our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows had we been a stand alone company during the periods prior to april  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in part ii  item of this form k 
death care industry trends the death of a family member or loved one causes most people to seek the services of a state licensed funeral director to provide specific services regarding handling and preparing the deceased 
most consumers have only limited familiarity with funeral related products and usually expect funeral directors to provide information on product and service alternatives 
although caskets and urns can be purchased from a variety of sources  including directly from internet sellers and casket stores  the overwhelming majority of those who arrange a funeral purchase these products directly from the funeral home as a matter of choice and convenience 
demographics and consumer preferences 
for the past several years the total number of deaths in north america where most of our products are sold has been relatively flat 
during the same period the rate of cremation selection has been slowly but steadily increasing to the point where cremations as a percentage of total deaths now represent more than one third in the united states and more than one half in canada 
these consolidated factors have yielded a slow but steady decline in the total number of casketed deaths in north america 
the current trends are expected to continue for the foreseeable future until the post wwii spike in births causes an increase in deaths 
while the primary driver of market size is population and age  the actual number of deaths and  therefore  the actual number of caskets sold is affected by a variety of additional factors  including improving healthcare and the varying timing and severity of seasonal pneumonia and influenza outbreaks 
the unpredictability of these factors can cause periodic fluctuations in industry demand patterns and revenue generated in any given fiscal period 
while it is difficult to predict precisely the number of deaths on a month to month or even a year to year basis  we anticipate that the number of deaths in north america will remain relatively flat and the cremation rate will continue to gradually increase  resulting in a modest  but steady decline in the demand for burial caskets for the foreseeable future 

table of contents along with the declining number of casketed deaths  the casket industry has experienced a long term gradual decline in the product mix of burial caskets sold  a trend that has also affected our financial results 
one of the factors that has affected mix is the pricing practice of many funeral homes to place most of the margin expectation on the sale of products instead of the services provided 
however  we are observing changes in the pricing practices of many funeral homes  wherein they are recovering margin on their services and reducing the mark up of products  primarily caskets 
additionally  more consumers are expecting higher levels of personalization  both in products and services 
our response to this changing consumer preference is described below 
competition 
competition in the casket industry is based on product quality  design features  personalization  price  and delivery service 
we compete in the sale of burial and cremation containers with several national casket manufacturers distributors  regional manufacturers distributors  and more than independent casket distributors  most of whom serve fairly narrow geographic segments 
the industry also has seen a few foreign manufacturers  mostly from china  import caskets into the us and canada 
additionally  some retail stores  and internet retailers sell caskets directly to consumers  although we believe that total sales among this latter group are a minor portion of annual burial casket volume 
most recently  wal mart has entered the market and has begun selling caskets online 
initially  it appears that wal mart is testing this product offering online  but not in stores 
however  it is too early to estimate the impact wal mart might have on the industry 
the effect of gradually declining casket demand has resulted in economic pressures on casket manufacturers and distributors as they seek to maintain volume by increasing market share 
the industry has approximately twice the necessary domestic production capacity  which further increases these pressures 
additionally  our costs associated with commodities used in our manufacturing processes have increased significantly  resulting in higher per unit costs 
many established manufactures and distributors have responded to these competitive pressures by increasing discounts to obtain volume 
over the past decade  funeral homes have sought to minimize their inventory costs by shifting the inventory burden to their suppliers 
today  many funeral homes maintain minimal casket inventory and expect their casket suppliers to provide same day or next day delivery to satisfy their funeral requirements 
our high velocity distribution system enables us to meet these customer expectations with lower inventory investment per dollar of sales 
this system enables us to deliver the majority of our volume  including uniquely personalized caskets  within hours of receiving the customer s order 
over the last three years  we delivered the right casket at the right time in excess of of the time 
we believe this highly effective distribution system is aligned with the increasing time demands of families and the inventory reduction expectations of our customers 
industry consolidation 
the underlying industry trends are leading to consolidations  acquisitions  and partnerships among casket manufacturers and distributors 
in the past several years  two of the larger casket manufacturers have merged and several independent distributors have been acquired 
over the past four years  we acquired two small regional distributors 
we continue to be interested in the possibility of acquiring high quality distributors and will remain selective in this process 
the demographic and economic pressures that have been driving consolidations among casket manufacturers and distributors have also been driving consolidations among funeral homes 
recently  we have seen regional funeral home operators expanding through selected acquisitions 
we responded to this trend early in fiscal by establishing a dedicated sales team focused on this regional consolidator customer segment 
since that time  we have increased the resources devoted to this area  and we believe our efforts have been successful in obtaining the majority of this group as customers 
in fiscal  we plan to continue our marketing efforts to this regional group and expand our efforts to other key accounts that have not been fully penetrated 
as funeral homes continue to consolidate and operate multiple locations  we believe that our competitive advantages and value proposition will be able to serve these new customers best 

table of contents costs of raw material and energy 
the primary raw materials used in our products include steel  wood  and red metals ie  copper and bronze 
although the key materials have fluctuated in price from time to time  current economic conditions are such that we expect that we will continue to be affected by the volatility in costs of raw materials and other commodities used in production over the next few years 
in addition  we have exposure to prices we pay for diesel fuel primarily through our distribution operations 
increases in diesel prices have also impacted our operations in the form of surcharges on many of our materials and services used in production 
we generally do not engage in hedging transaction with respect to raw material purchases  but do enter into some fixed price supply contracts 
these contracts generally are aligned with near term production needs and  with few exceptions  do not obligate us to any material non cancelable commitments in the long term 
additionally  our wide use of lean business principles has enabled us to reduce waste in many areas of our business 
we intend to continue our focus on operational improvement  using practices based on the toyota production system  to better serve our customers  increase efficiencies  improve quality  and reduce costs 
strategy and results in an industry that has historically been recognized as recession resistant  the severity of the current economic recession  combined with a relatively mild influenza and pneumonia season in  has challenged us to take a closer look at additional ways we can continue to build shareholder value 
for many years  we have seen a relatively flat number of deaths and a consistent increase in cremations  resulting in a steady decline in burials 
the economy in further affected the cremation rate  drove product mix down  and we are uncertain about the long term impact of these changes in customer behavior 
in addition  the volatility in commodity prices and the lack of consistent data about the upcoming flu season have made our ability to predict future performance less certain 
in the process of developing our business strategy for fiscal  we recognized that our strategy  approach and actions in fiscal have been reasonably successful in maintaining our market position  even when faced with challenging industry and economic conditions 
with some modifications discussed below  our existing long term hillenbrand strategy has been reaffirmed 
we believe we can deliver increasing revenue and earnings streams by building a strong  diversified enterprise with strong positions in multiple growth oriented industries 
our long term value creation strategy consists of maintaining and building upon our leading position in the death care industry through batesville consisting of batesville services  inc and its subsidiaries  deploying acquisition capabilities that form the basis of our growth platform and enable us to acquire and integrate new businesses  and continuing to invest in our people  building a strong base of talent to help us successfully execute our acquisition and business strategies 
maintain and build on batesville s industry leadership our batesville business is the leader in the death care industry  primarily in the production and distribution of burial caskets and cremation products 
while volume growth in the burial casket space is limited  there are still opportunities to generate additional business within a wider range of funeral services 
leadership of this operating division is focusing on four categories of strategic initiatives to drive this growth 

table of contents optimize core burial business for the long term the batesville brand is widely recognized as the premier brand in the industry among funeral professionals  offering the broadest range of metal and wood caskets 
our legacy of innovation and leadership in the funeral industry has allowed our customers and the families they serve to commemorate the lives of those they love through quality construction and compelling designs that provide personal expressions of a life well lived 
to enhance our leadership position  we will continue to invest in our marketing capabilities  specifically in research  new product development  and brand promotion 
the landscape of casket manufacturers has dwindled over the years  but there are opportunities to capitalize on acquisitions and alliances in other parts of the death care space 
we will continue to remain alert to these opportunities and capitalize on them when it s prudent to do so 
we have responded to the consolidation trend in our industry and the growth of regional funeral home consolidators by creating a sales team that differentially serves customers whose business spans multiple sales territories 
we have been successful in developing new customer relationships with many of these regional customers by demonstrating the value our batesville branded products and services can bring to their operations and the families they serve 
in fiscal  we will apply this same approach to other less penetrated large key accounts that operate multiple funeral homes within a single geographical area 
in addition  we are focused on improving the quality of our sales organization through better call management and compensation alignment 
our ability to apply proven merchandising principles and proprietary database tools enables us to help our customers increase their average mix and drive greater profitability  all while increasing the satisfaction of their clients 
in  we began to focus on moving customers farther up the merchandising ladder  emphasizing the value of using our full system 
fully merchandised accounts not only had a higher rate of revenue growth than customers at lower levels of implementation  but also have a higher retention rate 
grow profitable revenue streams outside the core burial casket business our options by batesville product line consists of cremation caskets  containers  urns  and other cremation products 
we expect continued growth in these product lines as more consumers choose cremation over burial 
in fiscal  we established a dedicated sales and marketing team to focus on developing new products and services for these consumers 
based upon that knowledge  in fiscal we will implement a number of new initiatives aimed at improving revenue performance through new product introductions  increased customer margin per call  customized package solutions and after market programs for our funeral home customers 
batesville is the largest provider of funeral home websites in the world  a service that many small  family owned funeral homes would not otherwise spend the time and money to develop on their own 
in  we will provide funeral directors with additional ways to generate revenue streams and connect grieving families that may be geographically dispersed 
through batesville interactive we offer integrated online products that include weblink  tributelink online videos  and obitlink  an alliance with legacy 
com that will give funeral directors access to the largest networked obituary system in the nation 
fiscal was our third full year offering the northstar product line to independent casket distributors  and we continue to be satisfied with our progress 
these are private label burial caskets manufactured in our existing facilities using distinctive tooling 
because these products do not contain any of the batesville proprietary features  designs  or specs they are differentiated from the premium batesville brand 
based on our success in this small product line  we do not anticipate any changes to this strategy 
improve cost structure our leadership position as the largest manufacturer and distributor of caskets and containers in north america provides scale and scope 
we intend to continue to utilize our scale and scope to enable us to capitalize on our efficiencies and compete with a low cost structure 
our highly integrated manufacturing facilities in the united states and mexico employ pull production and one piece flow to feed our high velocity replenishment system with products quickly and efficiently to meet the growing time demands of our customers and their client families 
we intend to continue to leverage our processes to allow us to carry less inventory per sales dollar than our competitors  enabling customers to carry few or no products in their funeral homes  and still achieve on time delivery more than of the time 
our effective execution of hillenbrand lean business derived from the toyota production system enables further cost reductions in our operations  distribution and administrative functions 

table of contents execute our acquisition strategy we intend to use our strong cash flows  culture of execution  and core competencies in manufacturing  distribution  and lean business practices to create an enterprise with strong positions in multiple growth oriented businesses 
this will reduce our reliance on the number of burials as our primary source of revenues 
ideally  we are targeting companies that have revenues in excess of million  demonstrated profitable growth  established sales and marketing capabilities  a strong business to business brand  and a capable management team 
we are targeting one or more acquisitions over the next few years with purchase prices aggregating several hundred million dollars 
we are committed to being a disciplined buyer and will continue to be discriminating in our evaluations of potential acquisition targets 
continue to invest in people the foundation of our success has always been our people  and we have a long history at batesville and now in the hillenbrand enterprise of hiring  developing and retaining successful  multi functional leaders 
our talent management process helps us to identify and develop our people through exposure to lean business principles  participation in strategic projects  and planned multifunctional assignments allowing us to meet the management and talent requirements of our business strategy 
we intend to build upon our current team  and also attract and develop a diverse group of people who can continue carrying out our strategy 
we plan to selectively add operating and analytical talent in order to have the necessary management strength available for acquisitions as needed 
results of operations the following table presents comparative operating results for the fiscal years discussed in detail below amounts in millions of dollars year ended year ended year ended september  of september  of september  of revenues revenues revenues net revenues cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses excluding separation costs separation costs operating profit interest expense investment income and other income before income taxes income tax expense net income fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue our net revenues for the year were down from the same period last year  decreasing million or 
burial unit volume decreased or million compared to the same period last year and was the primary contributor to our reduction in net revenue  although improved volume on non burial products helped limit the impact 
we believe this volume decrease was attributable to a lower number of reported deaths year over year  increased cremation rates  and aggressive price competition 
we suspect the higher than anticipated increase in cremation rates was fueled by the economic recession  which in turn caused the aggressive price competition for the remaining volume 
offsetting this impact was an increase in our average selling price  which contributed million to revenue 
we believe that our merchandising initiatives and new product launches helped improve average selling prices and slow the downward trend in product mix  especially in locations that used the batesville merchandising system 
finally  we also experienced the unfavorable impact of currency fluctuations during the year from a stronger us dollar  mainly compared to the canadian dollar 
this resulted in decreased revenue of million over the prior year 
we can t predict how currency rates will move either to help or hurt our results in the future 

table of contents cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold decreased million  or  including a million decrease largely attributable to lower burial unit volume 
in our manufacturing operations  we experienced cost increases over fiscal year of million related primarily to higher commodity costs  most notably on carbon steel and red metals 
an aggregate cost decrease of million was attributable to a number of other categories across our manufacturing activities  primarily driven by employee benefit costs that were partially offset by reduced prices we were paid for our production scrap 
in our distribution operations  we benefited from a million reduction in fuel cost as compared to the prior year 
we also experienced a million decrease in other distribution cost categories which were mainly related to lower employee benefit costs in similar fashion to our manufacturing operations 
we are continuing to execute lean business initiatives to further optimize our costs 
operating expenses our operating expenses increased million  or  excluding one time separation costs 
we are better able to analyze our operating cost structure without non recurring effects of the separation 
in fiscal we realized a million decrease in our bad debt expense as a result of collecting a customer balance that had previously been nearly fully reserved causing this year s expenses to be relatively higher 
this increased expense was offset by a decrease in variable sales compensation and benefits of million tied to our lower revenues and a decrease of million in legal fees related to our antitrust lawsuit 
the remaining decrease in our core operating expenses of million was attributable to other components of batesville s operating expense categories 
during fiscal  we substantially completed building teams and processes to support ourselves as a new  stand alone public company 
we also initiated our acquisition strategy and have put in place people  processes and resources to enable successful execution of the strategy 
as a result of these activities  we incurred an increase of million in hillenbrand corporate operating costs during fiscal year as compared to the previous year 
this increase was partially offset by the fact that we are no longer being allocated corporate costs from hill rom which ceased at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 
these allocated costs decreased by million compared to last year 
thus our corporate costs were million higher than last year 
separation costs in fiscal year  we incurred or were allocated million in separation costs associated with the separation of the company from hill rom 
included in these non recurring costs were million tied to the acceleration of previously unvested stock grants  million in stock option modification charges  and million of investment banking and advisory fees 
the balance of the costs represented primarily legal and professional fees 
interest expense as fiscal marked our first full year as a stand alone public company  we incurred a full year of financing costs under our credit facility 
these costs have since decreased 
we have been paying down the credit facility since the time of the separation and have experienced lower interest rates on the balances that were outstanding during fiscal the weighted average interest rate of the credit facility was and during the fiscal years and  respectively 
investment income other as was the case with interest expense described above  we incurred a full year of investment earnings or losses from assets that were transferred to us by hill rom at the time of the separation 
during fiscal year  net losses from investments in affiliates limited partnership investments were million due to write downs within the affiliates investment portfolios 
in comparison  we had no net earnings or losses from these investments in fiscal however  in the last quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million other than temporary impairment loss on an investment in common stock 
we earned higher interest income of million  in aggregate  on the auction rate securities ars and note receivable from forethought financial group  inc forethought as compared to the prior year due to the fact that we held them for only six months last year 
we also received a right the put from ubs financial services ubs that allows us to sell a portion of our existing ars in the future 
since that time  we have been recording changes in the fair value of the put and applicable ars through our income statement and as expected  they essentially offset 
please see the discussions within the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k and other liquidity matters included within liquidity and capital resources discussed below 

table of contents income taxes our income tax rate for the year was  which was lower than last year 
this reduction was primarily due to separation costs we incurred in the prior year that were not deductible for income tax purposes and a partial disallowance of the domestic production activities deduction in the prior year due to the separation 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue our net revenues for fiscal were up slightly  increasing million or  from the same period in the previous year 
burial unit volume decreased or million compared to the previous year  despite the favorable volume impact in the second quarter of fiscal due to the more typical flu season 
this favorable volume impact was more than offset by the lost volume in the third quarter that resulted when the yorktowne acquisition attempt was discontinued late in the third quarter of fiscal year and yorktowne ceased purchasing our products 
this was followed by weaker fourth quarter sales in fiscal compared to the previous year due to reduced sales initiatives 
offsetting this unfavorable effect was an increase in our average selling price which contributed million to revenue 
finally  we experienced the favorable impact of currency fluctuations during fiscal from a weaker us dollar  mainly compared to the canadian dollar  resulting in increased revenue of million over the previous year 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased million  or  net of a million decrease largely attributable to lower burial unit volume 
in our manufacturing operations  we experienced cost increases over the same period in the prior year of million related to higher commodity costs  primarily carbon steel and red metals 
these cost increases were offset by higher prices we received for production scrap and other manufacturing cost decreases aggregating to million 
in our distribution operations  we experienced increased fuel costs of million and a million aggregate increase across other distribution categories 
operating expenses our core operating expenses decreased million  or  excluding separation costs  over the prior year 
within our core batesville operating expenses  we experienced a decrease of million because of acquisition costs  legal costs  and certain receivables that we expensed when we discontinued our effort to acquire yorktowne in fiscal year we also experienced a decrease in legal fees related to the antitrust lawsuits of million from the prior year 
as previously discussed  during fiscal we recorded a million reduction in our bed debt 
these favorable effects were offset by increased incentive compensation  variable sales compensation and benefits  and employee benefit costs  all aggregating to million 
an aggregate increase of million was attributable to other components of batesville s operating expense categories 
as discussed earlier  in fiscal year we began to incur incremental costs associated with building our corporate infrastructure  along with the costs of retirement related obligations to certain former hill rom employees we assumed in connection with the separation 
these activities resulted in million of additional operating expenses primarily related to adding staff to support our separate company operations over the prior year 
the effect of these new costs was offset by the fact that  beginning with the third quarter of fiscal  we were no longer being allocated corporate costs by hill rom 
as a result  these allocated costs were lower by million compared to fiscal 
table of contents separation costs see earlier discussion for an understanding of the nature of these costs 
interest expense and investment income other we began to incur interest expense when we borrowed million on our credit facility and paid the proceeds to hill rom as part of the separation at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year investment income and other was up over the prior year as we began to realize returns from investments that were transferred to us on march   in connection with the separation 
we earned interest income of million primarily on cash  auction rate securities  and the note receivable from forethought 
as previously noted  we also recorded a million other than temporary impairment loss on an investment in common stock in the last quarter of fiscal income taxes our income tax rate for the year was  which was higher than the prior year 
this was primarily due to separation costs we incurred in the second quarter of fiscal that were not deductible for income tax purposes and an increase in the valuation allowance on state credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources we believe the ability to generate cash is critical to the value of the company 
in this section  we tell you about our ability to generate and access cash to meet our business needs 
first  we will describe our actual results in generating and utilizing cash by comparing the last three years 
we will also talk about any significant trends we are seeing to help you understand how this could impact us going forward 
second  we will tell you about how we see operating  investing  and financing cash flows being impacted for the next months 
while it s not a certainty  we will tell you where we think cash will come from and how we intend to use it 
we will also talk about significant risks or possible changes to our thinking that could change our expectation 
third  we will tell you about other significant matters that could affect our liquidity on an ongoing basis 
a summary of our cash flows for the last three years is as follows amounts in millions of dollars fiscal year ended september  cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase in cash and cash equivalents also includes net cash and cash equivalents provided to our parent company prior to separation on march  operating activities historically  net cash flows from operating activities have represented our primary source of funds for the growth of our business 
prior to our separation from hill rom  cash flows from operating activities were fairly stable  generally following the pattern of our overall net income 
this pattern is now less correlated as we incur non cash related expenses such as stock based compensation and non cash earnings such as interest income on our note receivable from forethought  and make our own income tax and pension payments as a separate public company 
interim periods can also be more volatile individually as they are affected to a greater degree by the seasonality of our revenues 

table of contents our operating cash flow was million higher in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the noteworthy changes in its components were as follows we incurred million more in separation costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  substantially all of which were paid by the end of the period 
this reduced both our profitability and our operating cash flow in fiscal cash payments for income taxes decreased million from fiscal year  including amounts paid to or received from hill rom to settle our pre separation income tax obligations 
this change was the result of the timing between when we had made these payments to hill rom prior to separation and the timing of when we now make them directly to tax authorities as a separate company 
we paid million more in defined benefit plan contributions in fiscal year as compared to the prior year resulting from a discretionary payment of million made this year 
we made this payment in order to improve the funding level of our plans 
the significant items that help explain the change in our operating cash flows from fiscal year to fiscal year in the table above are as follows we incurred or were allocated an additional million in separation costs in fiscal over fiscal  substantially all of which were paid by the end of the period 
this unfavorability affected both our profitability and our cash flow 
we paid approximately million primarily related to establishing our own corporate infrastructure in fiscal corporate infrastructure costs were somewhat offset by the million reduction of corporate costs we paid hill rom in fiscal compared to prior year 
we made a million discretionary payment to fund one of our pension plans in the second half of fiscal investing activities our net investing activities in fiscal year were essentially flat from the prior year 
the modest change was due to cash invested in and returned from investment assets we received in connection with the separation 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year decreased from the prior year due to lower capital spending of million  along with the fact that some of the investments transferred to us at the time of separation returned capital of million during the last six months of fiscal year in addition  million of the reduction to our fiscal year investing activities resulted from cash outlays related to business acquisitions paid for in fiscal year financing activities prior to our separation  our only financing activity was to provide the excess cash we generated to hill rom as part of a centralized treasury management process 
as a separate company  we now have our own treasury management system and have a million revolving credit facility in place to finance business operations 
in connection with the separation on march   we borrowed million on the credit facility and used these funds to settle and distribute amounts to hill rom 
this distribution  along with other advances earlier in fiscal year  resulted in net distributions to hill rom of million 
just prior to the separation  hill rom transferred million in cash to us 
a final payment of million was received from hill rom in the third quarter of fiscal year during our initial six months as a stand alone company third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we utilized available cash on hand and operating cash flows to repay million of the credit facility borrowings and pay cash dividends of million 
during fiscal year  we borrowed million to finance short term business needs and paid an additional million on the facility  along with cash dividends of million 
on july   our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the amount of repurchase activity will depend on a variety of factors including the level of cash generated from operations  the market price of our stock  repayments we elect to make on the credit facility  and the use of cash from operations in support of other business growth opportunities 
during fiscal year  we elected to purchase million shares of our common stock for million 
in fiscal year  we purchased an additional million shares for million 

table of contents month outlook operating activities at the present time  we expect the future profitability of batesville to drive our net operating cash flow 
the specifics that follow are known factors that can introduce volatility to that general premise 
during fiscal year  our pension asset values fluctuated significantly due to the volatility of the market 
by september   our pension assets had actually generated a modest increase in fair value prior to considering the million discretionary contribution we made during the fiscal year 
although it didn t impact our cash flow  the annual revaluation of our defined benefit obligations caused us to increase the liabilities on our balance sheet by million  all of which was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of tax 
that increase was substantially driven by a decrease in the discount rate used to value the obligations 
although the discount rate does not have an immediate cash flow impact  it does mean that we expect to record defined benefit plan expenses in fiscal of nearly double the amount we incurred during fiscal based upon our latest analysis  we anticipate making an additional discretionary contribution of approximately million to our plans during fiscal to improve funding levels 
this contribution is above the current minimum requirement 
these amounts could change depending on changes in plan asset values over the next months 
any contributions we make will reduce our net cash flow from operations 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this k  during fiscal we expect to receive the first annual interest payment of million on our note receivable from forethought  assuming that forethought does not exercise its right to deferral under certain conditions 
this payment will increase our net cash flow from operations 
see other liquidity matters below for more information 
during fiscal  we anticipate setting aside assets for past and current participants in certain of our deferred compensation arrangements in the form of funded rabbi trusts 
although the company will continue to own the assets  the participants will be able to direct the investments  and our obligation to the participants will be limited to the investments in the trusts 
based upon the deferred compensation obligations as of september   that funding would be million 
this funding  and any additional amounts we contribute to the trusts on behalf of the participants in the future  will reduce our net cash flow from operations 
as discussed under part i  item a  risk factors as it relates to a potential adverse outcome in the ongoing antitrust litigation in which we are a defendant  we are currently exposed to the possibility of significant legal expenditures as a result of that matter 
since recent developments have been favorable to us  our exposure to  and expectation of  these costs is much lower than it has been in the past 
should there be a change in direction toward resolution of that matter  our legal costs could increase significantly over the million we incurred in fiscal for information regarding the risks we face  see the discussion under part i  item a  risk factors in this form k 
investing activities we are continuing to move forward with our acquisition strategy 
as previously announced  we intend to utilize business acquisitions to increase the annual growth rate of our revenues and earnings 
we are targeting one or more acquisitions over the next few years with purchase prices aggregating several hundred million dollars 
however  any acquisition timetable depends on whether suitable opportunities are available 
the timing or success of any acquisition effort cannot be predicted 
we expect to fund future acquisitions primarily with cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents we expect to utilize the put to liquidate our ubs auction rate securities at par value million at september  during fiscal year see other liquidity matters below for more information 
this will result in a significant cash inflow from investing activities 
we can be called upon by our private equity limited partnership investments to provide additional investment funds  the maximum amount being million in the aggregate 
financing activities in december we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to per common share 
in fiscal we plan on paying cash dividends that will require about million each quarter based on our outstanding common stock at september  we may use additional cash generated by the business to pay down our revolving credit facility  depending on our working capital needs 
in fact  during october  we paid down the credit facility another million 
as discussed under investing activities  we may utilize availability under the revolving credit facility to finance acquisitions 
we may also continue purchasing additional shares of our common stock  depending on market conditions 
summary of month outlook we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  and cash available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  and financing obligations 
other liquidity matters at september   we held million in a portfolio of ars consisting of highly rated tax exempt state and municipal securities  the majority of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program recorded at fair value 
we have estimated the current fair value of the portfolio using information provided by our investment advisors with expertise in valuing these securities  considering current liquidity limitations  interest rate risk  and the credit worthiness of the borrower  among other factors 
the risk exists that the various valuation models utilized by our investment advisors will not reasonably predict the actual price necessary to attract interested buyers for these securities 
as of september   the underlying securities in the portfolio consisted of creditworthy borrowers with aaa or a debt ratings 
market conditions and auction failures have adversely impacted the liquidity of these securities 
the continuing effect of these conditions has led us to conclude that an orderly conversion of the portfolio into cash will likely be beyond september  although we expect the put discussed further below to allow us to complete the liquidation of a portion of the ars in july 
accordingly  we are classifying million of these securities as non current 
if current market conditions do not improve  or worsen  we may not be able to readily convert these securities to cash  and our earnings could suffer as a result 
in november we received a put from ubs that allows us to sell approximately million of our existing auction rate securities carrying value at september  at par value million at september  plus accrued interest 
the put has a carrying value based upon an estimated fair value of million as of september  we may exercise the put at anytime during the period of june   through july  additionally  ubs may redeem these securities at par value plus accrued interest at any time prior to expiration at their discretion 
we currently expect to utilize the put to liquidate the applicable ars position 
we have classified this portion of our ars portfolio as a component of current assets for the year ended september  although we are not dependent on any cash flows from our note receivable from forethought the note to fund our operating activities  we regularly evaluate the note for impairment based upon collectability 
if  based upon these evaluations  it is probable that the note will not be paid in accordance with its terms  it will be deemed impaired 
based upon information available to us regarding conditions existing on or prior to september   the note is not impaired 
we estimate the fair value of the note based upon a comparison to debt securities currently trading in an active market with similar characteristics of yield  duration  and credit risk  adjusted for liquidity considerations 
we estimate that the fair value of the note and related interest receivable has increased from million at september   to million at september  this increase in estimated fair value was caused by the natural decline in the period to maturity closer to the collection date  and it was offset by an increase in the required yield to maturity discount rate observed in the marketplace on comparable debt instruments adjusted for a liquidity premium 
the model used in estimating the fair value of the note primarily utilizes market data and is not intended to imply that some or all of the future payments due under the note will not be collected when due from forethought 

table of contents in march  we established a million five year revolving credit facility the facility with a syndicate of banks 
the term of the facility expires in march borrowings under the facility bear interest at variable rates  as defined therein 
the availability of borrowings under the facility is subject to our ability at the time of borrowing to meet certain specified conditions 
these conditions include compliance with covenants contained in the credit agreement governing the facility  absence of default under the facility  and continued accuracy of certain representations and warranties contained in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda each as defined in the credit agreement of not more than and a ratio of consolidated ebitda to interest expense of not less than the proceeds of the facility may be used i for working capital and other lawful corporate purposes and ii to finance acquisitions 
as of september   we i had million outstanding  undrawn letters of credit under the facility  ii were in compliance with all covenants set forth in the credit agreement  and iii had complete access to the remaining million of borrowing capacity available under the facility  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments in this section we will tell you about the things we have committed to pay 
this will help give you an understanding of the significance of cash outlays that are fixed beyond the normal accounts payable we have already incurred and have on our books  unless we took some action to delay or cancel the need to pay 
to provide visibility to matters potentially impacting our liquidity position  the following table outlines our contractual obligations as of september  dollars in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred compensation arrangements defined benefit plan funding other long term liabilities capital call arrangements revolving credit facility total contractual cash obligations purchase obligations represent contractual obligations under various take or pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business 
these commitments represent future purchases in line with expected usage to obtain favorable pricing 
also included are obligations related to purchase orders for which we have firm commitments related to order releases under the purchase orders 
the amounts do not include obligations related to other purchase obligations that are not considered take or pay arrangements or subject to firm commitments 
such purchase obligations are primarily reflected in purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations  which we do not believe represent firm purchase commitments 
we expect to fund these commitments with operating cash flows 

table of contents deferred compensation arrangements represent amounts due current and former executives and directors in accordance with elective deferrals 
under our deferred compensation program  deferred amounts can appreciate over time based on the individual s election of either a a variable interest rate equal to the prime rate or b a phantom stock account whose value moves in accordance with the market value of our common stock and dividends paid by us 
we currently expect to set aside sufficient assets to fully fund this obligation through the use of rabbi trusts during fiscal based upon the obligations at september   the funding would require million 
the anticipated funding of the rabbi trusts is not included within the table above 
the defined benefit plan funding represents payments to comply with non discretionary requirements based upon plan funding at september  and excludes our anticipated fiscal discretionary contribution of approximately million 
the anticipated contribution could change depending on market conditions 
other long term liabilities include the forecasted liquidation of liabilities related to our casket pricing obligation  self insurance reserves  and long term severance payments 
we could be called upon by our private equity limited partnership investments to provide additional investment funds  the maximum amount being million in aggregate 
our revolving credit facility expires in march although we may make earlier principal payments at our discretion  we have reflected the principal balance due at expiration in the table above  because that is when we are required to repay 
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  we also have a variety of other agreements related to the procurement of materials and services and other commitments 
we are not subject to any contracts that obligate us to material non cancelable commitments 
while many of these agreements are long term supply agreements  some of which are exclusive supply or complete requirements based contracts  we are not committed under these agreements to accept or pay for requirements which are not needed to meet near term production requirements 
in connection with past acquisition activities  we have entered into certain guarantees and indemnifications of performance with respect to the fulfillment of our commitments under the respective purchase agreements 
the arrangements generally indemnify the seller for damages associated with breach of contract  inaccuracies in representations and warranties surviving the closing date  and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments retained under the applicable contract 
those representations and warranties which survive closing generally survive for periods up to the maximum period allowed by the applicable statutes of limitations 
guarantees and indemnifications with respect to acquisition activities  if triggered  would not have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  in connection with the separation we entered into a distribution agreement and judgment sharing agreement with hill rom 
if we are required to make any payments to hill rom under the provisions of these agreements  those payments could be substantial and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
critical accounting estimates in this section we tell you about accounting estimates that inherently involve significant judgment on our part 
our accounting policies require management to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
if future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
a detailed description of our accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue for our products is generally recognized upon delivery of the products to the customer  but in no case prior to when the risk of loss and other risks and rewards of ownership are transferred 
net revenues reflect gross revenues less sales discounts  customer rebates  sales incentives  and product returns  all of which require us to make estimates for the portion of these allowances that have yet to be credited or paid to our customers 
we estimate these allowances based both upon historical rates and projections of customer purchases toward contractual rebate thresholds 
allowance for doubtful accounts the accounting for our trade receivables requires us to estimate the net realizable value of these assets 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses and collection risk in our existing trade accounts receivable portfolio 
performing our evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to exercise significant judgment based on historical write off and individual customer collection experience 
as a result  our historical experience and current trends we are using in our estimates at any point in time may not be indicative of the collectability of these balances in the future 
auction rate securities and related put right the accounting for our auction rate securities requires us to estimate the fair value of these assets  currently in an environment where there is not an active market to easily establish that value 
as a result  we have estimated the current fair value of the portfolio with information provided by our banks with expertise in valuing these securities  considering current liquidity limitations  interest rate risk  and the credit worthiness of the borrower  among other factors 
the risk exists that the various valuation models utilized by the banks will not reasonably predict the actual price necessary to attract interested buyers for these securities 
if we were forced to try to liquidate these securities under current market conditions  we would likely have to sell them at a steep discount  resulting in losses from the sale 
we are not currently planning to sell these securities under current market conditions  but our plans could change in the future 
note receivable from forethought we evaluate the note receivable from forethought for impairment based upon collectability 
if  based upon this evaluation  it is probable that the note will not be paid in accordance with its terms  the note will be deemed impaired 
performing an impairment evaluation of the note requires us to exercise significant judgments as to whether forethought has the financial wherewithal to make the scheduled payments based upon events or conditions that we are aware of existing on or prior to the balance sheet date 
the note agreement provides us access to various kinds of financial information from forethought 
we utilize this information to assess the financial strength of forethought and our prospects for getting paid 
the principal under the note is not scheduled to be repaid until as a result  the indicators or trends we consider at any point in time when making an impairment assessment may not be indicative of forethought s ultimate financial strength at the time of scheduled payment 
if we determine an impairment exists  an impairment reserve would be established based upon the then carrying value of the note and the estimated discounted cash flows we would expect to receive on an impaired basis 
making such an estimate would require us to exercise significant judgment about the expected timing and size of the payments under the note in what could be distressed financial conditions at forethought 
even though we might be legally entitled  we would likely cease recording interest income under the note  due to the uncertainty of being paid under these types of conditions 

table of contents liabilities for loss contingencies related to claims and lawsuits the ultimate outcome of claims and lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty 
an estimated loss from these contingencies is recognized when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
making such an estimate requires us to exercise significant judgment 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation 
the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
for a more complete description of loss contingencies related to lawsuits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
legal fees associated with claims and lawsuits are generally expensed as incurred 
upon recognition of an estimated loss resulting from a settlement  an estimate of legal fees to complete the settlement is also included in the amount of the loss recognized 
we are also involved in other possible claims  including product and general liability  workers compensation  auto liability and employment related matters 
outside insurance companies and third party claims administrators establish individual claim reserves and an independent outside actuary provides estimates of ultimate projected losses  including incurred but not reported claims  which are used to establish reserves for losses 
as our actuaries periodically provide us updated ultimate loss projections  we must true up increasing or reducing previously recorded claim reserves 
thus  any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the effect of the true up 
the recorded amounts represent our best estimate of the costs we will incur in relation to such exposures  but it is possible that actual costs could differ from those estimates 
performance based stock compensation the vesting of our performance based restricted stock and units collectively pbus is contingent upon the creation of shareholder value as measured by the cumulative cash returns and final period income in excess of our weighted average cost of capital over a three year period and a corresponding service requirement 
the value of an award is based upon the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
based on the extent to which the performance criteria are achieved  it is possible for none of the awards to vest or for a range up to the maximum to vest  which is reflected in the pbu table in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item  of this form k 
we record expense associated with the awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period based upon an estimate of projected performance 
the actual performance of the company is evaluated quarterly  and the expense is adjusted according to the new projection if it has changed significantly 
as a result  depending on the degree to which we achieve the performance criteria or our projection changes  our expenses related to the pbus may become more volatile as we approach the final performance measurement date at the end of the three years 
this increase in volatility is due to the fact that we must true up increasing or reducing previously recorded compensation expense as the projection of performance changes 
thus any one period s financial results could be significantly affected by the cumulative effect of the true up 
preparing the projection of performance requires us to exercise significant judgments as to the expected outcome of final performance up to three years in the future 
in making the projection  we consider both actual results and probable business plans for the future 
at september   we have recorded cumulative compensation expense associated with unvested pbus of million  which continues to be subject to periodic true ups as the related pbus approach the final performance measurement date 
retirement and postretirement plans we sponsor retirement and postretirement benefit plans covering a majority of employees 
expense recognized in relation to such plans is based upon actuarial valuations 
inherent in those valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected returns on assets  and projected future salary rates 
the discount rates used in the valuation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are evaluated annually based on current market conditions 
in setting these rates we utilize long term bond indices and yield curves as a preliminary indication of interest rate movements 
we then make adjustments to the respective indices to reflect differences in the terms of the bonds covered under the indices in comparison to the projected outflow of our pension obligations 
our overall expected long term rate of return on pension assets is based on historical and expected future returns  which are inflation adjusted and weighted for the expected return for each component of the investment portfolio 
our rate of assumed compensation increase for pension benefits is also based on our specific historical trends of past wage adjustments in recent years and expectations for the future 

table of contents changes in retirement and postretirement benefit expense and the recognized obligations may occur in the future as a result of a number of factors  including changes to any of these assumptions 
our expected rate of return on pension assets is at the end of fiscal and at the end of fiscal and a basis point increase in the expected rate of return on pension assets reduces annual pension expense by approximately million 
the discount rate was decreased to and at the end of fiscal for the pension and post retirement healthcare plan expense  respectively 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate increases the annual pension expense by approximately million 
the impact of this decrease to our post retirement healthcare plan expense would be less than million 
impacts from assumption changes could be positive or negative depending on the direction of the change in rates 
based upon the new rates and assumptions above  we expect the aggregate expense associated with our defined benefit plans to increase from million in fiscal to million in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  for key assumptions and other information regarding our retirement and post retirement benefit plans 
uncertain income tax positions on october   we adopted the accounting standard that prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in assessing the need for reserves for uncertain tax positions  we have to make judgments regarding the technical merit of a tax position  and when necessary  an estimate of the settlement amount based upon what we think is the probability of the outcome 
at september   we had reserves of million established for uncertain tax positions based upon our estimates 
our ability to make and update these estimates is limited to the information we have at any given point in time 
this information can include how taxing authorities have treated the position in the past  how similar cases have settled  or where we are in discussions or negotiations with taxing authorities on a particular issue  among others 
as information available to us evolves  we update our reserves quarterly 
these updates can result in volatility to our income tax rate particularly to a given quarter if new information or developments result in a significant change in our estimate 
business combinations on october   we adopted a new accounting standard that governs how to account for and disclose business combinations eg  when we buy a business 
with a few exceptions  the standard requires that we record the assets and liabilities of the acquired business at estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
estimating fair value for acquired assets and liabilities as part of a business combination typically requires us to exercise judgment  particularly for those assets and liabilities that may be unique or not easily determined by reference to market data 
often estimates for these types of acquired assets and liabilities will be developed using valuation models that require both historical and forecasted inputs  as well as market participant expectations 
thus the valuation is directly affected by the inputs we judge as best under the given circumstances 
when material  we expect to seek assistance of competent valuation professionals when the underlying valuation is more complex or unique 
we anticipate that in most cases  we will exercise significant judgment in estimating the fair value of intangible assets customer lists or relationships  trademarks  etc  for example  contingent liabilities loss reserves  for example  and contingent consideration earn outs  for example 
this list is not exhaustive  but is designed to give you a better understanding of where we think a larger degree of judgment will be required due to the nature of the item and the way it is typically valued 
recently adopted accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard related to fair value measurements 
this standard defined fair value  established a framework for measuring fair value and expanded the disclosure requirements for both financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb delayed for one year the implementation of this new standard for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on at least an annual basis 
this standard as originally issued  became effective for us on october  our adoption of the deferred portion of this standard on october   had no impact to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on business combinations and noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this new standard changes the accounting for acquisition transaction costs by requiring them to be expensed in the period incurred and also changes the accounting for contingent consideration  acquired contingencies  and restructuring costs related to an acquisition 
additionally  it requires that a noncontrolling minority interest in a consolidated subsidiary be displayed in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of equity 
it also indicates that gains and losses should not be recognized on sales of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries but that differences between sale proceeds and the consolidated basis of accounting should be accounted for as charges or credits to consolidated additional paid in capital 
however  in a sale of a subsidiary s shares that results in the deconsolidation of the subsidiary  a gain or loss should be recognized for the difference between the proceeds of that sale and the carrying amount of the interest sold 
also  a new fair value in any remaining noncontrolling ownership interest should be established 
the adoption of this standard on october  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  although it will impact accounting and disclosure of future business acquisitions 
in march  the fasb issued a new standard on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the objective of the new standard is to have entities provide qualitative disclosures about the objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative data about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative contracts  and details of credit risk related contingent features in their hedge positions 
the standard also requires entities to disclose more information about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in financial statements 
this standard is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year after november  this standard amends only the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedged items 
since the company currently has limited derivative related activities  the adoption of this standard on october   had no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to the determination of useful life of intangible assets 
this new standard requires an entity to consider its own historical renewal or extension experience in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
in the absence of entity specific experience  the new standard requires an entity to consider assumptions that a marketplace participant would use about renewal or extension that are consistent with the highest and best use of the asset by a marketplace participant 
the intent of this standard is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
the standard applies prospectively to all intangible assets newly acquired during fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  early adoption is prohibited 
additional disclosures are required for all capitalized intangible assets as of the effective date 
our adoption of this standard on october   did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  although it may impact the determination of the useful life of intangible assets acquired after september  in june  the fasb issued a new standard related to the determination of whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities to be included in the computation of earnings per share 
the new standard clarifies that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and are to be included in the computation of earnings per share under the two class method 
this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
our adoption of this new standard on october   did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued a new standard related to determining the fair value of financial assets when the market for that asset is not active 
the purpose of this standard was to clarify the application of fair value measurements when a market is not active 
it also allows for the use of our internal assumptions about future cash flows with appropriately risk adjusted discount rates when relevant observable market data does not exist 
this standard did not change the objective of fair value measurements  which is to determine the price that would be received in an orderly transaction that is not a forced liquidation or distressed sale at the measurement date 
our adoption of this standard on october  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued a new standard which provides guidance on employers disclosures about the plan assets of defined benefit plans  pensions  or other postretirement plans 
the disclosures required by the standard include a description of how investment allocation decisions are made  major categories of plan assets  valuation techniques used to measure fair value of plan assets  the impact of measurements using significant unobservable inputs  and concentrations of risks within plan assets 
the disclosures required by this standard are effective for fiscal years ending after december   with earlier application permitted 
we elected to early adopt the standard for the period ended september  and have included the applicable disclosures in note to our consolidated financial statements included part ii  item of this form k 
in april  the fasb issued a new accounting standard related to the accounting for assets and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies 
the standard addresses the initial recognition  measurement and subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination  and requires that assets acquired or liabilities assumed be initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date 
when fair value cannot be determined  the standard requires using the guidance provided for under accounting for contingencies  and reasonable estimation of the amount of a loss 
the disclosures required are effective for fiscal years ending after december  our adoption of this standard on october   did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  although it will impact the accounting and disclosure of future acquisitions 
in april  the fasb issued additional fair value guidance for determining whether a market is not active and a transaction is not distressed 
the additional guidance does not include any specific disclosure requirements  but provides additional guidance to highlight and expand on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for financial assets 
this standard is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended march  our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  although it may impact the determination of fair value of applicable instruments in future periods 
in april  the fasb issued a new standard related to the recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
this standard amends the other than temporary guidance for debt securities 
the new standard changes the method for determining whether an other than temporary impairment exists for debt securities and the amount of the impairment charge to be recorded in earnings 
additionally  the standard expands and increases the disclosure requirements about other than temporary impairments to include a the cost basis of available for sale and held to maturity debt securities by major security type  b the methodology and key inputs used to measure the portion of an other than temporary impairment related to credit losses by major security type  and c a schedule of activity of amounts recognized in earnings for debt securities for which an other than temporary impairment has been recognized and the noncredit portion of the other than temporary impairment recognized in other comprehensive income 
we elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended march  our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  although it may impact the amount of other than temporary impairments  if any  recorded in a future period 
in april  the fasb issued a new standard related to interim disclosures about the fair values of financial instruments amending existing accounting standards by requiring public companies to disclose the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments  in both interim and annual financial statements 
this standard was effective for all interim and annual periods ending after june  we elected to early adopt this standard in the quarter ended march  our adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued a new standard establishing the general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of  events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  this standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the standard was effective for the interim or annual financial periods ending after june  further  in connection with preparation of the consolidated financial statements and in accordance with this standard  management completed its evaluation of subsequent events through november  
table of contents in june  the fasb established the accounting standards codification as the single source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards applicable for all non governmental entities  with the exception of the sec and its staff 
the codification  which changes the referencing of financial standards  is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after september  our adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements  although it changed how we refer to accounting standards under us gaap 
in august  the fasb issued a new standard related to fair value measurements and disclosures and measuring liabilities at fair value 
this standard provides further guidance on how to measure the fair value of a liability and provides the following guidance sets forth the types of valuation techniques to be used to value a liability when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  clarifies that when estimating the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability  and clarifies that both a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability at the measurement date and the quoted price for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market when adjustments to the quoted price of the asset are required are level fair value measurements 
our adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued a new standard related to accounting for transfers of financial assets and amending previous guidance in order to enhance reporting about transfers of financial assets  including securitizations  and where companies have continuing exposure to risks related to transferred financial assets 
this standard eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity and changes the requirements for derecognizing financial assets 
it also requires additional disclosures about all continuing involvements with transferred financial assets including information about gains and losses resulting from transfers during the period 
this standard will be effective fiscal years beginning after november   our fiscal we currently do not anticipate that adoption of this standard will result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which changes how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a company is required to consolidate an entity is based on  among other things  an entity s purpose and design and a company s ability to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the new standard also requires additional disclosures about the reporting entity s involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement as well as its affect on the entity s financial statements 
this standard will be effective fiscal years beginning after november   our fiscal we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued a new standard related to the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this standard establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this standard also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this standard significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   and early adoption is permitted 
a company may elect  but will not be required  to adopt the amendments in this standard retrospectively for all prior periods 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this section  we tell you about market risks we think could have a significant impact on our bottom line or the financial strength of our company 
market risks here generally mean how results of operations and the value of assets and liabilities could be affected by market factors such as interest rates  currency exchange rates  the value of commodities  and debt and equity price risks 
if those factors change significantly  it could help or hurt our bottom line  depending on how we react to them 
we are exposed to various market risks 
we have established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing our management of market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
our primary exposures are to collection risk customer receivables and our forethought note  fluctuations in market prices for certain purchases of commodities  variability in exchange rates in foreign locations  and volatility in the fair value of our investments 
we also have some interest rate exposure 
what follows are the specifics 
we have an outstanding note receivable the note and related interest receivable from forethought financial group  inc forethought with an aggregate carrying value of million as of september  the primary risk with the note is collection 
should forethought underperform to an extent that it cannot meet its financial obligations  our earnings could be negatively impacted  resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we currently do not expect this to be the case 
we estimate the fair value of the note receivable from forethought based upon comparison to debt securities currently trading in an active market with similar characteristics of yield  duration  and credit risk adjusted for liquidity considerations 
based upon market data available to us  we estimate that the fair value of the note and accrued interest is approximately million based upon an estimated yield to maturity of approximately as of september  this is approximately million below its carrying value at september  an increase or decrease of in the discount rate utilized to estimate the fair value of the note including interest receivable would indicate a change in fair value of approximately million 
we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain purchased commodity raw materials including steel  wood  red metals  and fuel 
while these materials are typically available from multiple suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to market price fluctuations 
we generally buy these commodities based upon market prices that are established with the supplier as part of the purchasing process 
we generally attempt to obtain firm pricing from our larger suppliers for volumes consistent with planned production 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and we do not have firm pricing from our suppliers  or if our suppliers are not able to honor such prices  we may experience a decline in our gross margins to the extent we are not able to increase selling prices of our products or obtain manufacturing efficiencies to offset increases in commodity costs 
we are subject to variability in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in our canadian operations 
the primary risk here is the significance of the volatility in the exchange rates 
exposure to this variability is partially offset through the use of natural hedges  whereby funding obligations and assets are both managed in the local currency 
from time to time we enter into currency exchange agreements to manage our exposure arising from fluctuating exchange rates related to specific transactions  primarily forecasted intercompany purchasing 
we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies and do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
we have a portfolio of auction rate securities ars with an estimated fair value of million as of september  
we also have an enforceable  non transferable right the put estimated fair value of million as of september  from ubs financial services ubs that allows us to sell approximately million of our existing ars carrying value at september  at par value plus accrued interest 
we may exercise the put at anytime during the period of june   through july  the market for the ars continues to experience auction failures  as the supply of the securities in the market exceeds demand 
as a result  the primary risk here is the lack of a liquid market to sell these investments 
if current market conditions do not improve  we may not be able to readily convert the ars to cash  exposing us to a longer term risk of impairment  and our earnings could be adversely affected 
the put does mitigate this risk on that portion of the ars  to which it applies  assuming that ubs honors the terms of the put 
we currently expect to exercise the put to liquidate the applicable portion of the ars 

table of contents we are also subject to volatility in our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio includes private equity limited partnerships lps and common stock with an aggregate carrying value of million at september  these investments could be adversely affected by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates  default on debt instruments and other factors  resulting in an adverse impact 
the changes in the fair value of the lps underlying investment portfolios can impact us significantly because we record our share of the change in our income statement under the equity method of accounting 
our pension plans assets are also subject to volatility that can be caused by fluctuation in general economic conditions
