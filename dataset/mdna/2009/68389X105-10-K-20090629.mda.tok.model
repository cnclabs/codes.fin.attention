item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with an overview of our key operating business segments and significant trends 
this overview is followed by a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
we then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents business overview we are the world s largest enterprise software company 
we develop  manufacture  market  distribute and service database and middleware software as well as applications software designed to help our customers manage and grow their business operations 
we believe our internal  or organic  growth and continued innovation with respect to our software products and services offerings provide the foundation for our long term strategic plan 
we invest billions of dollars in research and development each year to enhance our existing portfolio of products and services and to develop new products  features and services 
our internally developed offerings have been enhanced by our acquisitions 
we are organized into two businesses  software and services  which are further divided into five operating segments 
each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
although we report our actual results in us dollars  we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than us dollars 
therefore  we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
an overview of our five operating segments follows 
software business our software business  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  is comprised of two operating segments new software license revenues and software license updates and product support revenues 
on a constant currency basis  we expect that our software business revenues generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our products  including the high percentage of customers that renew their software license updates and product support contracts  and due to our acquisitions  which should allow us to grow our profits and continue to make investments in research and development 
new software licenses we license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes  government agencies  educational institutions and resellers 
the growth in new software license revenues that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  governmental budgetary constraints  the competitive position of our software products  our acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations 
our new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues 
since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions  we believe that analysis of new software license revenues on a trailing quarter period as provided in our quarterly reports on form q provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business 
new software license revenues represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
our new software license margins have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs are predominantly fixed in the short term 
however  our new software license margins have been and will continue to be affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies that we have acquired 
competition in the software business is intense 
our goal is to maintain a first or second position in each of our software product categories and certain industry segments as well as to grow our software revenues faster than our competitors 
we believe that the features and functionality of our software products are as strong as they have ever been 
we have focused on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products by improving integration  decreasing installation times  lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use 
in addition  our broad portfolio of product offerings many of which have been acquired in recent years helps us to offer customers the ability to gain efficiencies by consolidating their it software stack with a single vendor  which reduces the number of disparate software vendors with which customers interact 
reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides our customers with a higher return on their it investments  which we believe creates more demand for our products and services and provides us with a competitive advantage 
we have also continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our software products and service levels 
we believe this will lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve our goal of becoming our customers leading technology advisor 

table of contents software license updates and product support customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period  as well as technical support assistance 
in addition  we offer oracle unbreakable linux support  which provides enterprise level support for the linux operating system  and also offer support for our oracle vm server virtualization software 
substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
the growth of software license updates and product support revenues is primarily influenced by three factors the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews its support contracts  the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses  and the amount of support contracts assumed from companies we have acquired 
software license updates and product support revenues  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  is our highest margin business unit 
support margins during fiscal were  and accounted for of our total margins over the same period 
our software license update and product support margins have been affected by fair value adjustments relating to support obligations assumed in business combinations described further below and by amortization of intangible assets 
however  over the longer term  we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will grow for the following reasons substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal  substantially all of our customers purchase license updates and product support contracts when they buy new software licenses  resulting in a further increase in our support contract base 
even if new software license revenue growth was flat  software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year periods assuming renewal and cancellation rates and foreign currency rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions add to our support contract base  and our acquisitions have increased our support contract base  as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed and supported 
we record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business acquisitions to their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates 
as a result  as required by business combination accounting rules  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
to the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the majority of which are one year 
services business our services business consists of consulting  on demand and education 
our services business  which represented  and of our total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  has significantly lower margins than our software business 
consulting our consulting line of business provides services to customers in business it strategy alignment  business process simplification  solution integration  and product implementation  enhancements  and upgrades of our database  middleware and applications software 
the amount of consulting revenues recognized tends to lag software revenue recognition by several quarters since consulting services  if purchased  are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses 
our consulting revenues are dependent upon general economic conditions and the level of new software license sales  particularly our application product sales 
to the extent we are able to grow our new software license revenues  in particular our application product revenues  we would also generally expect to be able to grow our consulting revenues 
on demand on demand includes oracle on demand and our advanced customer services offerings 
we believe that our on demand offerings provide our customers flexibility in how they manage their it environments and an additional opportunity to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive 
table of contents advantage 
recently  we have grown the base of customers that have purchased our on demand services and to the extent we are able to continue this trend  we would expect our on demand revenues and margins to increase 
we have made and plan to continue to make investments in our on demand business to support current and future revenue growth  which historically has negatively impacted on demand margins and may do so in the future 
education the purpose of our education services is to further the adoption and usage of our software products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our software revenues 
education revenues are impacted by general economic conditions  personnel reductions in our customers information technology departments  tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions 
we believe the recent global economic environment has unfavorably affected customer demand for our education services in comparison to prior years  which has negatively impacted our revenues and margins 
acquisitions an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy 
in recent years  we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies  products  services and technologies 
on april   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger merger agreement with sun microsystems  inc sun  a provider of enterprise computing systems  software and services 
pursuant to the merger agreement  our wholly owned subsidiary will merge with and into sun and sun will become a wholly owned subsidiary of oracle 
upon the consummation of the merger  each share of sun common stock will be converted into the right to receive in cash 
in addition  options to acquire sun common stock  sun restricted stock unit awards and other equity based awards denominated in shares of sun common stock outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger will generally be converted into options  restricted stock unit awards or other equity based awards  as the case may be  denominated in shares of oracle common stock based on formulas contained in the merger agreement 
the estimated total purchase price of sun is approximately billion 
this transaction is subject to sun stockholder approval  regulatory clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and the applicable merger control laws of the european commission and other jurisdictions  and other customary closing conditions 
we believe our acquisition program supports our long term strategic direction  strengthens our competitive position  expands our customer base  provides greater scale to accelerate innovation  grows our revenues and earnings  and increases stockholder value 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our recent acquisitions 
we believe we can fund our pending and future acquisitions with our internally available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  amounts available under our existing debt capacity  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings  operating margin  cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition business combinations 
table of contents goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments accounting for income taxes legal and other contingencies stock based compensation allowances for doubtful accounts in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed the below critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the finance and audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the following sources software  which includes new software license and software license updates and product support revenues  and services  which include consulting  on demand and education revenues 
new software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database  middleware and applications software  and exclude revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and product support 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  we recognize new software license revenue when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner 
the vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support  which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
product support includes internet access to technical content  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers 
software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees 
substantially all of our customers purchase both software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses 
in addition  substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the 
table of contents customer 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenues and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions  then new software license revenues are generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method 
contract accounting is applied to any arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees  where services include significant modification or customization of the software  where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted  or where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services 
on demand is comprised of oracle on demand and advanced customer services 
oracle on demand provides multi featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database  middleware and applications software delivered at our data center facilities  select partner data centers or customer facilities 
advanced customer services provide customers with solution lifecycle management services  database and application management services  industry specific solution support centers and remote and on site expert services 
revenues from on demand services are recognized over the term of the service period  which is generally one year 
education revenues include instructor led  media based and internet based training in the use of our products 
education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately  and for software license updates and product support services is also measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
for software license arrangements that include hardware  software and services  and the software is more than incidental to the multiple element arrangement  but not essential to the functionality of the hardware  we apply the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  which allows the non software elements and related services to be accounted for pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition topic  and eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and the software license and related services to be accounted for pursuant to sop we defer revenues for any undelivered elements  and recognize revenues when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for each such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenues until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
however  if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy  for example in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law  or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature  we generally recognize revenues upon delivery provided the acceptance 
table of contents terms are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if acceptance provisions are not perfunctory for example  acceptance provisions that are long term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  the essential use of the software licenses and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote  we then recognize revenues once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenues if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net days 
however  payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
while most of our arrangements include short term payment terms  we have a standard practice of providing long term financing to credit worthy customers through our financing division 
since fiscal  when our financing division was formed  we have established a history of collection  without concessions  on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize new software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery  net of any payment discounts from financing transactions 
we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions 
we account for the sale of these receivables as true sales as defined in fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have licensed our software to these same companies concurrent transaction 
software license agreements that occur within a three month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure 
when we acquire goods or services from a customer  we negotiate the purchase separately from any software license transaction  at terms we consider to be at arm s length  and settle the purchase in cash 
we recognize new software license revenues from concurrent transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations 
business combinations fiscal and prior periods in accordance with fasb statement no 
 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  
table of contents expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
the sum of these costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with any selling efforts is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded those selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
we also do not include the estimated research and development costs in our fair value determinations  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
as a result  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amounts of million  million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal  and  respectively 
historically  substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal 
to the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the substantial majority of which are one year 
had we included costs for our estimated selling and research and development activities and the associated margin for unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided under our assumed support arrangements  the fair values of the support obligations would have been significantly higher than what we had recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount of software license updates and product support revenues both historically and in future periods related to these assumed support arrangements 
other significant estimates associated with the accounting for business combinations include restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are typically comprised of severance costs  costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs 
restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management  but are generally subject to refinement during the purchase price allocation period generally within one year of the acquisition date 
to estimate restructuring expenses  management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan 
decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with pre merger activities of the companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely  whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period and as operating expenses thereafter 
for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies 
if  during the purchase price allocation period  we are able to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation 
if  as of the end of the purchase price allocation period  we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated 
through fiscal  after the end of the purchase price allocation period  any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre acquisition contingency  with the exception of unresolved income tax matters  were included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment was determined 

table of contents fiscal in fiscal  we will adopt fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations 
for any business combination that is consummated pursuant to statement r  including our proposed acquisition of sun described above  we will recognize separately from goodwill  the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally at their acquisition date fair values as defined by fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred  which is also generally measured at fair value  and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
the determination of fair value will require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  with respect to intangible assets acquired  support obligations assumed  and pre acquisition contingencies 
the assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair values of these items will be substantially similar upon our adoption of statement r as they were under statement see above 
the below discussion lists those areas of statement r that we believe  upon our adoption  require us to apply additional  significant estimates and assumptions 
upon our adoption of statement r  any changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions will be recorded in current period income tax expense  unless any such changes are identified during the measurement period defined as the period  not to exceed one year  in which we may adjust the provisional amounts recognized for a business combination and relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date 
our estimates for the ultimate outcome of income tax matters are based on the best information available to us as of the acquisition date and corresponding measurement period 
additional information may become available subsequent to the acquisition date and corresponding measurement period  which may require us to revise our estimates for these income tax matters 
such estimate revisions that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments will be recorded to our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations in the period the revision is made and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
upon our adoption of statement r  we will account for one time termination and exit costs associated with prospective acquisitions pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
in order to incur a liability pursuant to statement  our management must have established and approved a plan of restructuring in sufficient detail 
a liability for a cost associated with involuntary termination benefits is recorded when benefits have been communicated and a liability for a cost to terminate an operating lease or other contract are incurred when the contract has been terminated in accordance with the contract terms or we have ceased using the right conveyed by the contract  such as vacating a leased facility 
statement requires the use of assumptions and estimates  including estimated sub lease payments to be received  which can differ materially from actual results 
this may require us to revise our estimated liabilities and may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the revision is made 
in addition  the recognition of liabilities pursuant to statement are subject to certain criteria being met  such as the communication of benefits to be paid to employees and the cessation of benefits received under existing contracts  amongst others 
these criteria can cause variability in the timing of recognition of restructuring liabilities  which could cause us to incur expenses in periods we had not expected and could materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
if the initial accounting for a business combination that is accounted for pursuant to statement r is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the business combination occurs  we will report the provisional amounts for such items in our consolidated financial statements 
during the measurement period  we will adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and record those adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
those measurement period adjustments that we determine to be significant will be applied retrospectively to comparative information in our consolidated financial statements  including adjustments to depreciation  amortization  or other income effects recognized in the initial accounting 
identifying changes to the initial accounting requires our 
table of contents management to apply judgment in determining whether the subsequent information received relates to facts and circumstances that existed for the provisional items as of the acquisition date  including information that affects the estimated amounts involved 
to the extent significant measurement period adjustments are identified  the comparative financial information we present for a reporting period could be materially revised in comparison to that which we had previously presented in our earnings releases and related filings with the us securities and exchange commission sec 
our adoption of statement r in fiscal will also change how we account for certain other areas of business combinations in comparison to how these areas are currently accounted for pursuant to statement and related accounting guidance  including the expensing of direct transaction costs 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of statement require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge  nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal or we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment may exist 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal  or accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and 
table of contents segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
remittances of foreign earnings to the us are planned based on projected cash flow  working capital and investment needs of our foreign and domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the us and provide us federal taxes on these amounts 
material changes in our estimates or tax legislation that limits or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the united states could impact our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known  which can materially impact our effective tax rate 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we account for our uncertain tax issues pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
as a part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation process 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions  including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates  in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
as described in the business combinations section above  through fiscal  income tax contingencies that exist as of the acquisition date for an acquired company are evaluated quarterly and any changes are recorded as adjustments to goodwill 
for fiscal  we will make our best estimate of income tax contingencies that we 
table of contents assumed from our legacy acquisitions  and that we will assume from any future acquisitions  as of the acquisition date and during the related measurement period and we will reassess our estimates quarterly 
subsequent to the measurement period  adjustments to these income tax contingencies will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we account for share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock awards and purchases under employee stock purchase plans in accordance with fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that share based payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
in addition  we have applied certain of the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
topic  as amended  in our accounting for statement r 
we are required to estimate the stock awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures upon historical experience  actual forfeitures in the future may differ 
in addition  to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could materially affect our operating results 
as required by statement r  we recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payments issued or assumed after june  that are expected to vest 
for all share based payments granted or assumed beginning june   we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period of the award  which is generally four years 
the fair value of the unvested portion of share based payments granted prior to june  is recognized over the remaining service period using the accelerated expense attribution method  net of estimated forfeitures 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated  forward looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates 
stock based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly 
we also consider  each quarter  whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we use the implied volatility of our publicly traded  longest term options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we have used historical rates of employee groups by seniority of job classification 
our expected dividend rate was zero prior to our first dividend declaration in the fourth quarter of fiscal as we did not historically pay cash dividends on our common stock and did not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future for grants issued prior to this declaration date 
for grants issued subsequent to this dividend 
table of contents declaration date  we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our board of directors 
the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense we record to vary 
we record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction 
because the deferred tax assets we record are based upon the stock based compensation expenses in a particular jurisdiction  the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair value of our stock awards may also indirectly affect our income tax expense 
in addition  differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method as prescribed under fasb staff position fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs  experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increases the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded  longest term options or refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our current estimates  amongst other potential impacts  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods and the tax benefits that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting periods 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable  the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowances for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and our future results of operations could be materially affected 
results of operations impact of acquisitions the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is impacted by our acquisitions  primarily the acquisition of bea systems  inc in our fourth quarter of fiscal the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily impacted by our acquisition of hyperion solutions corporation in our fourth quarter of fiscal and our acquisition of bea in our fourth quarter of fiscal in our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal  we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to the growth in new software license revenues and to the growth in software license updates and product support revenues for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date 
we also present supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains 
although certain revenue and expense contributions from our acquisitions are quantifiable  we are unable to identify the following the contribution of the significant majority of our services revenues from acquired companies in fiscal  and as the significant majority of these services had been fully integrated into our existing operations  and 
table of contents the contribution of the significant majority of the expenses associated with acquired products and services in fiscal  and as the significant majority of these expenses had been fully integrated into our existing operations 
we caution readers that the contribution from bea products  which already have been integrated with oracle s fusion middleware and are sold together  to our total database and middleware revenues during fiscal are based on our internal allocations that have been applied consistently 
we further caution readers that  while pre and post acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends  the information has inherent limitations for the following reasons the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to our sales force integration efforts  in particular the effect of having a single sales force offer similar products 
we believe that if our sales forces had not been integrated  the relative mix of products sold would have been different  our acquisitions in the periods presented did not result in our entry into a new line of business or product category therefore  we provided multiple products with substantially similar features and functionality  and although substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal  amounts shown as support deferred revenues in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charges and gains see below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew 
constant currency presentation our international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses 
as a result  total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the us dollar against major international currencies 
in order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure 
to present this information  current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than us dollars are converted into us dollars at constant exchange rates us the rates in effect on may   which was the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods 
for example  if an entity reporting in euros had revenues of million euros from products sold on may  and may   our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of million in fiscal using as the month end average exchange rate for the period and million in fiscal using as the month end average exchange rate for the period 
the constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal results using the fiscal exchange rate and indicate  in this example  no change in revenues during the period 
in each of the tables below  we present the percent change based on actual  unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency

these currency variances resulted in a reduction to our total revenues growth of percentage points during fiscal on a constant currency basis  total revenues increased in fiscal primarily due to higher software license update and product support revenues in all regions due to the high attachment rate of support contracts to our new software license sales and the renewal of substantially all of our eligible customer support contracts  incremental revenues from our recent acquisitions  primarily our acquisition of bea in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increased demand for our on demand service offerings

excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed to the increase in total revenues  emea contributed and asia pacific contributed 
currency variances resulted in a reduction to our total operating expense growth of percentage points during fiscal excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in operating expenses in fiscal is primarily due to higher salary expenses associated with increased headcount levels from acquisitions primarily bea and higher amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions primarily bea that we completed since the beginning of fiscal in addition  acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal due to a million gain on property sale recognized in fiscal  which decreased operating expenses in that period

table of contents of total revenues increased during fiscal as the growth rate of our total revenues exceeded the growth rate of our total operating expenses

fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues increased in fiscal due to increased demand for our products and services offerings and incremental revenues from our acquisitions 
the growth in our total revenues was positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points in fiscal due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to other major international currencies

total operating expenses were adversely affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels primarily resulting from our fiscal acquisitions  our acquisition of agile software corporation in the first quarter of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  our acquisition of bea in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as higher commissions and bonuses associated with increased revenues  earnings and headcount levels 
in addition  operating expenses also increased in fiscal due to higher amortization of intangible assets and additional stock based compensation resulting from a higher fair value of grants caused primarily by our higher stock price issued in fiscal and the acceleration of vesting of certain acquired stock awards upon employee terminations pursuant to the original terms of those awards 
total operating expenses in fiscal were also reduced by a million benefit as a result of a settlement of an acquired legal contingency from peoplesoft for less than the amount accrued as of the end of the purchase price allocation period 
the increases in operating expenses during fiscal were partially offset by a million gain on property sale and a million reduction of in process research and development 
total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased during fiscal the growth in our operating margin in fiscal was the result of our revenue growth  both organic and from acquisitions  which generally exceeded the growth rate of the majority of our expenses

the changes in obligations and asset values of the plan are equal and offsetting  such that there is no impact to our income before provision for income taxes during fiscal or any other periods presented 
fiscal compared to fiscal non operating income  net increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher weighted average cash and marketable securities balances during fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the us federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations

our working capital may be impacted by all of the aforementioned factors in future periods  certain amounts and timing of which are variable 
the increase in working capital as of may  in comparison to may  was primarily due to an increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances resulting from the issuance of billion of long term senior notes in april  additional cash and trade receivables generated from our operations and our adoption of fin  which resulted in billion of uncertain tax positions being prospectively reclassified from current income taxes payable to non current taxes payable 
these increases in working capital were partially offset by cash used in fiscal to pay for our acquisitions primarily bea and to repurchase our common stock 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks  money market funds  tier commercial paper  us treasury obligations  us government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations  and other securities with original maturities of days or less 
marketable securities primarily consist of time deposits held at major banks  tier commercial paper  corporate notes  us treasury obligations and us government agency and government sponsored enterprise obligations 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at may  in comparison to may  was due to an increase in cash generated from our operating activities 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities include billion held by our foreign subsidiaries as of may  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in us dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
as the us dollar strengthened against most major international currencies during fiscal  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in us dollars for these subsidiaries declined relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of may  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were also partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions  the repayment of billion of senior notes in may  the repurchases of our common stock see discussion above  and the payment of cash dividends to our stockholders 

table of contents the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at may  in comparison to may  is due to the issuance of billion of senior notes in april and an increase in our operating cash flows resulting primarily from an increase in net income  partially offset by cash used for our acquisitions primarily bea  net repayments of our short term commercial paper notes  and repurchases of our common stock 
days sales outstanding  which is calculated by dividing period end accounts receivable by average daily sales for the quarter  was days at may  compared with days at may  the days sales outstanding calculation excludes the adjustment that reduces our acquired software license updates and product support obligations to fair value 
our decline in days sales outstanding is primarily due to the improved timeliness of our collections efforts and the mix of our total revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal  which weighted more heavily toward our license updates and product support revenues such revenues generally have a lower dso than our revenues from our other operating segments 
year ended may  dollars in millions change change cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities cash used for provided by financing activities cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their software license updates and product support agreements 
payments from customers for software license updates and product support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts terms  which are generally one year in length 
we also generate significant cash from new software license sales and  to a lesser extent  services 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures as well as payments related to taxes and leased facilities 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal primarily due to higher net income adjusting for amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation and other net cash favorable balance sheet movements 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal primarily due to higher net income  partially offset by increased accounts receivable primarily due to fourth quarter fiscal revenues growth in particular  our new software license revenues growth 
cash flows from investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases  maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities 
we also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth

free cash flow to supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis  we use non gaap measures of cash flows on a trailing quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations 
we believe free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our competitors 
the presentation of non gaap free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
we calculate free cash flows as follows year ended may  dollars in millions change change cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow net income free cash flow as a percent of net income represents capital expenditures as reported in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
long term customer financing we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and service offerings through separate long term payment contracts 
we generally sell contracts that we have financed on a non recourse basis to financial institutions 
we record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financial assets because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financial assets 
in fiscal  and  billion  billion and million or approximately  and  respectively  of our new software license revenues were financed through our financing division 
recent financing activities in recent years  we have issued long term senior notes to fund our acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
during fiscal  we repaid billion of senior notes that matured in may as of may   we have billion of senior notes outstanding  including billion that matures in may we have also  on occasion  issued short term commercial paper notes in recent years pursuant to our commercial paper program to assist with the short term financing for certain of our acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes 
typically  we have repaid these liabilities within months or less from their issuance date 
we also have entered into certain revolving credit agreements to back stop any commercial paper notes we may issue and for other general corporate purposes 
as of may   we have no commercial paper notes or amounts under our credit agreements outstanding 
if we issue commercial paper notes in the future  we would most likely use our revolving credit agreements as a back stop to these notes and we therefore consider that we have a total of billion of capacity available to us pursuant to our credit agreements and commercial paper program as of may  additional details of our various debt facilities and obligations are included in the contractual obligations section below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and risks associated with our debt obligations and any future debt issuances are included in risk factors item a

we repurchased million shares for billion  million shares for billion  and million shares for billion in fiscal  and  respectively 
our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs  our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend repayments  our debt repayment obligations as described below  our stock price  and economic and market conditions 
our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule b plan 
our stock repurchase program may be accelerated  suspended  delayed or discontinued at any time

contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of may  year ending may  dollars in millions total thereafter principal payments on borrowings capital leases interest payments on borrowings operating leases purchase obligations funding commitments total contractual obligations our borrowings excluding capital leases consist of the following as of may  principal balance floating rate senior notes due may senior notes due january  net of discount of senior notes due april senior notes due january  net of discount of senior notes due april  net of discount of senior notes due april  net of discount of total borrowings our floating rate senior notes due may bore interest at a rate of as of may  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement that has the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floating rate senior notes due may so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively became fixed at a rate of 
interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreement and include estimates based on the effective interest rates as of may  for variable rate borrowings after consideration of the aforementioned interest rate swap agreement

amounts in this row do not include purchase orders for raw materials and other goods entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way 
represents the maximum additional capital we may need to contribute toward our venture fund investments  which are payable upon demand 
on april   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger merger agreement with sun microsystems  inc  a provider of enterprise computing systems  software and services 
pursuant to the merger agreement  our wholly owned subsidiary will merge with and into sun and sun will become a wholly owned subsidiary of oracle 
upon the consummation of the merger  each share of sun common stock will be converted into the right to receive in cash 
in addition  options to acquire sun common stock  sun restricted stock unit awards and other equity 
table of contents based awards denominated in shares of sun common stock outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger will generally be converted into options  restricted stock unit awards or other equity based awards  as the case may be  denominated in shares of our common stock based on formulas contained in the merger agreement 
the estimated total purchase price of sun is approximately billion 
this transaction is subject to sun stockholder approval  regulatory clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and the applicable merger control laws of the european commission and other jurisdictions  and other customary closing conditions 
we also have entered into certain other agreements to acquire other companies and expect these proposed acquisitions to close during the first quarter of fiscal we intend to finance our proposed acquisitions through a combination of our internally available cash  our cash generated from operations  our existing available debt capacity  additional borrowings  or from the issuance of additional securities 
as of may   we have billion of unrecognized tax benefits recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have reached certain settlement agreements with relevant taxing authorities to pay approximately million of these liabilities these amounts have been excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of when they might be settled 
although it remains unclear as to when payments pursuant to these agreements will be made  some or all may be made in fiscal we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which the remainder of our unrecognized tax benefits will be settled or released with the relevant tax authorities  although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and contractual obligations 
in addition  we believe we could fund any future acquisitions  including the proposed sun acquisition  and dividend payments and repurchase common stock or debt with our internally available cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  our existing available debt capacity  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
selected quarterly financial data quarterly revenues  expenses and operating income have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors  including sales force incentive compensation plans 
in addition  our european operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in europe during the summer 
these seasonal factors are common in the software industry 
these factors have caused a decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter  which historically has been our highest revenue quarter within a particular fiscal year 
similarly  the operating income of our business is affected by seasonal factors in a consistent manner as our revenues in particular  our new software license business as certain expenses within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term 
we expect these trends to continue in fiscal 
table of contents the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
we believe that all necessary adjustments  which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding

we recognize that options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
consistent with these dual goals  our cumulative potential dilution since june  has been a weighted average annualized rate of per year 
the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new options granted and assumed  net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company  divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised 
some of these options  which generally have year exercise periods  have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price of our common stock 
at may   of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 
consistent with our historical practices  we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed per year for our ongoing business 
in recent years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option program  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions  to pay dividends  to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes 
at may   the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised option awards  regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price  was

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest income risk our bank deposits and money market investments are generally held with a number of large  diverse financial institutions worldwide that we believe mitigates some of the exposures associated with our holdings with these financial institutions 
in addition  we purchase high quality debt security investments  substantially all with relatively short maturities see a description of our debt securities held in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources above 
therefore  interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our debt security investments 
substantially all of our marketable securities are designated as available for sale 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities

we have entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations associated with our floating rate senior notes so that the interest payable on the senior notes effectively became fixed at a rate of  thereby reducing the impact of future interest rate changes on our future interest expense 
we do not use interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes 
the critical terms of the interest rate swap agreement and the senior notes match  including the notional amounts  interest rate reset dates  maturity dates and underlying market indices 
accordingly  we have designated the swap as a qualifying instrument and are accounting for the swap as a cash flow hedge pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the unrealized losses on the swap are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and the corresponding fair value payable is included in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
the periodic interest settlements  which occur at the same interval as the interest payment and reset dates as the senior notes  are recorded as interest expense 
foreign currency risk foreign currency transaction risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts that we enter into to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses resulting from fair value changes included in non operating income  net the effective portion of our yen net investment hedge described below is included in stockholders equity 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
the notional amounts of foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell us dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were million and billion  respectively  and to purchase euros in exchange for other major international currencies was million million  as of may  the net unrealized gains of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were million at may  net foreign exchange transaction losses gains included in non operating income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon translation of these amounts into us dollars

table of contents subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period the offset to which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
we hedge net assets of certain international subsidiaries from foreign currency exposure and provide a discussion in foreign currency net investment risk below 
as the us dollar strengthened against most major international currencies during fiscal  the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that we reported in us dollars for these subsidiaries as of may  declined relative to what we would have reported using a constant currency rate as of may  as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows  the effect of exchange rate changes on our reported cash and cash equivalents balances in us dollars for fiscal  and was a decrease increase of million  million  and million  respectively

foreign currency net investment risk we hedge the net assets of certain of our international subsidiaries net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to offset the translation and economic exposures related to our investments in these subsidiaries 
we measure the effectiveness of our net investment hedges by using the changes in spot exchange rates because this method reflects our risk management strategies  the economics of those strategies in our financial statements and better manages interest rate differentials between different countries 
under this method  the change in fair value of the forward contract attributable to the changes in spot exchange rates the effective portion is reported in stockholders equity to offset the translation results on the net investments
