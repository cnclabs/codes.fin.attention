we also sell products through the safety and industrial distributor channel principally under the lacrosse brand for consumers who regard our specialized footwear as critical tools for the job 
additionally  we position the danner brand as performance footwear built to meet the unique demands and specific requirements for multiple branches of the us armed forces

the percentage of net sales into work markets in  and were approximately  and  respectively and sales to outdoor markets were approximately  and  respectively 
product design and development our product design and development concepts originate from our staff and through communication with our customers and suppliers 
we stay in constant contact with our customers to understand consumer demand and trends 
product concepts are based upon perceived consumer needs and may include new technological developments in footwear  apparel and materials 
consumers  sales representatives and suppliers all provide information to our marketing and product development personnel during the concept  development and testing of new products 
our marketing and product development personnel  at times in conjunction with outside design consultants  determine the final aesthetics of the product 
once a product design is approved for production  responsibility may be shared with outside sourcing facilities or with our domestic manufacturing facility for pattern development and commercialization 
our presence in portland  oregon provides access to a broad talent pool of footwear and apparel design professionals 
customers  sales  and distribution we market our two brands through five channels of distribution retail  safety and industrial  government  direct  and international 
within the retail channel  the lacrosse and danner brands are marketed through independent representative agencies and our in house sales staff 
for both brands  some of the independent agents are part of multi line representative groups and some are dedicated solely to our products 
a national account sales team complements the sales activities for the brands 
our retail distribution base consists of over  accounts  including sporting goods and outdoor retailers  general merchandise and independent shoe stores  wholesalers  distributors  and federal  state  and local government agencies 
our customer base is also diversified as to size and location of customer and markets served 
as a result  we are less dependent upon a few customers 
however  our retail customers have recently shown a trend towards consolidation into regional  super regional  and national businesses  and this trend has the effect of consolidating our customer base 
as consolidation continues  our dependency on fewer  larger customers may increase 
our safety and industrial channel focuses on end users who view their footwear and apparel as critical tools for the job 
these end users depend on lacrosse products to provide functionality  comfort and protection from workplace hazards 
the industries we focus on include mining  oil and gas  transportation and utilities 
while the majority of our products in this channel are sold through distributor partners  such products are also sold through the retail channels 

table of contents the government channel provides performance footwear built to meet the demands and specific requirements for multiple branches of the armed forces 
for example  the danner marine hot boot is specifically built with performance materials to mitigate heat 
in addition  we produce the mountain cold weather boot for the us marines which is built with extreme abrasion resistance  unique construction and a supportive vibram outsole  to enhance performance in extreme mountain conditions and climates 
these products are manufactured in the company s iso certified manufacturing facility located in portland  oregon 
in addition to receiving direct orders for these products from the respective branches of the military  danner military products are also available through retail and exchange stores on us marine corps  army  and air force bases  and on danner s web site www 
danner 
com 
relating to our direct channels of distribution  we currently operate four internet websites for use by consumers and retailers 
the primary purpose of the consumer oriented websites is to provide product and company information 
in addition  two of these sites sell products to consumers who choose to purchase directly from us 
the business to business website for the lacrosse and danner brands provides product ordering capability and critical information to dealers about the status of pending orders  inventory levels  shipping and other data 
our corporate website  www 
lacrossefootwearinc 
com  provides information about the company and its brands to investors and the corporate community 
we operate a retail outlet store at the factory in portland  oregon 
the factory outlet store sells slow moving merchandise  factory seconds  and first quality products for both danner and lacrosse brands 
international sales are primarily derived through our japanese and canadian independent distribution and dealer networks as well as our subsidiary lacrosse europe aps  which was established in to acquire certain assets of our former european distributor and to strengthen our direct sales and marketing support to customers in europe 
advertising and promotion we create customized advertising and marketing materials and programs for each brand and distribution channel  which allows us to emphasize relevant product features that have special appeal to the applicable targeted consumer 
we advertise and promote our products through a variety of methods including national and regional print advertising  public relations  point of sale displays  catalogs and packaging  product licensing agreements and sponsorships  online promotion and co promotion with dealers and suppliers 
our largest initiatives include marketing development funds  which include advertising and local retail partner events  are funds provided by the company to help retail customers market and sell danner and lacrosse products  marketing material updates  website upgrades  point of purchase and related advertising  and visual merchandising  which focuses on all branded point of sale development and production 
we believe that once a consumer understands the features and benefits of our products  they will be more likely to become a loyal customer 
as such  we are committed to ensuring that the benefits  features and advanced technologies of all our products are clearly articulated at our customers retail stores 
we have established retail store education programs in which we send representatives to train the sales associates of all key retailers 
we coordinate with retail store managers to improve product positioning and point of sale information displays 

table of contents manufacturing and sourcing manufacturing overview we source approximately three fourths of the products we sell through a network of international contract manufacturers  primarily in china  with the remaining one fourth manufactured domestically in our  square foot facility in portland  oregon 
our domestic manufacturing facility provides a number of benefits  including increased brand authenticity and compliance with government manufacturing requirements  such as the berry amendment legislation promoting domestic or home grown products for government entities 
we routinely take current and potential customers on tours through our factory  showcasing the quality of our brands 
this has historically translated into stronger demand and shelf space for our footwear products 
sourcing overview in  we formed lacrosse international  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary with an office in zhongshan  china 
lacrosse international has three primary functions work with suppliers to maintain our standards for high quality products and labor practices  locate and develop relationships with complementary sourcing alternatives  and increase speed to market for new products 
we do not have any long term contracts with our manufacturers  choosing instead to retain the flexibility to re evaluate our sourcing and manufacturing decisions 
in addition  substantially all of our transactions with our foreign contract manufacturers are in us dollars 
however  these us dollar prices are affected by such things as foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we regularly evaluate our vendors primarily on the quality of their work  cost and ability to deliver on time 
approximately two thirds of our outsourced products are purchased from two foreign manufacturers located in china 
alternate sources of capacity for these products are available worldwide 
the raw materials used in production of our products are primarily leather  crude rubber and oil based vinyl compounds for protective clothing products 
we have historically been able to recover any significant increases in our raw material costs through price increases 
both our contract manufacturers and our domestic manufacturing facility purchase gore tex waterproof fabric directly from wl gore and associates gore  for both the lacrosse and danner footwear 
gore tex is a registered trademark of gore 
gore has traditionally been one of danner s largest suppliers in terms of dollars spent on raw materials 
over of danner styles are gore tex lined 
we have contracts with gore that are terminable by either party upon days written notice 
we believe our relationship with gore is good 
in the event the relationship was to terminate  we have identified other sources of products with similar characteristics 
competition the categories of the footwear and apparel markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete with numerous other manufacturers and distributors  many of whom have substantially greater financial  distribution and marketing resources than we do 
because we have a broad product line  our competition varies by product category 
we believe that we maintain a competitive position through the strength of our brands  our attention to quality  delivery of value  position as an innovator  our record of delivering products on a timely basis  strong customer relationships  and  in some cases  the breadth of our product line 
we have five to seven major competitors in each of our market segments which include hunting  work  hiking  and uniform product categories 

table of contents certain of our competitors in leather footwear categories have strong brand name recognition in the markets they serve and are the major competitors of our danner and lacrosse leather product lines 
these competitors manufacture domestically and or import products from offshore 
domestically manufactured danner brand products are generally at a price disadvantage against lower cost imported products 
danner focuses on the premium quality  premium price segment of the market in which product function  design  comfort  quality  continued technological improvements  brand awareness  and timeliness of product delivery are the overriding characteristics that consumers demand 
by attention to these factors  we believe that the danner footwear line has maintained a strong competitive position in our market niches 
several rubber boot marketers with strong brand recognition in their respective markets are competitors of the lacrosse brand 
we occupy a favorable niche in the higher price segments of the work and outdoor rubber boot markets 
our history of supplying quality rubber boots  all of which are currently sourced from overseas suppliers  has provided a foundation to compete effectively 
other suppliers offer similar products  some at lower prices and quality levels  against which we must effectively compete 
we believe that our superior quality products  innovation and design leadership  coupled with solid delivery and customer support enables us to effectively compete in this market 
employees as of december   we had approximately employees located in the united states  nine employees in china and five in denmark  substantially all of whom are full time 
approximately twenty of our employees at the la crosse  wisconsin distribution center are represented by the united steel workers of america under a three year collective bargaining agreement  which expires in september approximately employees in our portland  oregon facilities are represented by the united food commercial workers union ufcw under a collective bargaining agreement that expired in january the ufcw bargaining agreement was renewed in january and will expire in january trademarks and trade names  patents we own united states federal registrations for several of our marks  including lacrosse  danner  burly  alpha burly  red ball  rainfair  the stylized indianhead design that serves as our logo  firetech  ice king  iceman  airthotic  gamemaster  terra force  hyper dri  camohide tm  acadia  quad comfort  striker  pronghorn tm  red ball jets  tfx tm  and dxtvent 
we generally attempt to register a trademark relating to a product s name only when we intend to heavily promote the product or where we expect to sell the product in large volumes 
however  we rely on common law trademark rights for all unregistered brands 
we defend our trademarks and trade names against infringement to the fullest extent practicable under the law 
we also own several united states patents  including terra force  a cement and stitch down manufacturing process  and our airthotic ventilated arch support that fits under the heel 
our newest platform outsole midsole construction process  exo tm  is patent pending at this time 
seasonality sales have been historically higher in the second half of the year due primarily to greater consumer demand for our outdoor product offerings during the fall and winter months 
accordingly  the amount of fixed operating expenses represents a larger percentage of net sales in the first two quarters than in the last two quarters of each year 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the coming periods 
we place orders for products sourced from overseas suppliers during the first quarter with anticipated deliveries starting late in the second quarter 
as a result  our inventories generally peak early in the third quarter  and then trend down to the end of year 

table of contents factors other than seasonality could have a significant impact on our sales backlog and therefore  our backlog at any one point in time may not be indicative of future results 
foreign operations and sales outside of the united states as previously noted  we maintain offices in china and denmark to support our contract manufacturers and european sales staff  respectively 
our net sales outside of the unites states are through our own european distributor and a focused set of independent distributors  and such sales accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
included in the company s consolidated balance sheets at december  are the net assets of the company s european subsidiary which total approximately million 
the net book value of fixed assets located outside of the us totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
such assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets and office equipment and software 
environmental matters we are subject to environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to waterways and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
such laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is difficult to accurately assess the effect they will have on our operations in the future 
compliance with federal  state and local requirements which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had  nor are they anticipated to have in the future  a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position

risk factors in evaluating the company  careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors  in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k 
each of these risk factors could adversely affect the company s business  operating results and or financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company s common stock 
in addition to the following disclosures  please refer to the other information contained in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the current slow down of consumer spending is negatively impacting our domestic retailers  which impacts their financial operations and their access to capital to fund growth  which increases and concentrates our credit risk 
certain of our retailers have announced significantly lower growth expectations and in some cases are reducing the number of stores in operation 
both the contraction in consumer spending and the tightening of the credit markets have created an unfavorable business environment for our retailers  especially the retailers who use debt to finance their inventory purchases and other operating capital requirements 
if our retailers are unable to obtain financing for their inventory purchases and to fund their operations  it could result in delayed payment or non payment of amounts owed to us and or a reduction in the number of sales we make to such retailers  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
for all of our distribution channels  including domestic retailers  a decline in consumer spending due to unfavorable economic and consumer credit conditions could create an environment of increasing price discounts which would negatively impact our product revenues  gross margins and earnings 
our success in generating sales of our products to consumers depends upon a number of factors  including economic factors impacting disposable consumer income 
these factors include economic conditions and factors such as employment  general business conditions  consumer confidence  prevailing interest rates and changes in tax laws 
in addition  spending patterns of consumers may be affected by changes in the amount or severity of inclement weather  the acceptability of us brands in international markets and the growth or decline of global footwear markets 
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending or economic conditions 
sales to the us government  which are becoming an increasingly significant portion of our net sales  may not continue at current levels  or we may not be able to fill these orders due to facility constraints 
our ability to continue to generate sales growth in this channel is partially dependent upon the current us presidential administration s policies regarding troop deployments in various global regions requiring our specialized footwear 
additionally  given that a substantial portion of our military sales must be produced by our domestic manufacturing facility  we may be unable to fill orders which we receive due to constraints in the capacity of that facility 
being unable to fill orders on a timely basis could cause us to lose future orders from these sources 
given that such orders can be sporadic  we may incur fixed costs associated with this operation even if the orders do not support such levels of fixed costs 
if government orders do not continue at current levels  or if we are unable to fill orders  it would have a negative impact on our earnings growth and results of operations 

table of contents changes in the price or availability of raw materials could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results  particularly our gross margins 
we purchase raw materials and component parts from various suppliers to be used in the manufacturing of our products 
changes in our relationships with suppliers or increases in the costs of purchased raw materials or component parts could result in manufacturing interruptions  delays  inefficiencies or our inability to successfully market our products 
these occurrences would negatively affect our business  product gross margins and results of operations 
our product costs are subject to risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations particularly with respect to the euro and chinese renminbi  oil price increases and higher foreign labor costs 
if we are unable to increase our selling prices to offset such cost increases  our revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted 
if petroleum costs were to increase it could result in significantly higher freight costs to our company  as we rely on transport companies to deliver our products from abroad to our distribution centers  and in some cases directly to our customers 
increased petroleum costs also affect our manufacturing costs  as rubber is a key component of our footwear 
foreign currency fluctuations and increased labor cost abroad would be problematic given our dependence on manufacturing in china and distribution through our european subsidiary 
our profit margins may decrease as foreign currency fluctuates or prices of petroleum and foreign labor increase and we are unable to pass on those additional costs to our customers 
we have experienced sequential quarterly declines in our gross margins in our gross margins could continue to experience pressure in due to conditions in the current retail environment 
we are experiencing consolidation in our raw materials supply base for outsoles and leather  which presents overall risks in our supply base 
interruptions in supply of raw materials or increased costs for such raw materials could negatively impact both our domestic manufacturing facility as well as products produced by our international manufacturing partners  both of which could negatively impact our customer relationships  our ability to fill current and future orders and our results of operations 
our business could be negatively affected by delays or disruptions in the transition to our new distribution facility 
we plan to close our two distribution centers in la crosse  wisconsin and open our new distribution center in indianapolis  indiana during the first half of if the final construction of the new facility and the related operating systems are delayed  or if the transition of inventories between the locations is interrupted  we may experience disruptions in shipping products to our customers or higher initial start up costs than originally planned 
any such delay or disruption would adversely affect our results of operations 
our newly established european subsidiary  lacrosse europe aps  increases our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations and the transition of customers to our new subsidiary may not be successful 
foreign operations through our european subsidiary increases our exposure to risks associated with foreign currency transactions and compliance with foreign laws 
additionally  if we fail to successfully transition our european customer base from our former european distributor to our newly established subsidiary  we could lose existing customers or be required to grant additional customer incentives which are less favorable than the incentives we provided to our prior distribution partner 
also  our distribution center for europe is owned and 
table of contents managed by an independent third party  which increases our risks associated with inventory management and timely and accurate customer shipments 
any negative outcome related to these risks would harm our results of operations 
our profitability is significantly dependent upon future effective tax rates for federal  state and international taxing jurisdictions 
the new us president s administration has indicated that tax rates on corporations may be increased in coming periods 
higher effective us tax rates would lower our earnings performance and restrict our ability to invest in various areas of our business 
future changes to rates of taxation in areas outside of the us could also negatively impact our future earnings performance 
we conduct a significant portion of our manufacturing activities and a certain portion of our net sales occurs outside the us  and therefore  we are subject to the risks of international commerce 
also  any adverse political conditions or governmental actions  including the imposition of duties and quotas  internally within china where the majority of our third party manufacturers are concentrated or externally with the united states and europe could disrupt our supply of product to customers 
we use third party manufacturers located in foreign countries  primarily in china  to manufacture the majority of our products  including all of our lacrosse branded products 
foreign manufacturing and sales activities are subject to numerous risks  including the following delays associated with the manufacture  transportation and delivery of foreign sourced products  tariffs  import and export controls and other non tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules  delays in the transportation and delivery of goods due to increased security concerns  foreign currency fluctuations particularly with respect to the euro and chinese renminbi  a risk which we do not currently seek to mitigate through hedging transactions  restrictions on the transfer of funds  changing economic conditions  restrictions  due to privacy laws  on the handling and transfer of consumer and other personal information  changes in governmental policies and regulations  political unrest  terrorism or war  any of which can interrupt commerce  expropriation and nationalization  difficulties in managing foreign operations effectively and efficiently from the us  difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws  regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions  limited capital of foreign distributors and the possibility that such distributors may terminate their operations or their relationships with us  and concentration of credit risk  currency  and political risks associated with international distributors 
international distributors represented of our net sales in additionally  although net sales outside of the us did not constitute a significant portion of our revenues in  we expect our international sales will grow over the next few years 
our ability to continue to do business in international markets is subject to risks associated with international sales operations  as noted above  as well as the difficulties associated with promoting products in emerging markets 
we are also subject to additional risk as the company has a limited number of foreign distributors  who may have inadequate capital to continue operations over the long term 
sales to the international markets are achieved through those foreign distributors and our wholly owned subsidiary 
the company s sales and sales growth may be adversely affected if the 
table of contents relationships with those distributors were to deteriorate and we are unable to engage suitable alternatives in a timely manner 
because we depend on third party manufacturers  we face challenges in maintaining a timely supply of goods to meet sales demand  and we may experience delay or interruptions in our supply chain 
any shortfall or delay in the supply of our products may decrease our sales and have an adverse impact on our customer relationships 
third party manufacturers produce approximately three fourths of our footwear products 
currently  we manufacture footwear with third party manufacturers primarily located in china  thailand and the netherlands 
we depend on these manufacturers ability to finance the production of goods ordered and to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity 
we do not exert direct control over the third party manufacturers  so we may be unable to obtain timely delivery of acceptable products 
due to various potential factors outside of our control  one or more of our third party manufacturers may be unable to continue meeting our production requirements 
also  certain of our third party manufacturers have manufacturing engagements with companies that are much larger than we are and whose production needs are much greater than ours 
as a result  such manufacturers may choose to devote additional resources to the production of products other than ours if capacity is limited 
in addition  we do not have long term supply contracts with these third party manufacturers  and any of them could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us at any time or seek to increase the prices they charge us 
as a result  we are not assured of an uninterrupted supply of products of an acceptable quality and price from our third party manufacturers 
we may be unable to offset any interruption or decrease in supply of our products by increasing production in our company operated manufacturing facilities due to capacity constraints  and we may be unable to substitute suitable alternative third party manufacturers in a timely manner or at acceptable prices 
any disruption in the supply of products from our third party manufacturers may harm our business and could result in a loss of sales and an increase in production costs  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is substantially affected by weather conditions  and sustained periods of warm and or dry weather can negatively impact our sales 
additionally  such weather conditions may negatively impact our inventory levels and subsequent period sales 
we sell our products into two primary markets  work and outdoor 
for the year ended december   of our annual revenues were to the outdoor market 
this market segment is highly seasonal and weather dependent 
sales of these products are largely dependent on the timing and severity of weather in the different regions of the united states and europe 
during sustained periods of warm and or dry weather conditions  certain key categories in the outdoor market may be negatively impacted  including hunting  hiking and cold weather products  as consumers postpone participation in those activities pending the resumption of more conducive weather patterns 
additionally  given our advance ordering timelines  such reduced demand during normal outdoor market seasons may also negatively impact our inventory levels and subsequent period profits as such excess inventories are sold 
failure to efficiently import foreign sourced products could result in decreased margins  cancelled orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation 
our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner 
as a result  we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide 
labor disputes at various ports create significant risks for our business  particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns  lockouts  strikes  or other disruptions during our peak importing seasons  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  
table of contents potentially resulting in cancelled orders by customers  unanticipated inventory accumulation  and reduced revenues and earnings 
furthermore  many of our imported products are subject to duties  tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states or into our other sales markets 
the countries in which our products are produced or sold may adjust or impose new quotas  duties  tariffs or other restrictions  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
if we do not accurately forecast consumer demand  we may have excess inventory to liquidate or have greater difficulty filling our customers orders  either of which could adversely affect our business 
the footwear industry is subject to cyclical variations and declines in performance  as well as fashion risks and rapid changes in consumer preferences  the effects of weather  general economic conditions and other factors affecting demand 
furthermore  the footwear industry has relatively long lead times for the design and manufacture of products 
consequently  we must commit to production based on our forecasts of consumer demand 
if we overestimate demand for our products  we may be forced to liquidate excess inventories at a discount to customers  resulting in markdowns and lower gross margins 
conversely  if we underestimate consumer demand  we could have inventory shortages  which can result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strains on our relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
a decline in demand for our products  or any failure on our part to satisfy increased demand for our products  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
labor disruptions or disruptions due to natural disasters or casualty losses at one of our distribution facilities or our domestic manufacturing facility could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
some of our employees at our distribution and manufacturing facilities are organized in labor unions 
our inability to renew on favorable terms the collective bargaining agreements between us and the unions that represent our employees  or any strike  work stoppage or other labor disruption could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  any natural disaster or other serious disruption at one of these facilities due to fire  earthquake  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or manmade cause could damage a portion of our inventory or impair our ability to use our warehouse as a docking location for our products 
any of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our financial success may be limited by the strength of our relationships with our retail customers and by the success of such retail customers 
our financial success is significantly related to the willingness of our retail customers to continue to carry our products and to the success of such customers in selling our products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our retail customers  and sales to our retail customers are generally on an order by order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the customer 
if we cannot fill our retail customers orders in a timely manner  the sales of our products and our relationships with those customers may suffer  and this could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and ability to grow our product line 
our five largest retail customers accounted for approximately one fifth of our revenues in if any of our major retail customers experiences a significant downturn in their business or fails to remain committed to our products or brands  then these customers may reduce or discontinue purchases from us 
in addition  we extend credit to our customers based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition 
if a significant customer 
table of contents to whom we have extended credit experiences financial difficulties  our bad debt expense may increase relative to revenues in the future  which would adversely impact our net income and cash flow 
we face significant competition and if we are unable to compete effectively  sales of our products may decline and our business could be harmed 
the footwear industry is highly competitive 
some of our competitors have products with similar characteristics  such as design and materials  to a number of our products 
in addition  access to offshore manufacturing is also making it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete 
our competitors include footwear manufacturers  fashion oriented footwear marketers  vertically integrated specialty stores and retailers of private label products 
the principal competitive differentiators in our industry include product design  product performance  quality  brand image  price  marketing and promotion  customer support and service  the ability to meet delivery commitments to retailers  obtaining access to retail outlets and sufficient floor space 
a number of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we have  more comprehensive product lines than ours  broader market presence than we have in retail outlets  or have their own retail outlets  greater distribution capabilities than we have  stronger brand recognition than we have  and substantially greater product advertising budgets than we do 
our competitors greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry  compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products 
in addition  a major marketing or promotional success or technological innovation by one of our competitors could adversely impact our competitive position 
if we fail to compete successfully in the future  our sales and profits may decline and our financial condition may deteriorate 
in addition  a growing trend in the footwear industry is for dealers and distributors to source product directly from overseas manufacturers in order to increase profitability by eliminating the wholesale distributor or manufacturer 
while dealers and distributors have not historically manufactured and developed new and innovative products  if consumers largely accept the directly sourced products  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may be unable to meet changing consumer preferences and demands 
the footwear industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences 
our success depends in large part on our ability to continuously develop  market and deliver innovative and functional products that are competitive with other brands in our market 
in addition  we must design and manufacture products that appeal to many consumer segments at a range of price points 
while we continually update our product line with new and innovative products  our products may not continue to be popular and new products we introduce may not achieve adequate consumer acceptance for us to recover development  manufacturing  marketing and other costs 
our failure to anticipate  identify and react to shifts in consumer preferences and maintain a strong brand image could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position and reduce future revenues 
protecting our intellectual property is an important factor in maintaining our brand and our competitive position in the footwear industry 
if we do not or are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 
we currently hold a number of patents and trademarks and have 
table of contents patent and trademark applications pending 
however  our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate and applicable laws provide only limited protection 
we have a number of licensing agreements  both for product  camouflage patterns and trademarks  which are significant to our business 
if the company is unable to renew the agreements  and suitable replacements are not available in a timely manner  this may reduce revenues 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key production materials  and any disruption in the supply of such materials could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs 
we depend on a limited number of sources for the primary materials used to make our footwear 
for example  we and our suppliers purchase gore tex waterproof fabric directly from wl gore and associates gore  for both our lacrosse and danner footwear 
over three fourths of danner styles are gore tex lined 
while we consider our relationship with gore to be good  if gore were to terminate our agreements  the time required to obtain substitute materials could interrupt our production cycle 
further  consumers may be unwilling to accept any such replacement material 
any termination or delay in our supply of gore tex waterproof fabric or the loss of our ability to use the gore tex mark in association with our products  or in the procurement of any other key product component  could result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strained relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
in order to be successful  we must retain and motivate key employees  and the failure to do so could have an adverse impact on our business 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel  including joseph p 
schneider  our president and chief executive officer  and david p 
carlson  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain key managers  product development engineers  sales people  and others 
we face intense competition for such individuals throughout the footwear and work and outdoor products industries 
not being able to attract or retain these employees could have a material adverse effect on revenues and earnings 
if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facility we may be unable to maintain existing  or secure additional financing  and repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness may be accelerated 
our revolving credit facility contains financial and operating covenants with which we must comply 
our continued compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial results  which are subject to fluctuation as described elsewhere in these risk factors 
if we fail to comply with the covenants in the future or if our lender does not agree to waive any future non compliance  we may be unable to borrow funds and any outstanding indebtedness could become immediately due and payable  which could harm our business 
at december  we had no outstanding borrowing under this credit facility 
our articles of incorporation  bylaws and wisconsin corporate law each contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management 
among other things  these provisions classify our board of directors so that only some of our directors are elected each year  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and establish advance notice and other procedural requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting 
table of contents these provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions  which may prevent a change of control and or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable 
in addition  subchapter xi of the wisconsin business corporation law includes provisions that may discourage  delay  or prevent a change in control of us 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our mission is to maximize the work and outdoor experience for our consumers 
to achieve this  we design  develop  manufacture and market premium quality  high performance footwear and apparel  supported by compelling marketing and superior customer service 
within the domestic and international retail channel of distribution  we market footwear and apparel under the danner and lacrosse brands 
we also sell products through the safety and industrial distributor channel principally under the lacrosse brand for consumers who regard our specialized footwear as critical tools for the job 
additionally  we position the danner brand as performance footwear built to meet the unique demands and specific requirements for multiple branches of the us armed forces 
we focus on two types of consumers for our footwear and apparel lines work and outdoor 
work customers include people in law enforcement  transportation  mining  oil and gas  military services and other occupations that need high performance and protective footwear as a critical tool for the job 
outdoor customers include people active in hunting  outdoor cross training  hiking and other outdoor recreational activities 
weather  especially in the fall and winter  has been  and will likely continue to be  a significant contributing factor impacting our financial performance 
sales are typically higher in the second half of the year due to stronger demand for our cold and wet weather outdoor product offerings 
we augment these offerings by infusing innovative technology into all product categories with the intent to create additional demand in all four quarters of the year 
we have achieved consistent growth in our core business in recent years  driven by our consumers demand for our innovative footwear and apparel products 
our sales growth included our previously announced revenue of million for shipments to the united states marine corps and the us army 
in addition to our government channel  our net sales performance continues to be driven by the success of our new product lines  our ability to meet at once demand and our ability to diversify and strengthen our portfolio of sales channels 
during  we experienced slight sequential declines in our gross margins 
we anticipate continued pressure on gross margins during given the current economic and retail environment

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded working capital requirements and capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit agreement or other long term lending arrangements 
we require working capital to support fluctuating accounts receivable and inventory levels caused by our seasonal business cycle 
working capital requirements are generally the lowest in the first quarter and the highest during the third quarter 
we have a line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which expires on june  amounts borrowed under the agreement are secured by all of our assets 
the maximum aggregate principal amount of borrowings allowed from january to may is million and from june to december  the total available is million 
there are no borrowing base limitations under the credit agreement 
at our option  the credit agreement provides for interest rate options of prime rate minus or libor plus 
no amounts were outstanding under this agreement during see note  financing arrangements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in june  we received a grant of million and a non interest bearing loan of million from the portland development commission  which were used to finance certain leasehold improvements at our portland distribution facility 
the grant is recorded as deferred revenue and is being amortized as a reduction of operating expenses on a straight line basis over five years  which is the estimated useful life of the associated leasehold improvements 
in the third quarter of  the loan was forgiven by the portland development commission as we met certain facility usage requirements and employment criteria  including maintaining a minimum number of employees in the city of portland  oregon and paying those employees a competitive specified wage and benefits package 
given the forgiveness of this loan  we have reclassified the remaining unamortized long term debt to deferred revenue and will continue to amortize the balance until see note  financing arrangements to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information

we anticipate spending million on capital expenditures during net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million in  
table of contents compared to million for we paid cash dividends of million in compared to million in as previously noted  on february   we announced a first quarter cash dividend of twelve and one half cents per common share which will be paid on march  to shareholders of record on february  and will approximate million in aggregate 
at december  and  our pension plan had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the respective plan assets of million and million  respectively 
this obligation in excess of plan assets and accrued liabilities resulted in a cumulative reduction of equity  net of tax  of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to contribute million to the pension plan in we will consolidate our two la crosse  wisconsin distribution facilities in the second quarter of to one location in indianapolis  indiana for increased capacity and operating efficiencies 
we anticipate spending approximately million by the end of the second quarter of for capital assets related to building out this new midwest consolidated distribution facility including racking  computer systems and other build out costs 
we have evaluated the capital assets in our two distribution centers in la crosse and have determined that no impairment exists as of december  in the first half of  we expect approximately million in additional operating expenses related to our new midwest distribution center 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than property operating leases that are disclosed in the contractual obligations table below and in our consolidated financial statements  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any special purpose entities established by us  at our direction or for our benefit 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter operating leases see part i  item properties for a description of our leased facilities 
in june  we signed a single tenant industrial lease to move from our la crosse  wisconsin distribution operation to a newly constructed   square foot building in indianapolis  indiana 
the monthly base rent on the lease is scheduled for months beginning march  additionally  in december   we signed a lease agreement for  square feet of office space in copenhagen  denmark as our sales  marketing and customer service headquarters for our european operations 
from time to time  we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 

table of contents we also have a commercial line of credit as described below  which is more fully described under the caption liquidity and capital resources in thousands other commercial maximum amount commitment committed outstanding at date of expiration line of credit  june  we believe that our existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require management to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  known trends in our industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
allowances for doubtful accounts  cash discounts and non defective returns according to our standard sales agreement  ownership of our products transfers to the customer when the product is delivered to a third party carrier at one of our distribution facilities 
therefore  the amount of revenue recognized does not require a material level of judgment or subjectivity 
however  significant judgment is required when determining the allowances for doubtful accounts  cash discounts  and non defective returns  each of which reduces the amount of accounts receivable and operating income reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our historical experience of write offs of uncollectible accounts has been insignificant 
however  based on our assessments of payment histories and current creditworthiness of our customers  we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  and million at december  in addition to an allowance for doubtful accounts  we maintain allowances for anticipated cash discounts to be taken by customers and for non defective returns 
cash discounts are provided under certain customer service programs and are estimated based on available programs and historical usage rates 
reserves for non defective returns are estimated based on historical rates of return 
these combined reserves total million at december  and million at december  allowance for slow moving inventory provision for potentially slow moving or excess inventories is made based on our analysis of inventory levels  future sales forecasts and current estimated market values 
actual customer requirements in any future periods are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
these reserves total million at both december  and product warranty we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products for a specified time period after sale 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold and historical and anticipated future rates of warranty claims 
we also utilize information received from customers to assist in determining the appropriate warranty accrual levels  which were million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents valuation of long lived and intangible assets as a matter of policy  we review our major assets for impairment at least annually  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our major long lived and intangible assets are goodwill  and property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment over their estimated useful lives 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill of million and the investments we have made in property and equipment  we have analyzed our market capitalization together with assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective operating units or assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
please refer to the risk factors in part i  item a for a discussion of factors that may have an effect on our ability to attain future levels of product sales and cash flows 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note  compensation and benefit agreements to our annual consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or material changes in our assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations  our future expense and shareholders equity 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a in this annual report on form k for further sensitivity analysis regarding our estimated pension obligation 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance our deferred taxes are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance at december  and of million and million  respectively  is related to the state of wisconsin net operating loss nol carryforwards  realization of which is dependent upon having taxable income in wisconsin in future periods 
given our planned relocation of our midwest distribution center during the second quarter of  the remaining balance of the deferred taxes after such valuation allowance represents the portion of wisconsin nol s which management believes is more likely than not to be realized prior to the relocation 
we also have a deferred tax asset related to our european subsidiary losses incurred in such nol s have an indefinite carryforward 
no valuation allowance has been provided as we believe that the future realization of this asset is more likely than not 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment on january  sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of income over the requisite service periods 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  share based compensation expense is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
to calculate the share based compensation expense under sfas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of option based awards on the date of grant is impacted by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding certain highly subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the anticipated risk free interest rate  
table of contents anticipated future dividend yields and the expected life of the options 
the anticipated risk free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options granted 
the expected volatility  life of options and dividend yield are based on historical experience 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas was effective for us in but we did not elect to apply its fair value reporting to any of our accounts 
in december  the fasb issued fsp fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
fsp fas r requires more detailed disclosures about employers plan assets in a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan  including employers investment strategies  major categories of plan assets  concentrations of risk within plan assets  and inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets 
fsp fas r also requires  for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  disclosure of the effect of the measurements on changes in plan assets for the period 
the disclosures about plan assets required by fsp fas r must be provided for fiscal years ending after december  as this pronouncement is only disclosure related  it will not have an impact on the financial position and results of operations but will affect the disclosures within our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates 
at our option  our line of credit interest rate is either the prime rate minus or the libor rate plus 
we are exposed to market risk related to interest rates 
based on an average floating rate borrowing of million  a one percent change in the applicable rate would impact the company s interest expense by approximately million 
we are also exposed to market risk related to the assumptions we make in estimating our pension liability 
the assumed discount rate used  in part  to calculate the pension plan obligation is related to the prevailing long term interest rates 
at december   we used an estimated discount rate of 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would result in an increase in the actuarial present value of projected pension benefits of approximately million at december  with a similar charge to equity 
at december   we used an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
the historical annualized ten year rate of return on pension plan assets is approximately 
a one percent change increase or decrease in the actual rate of return on pension plan assets would affect the charge to equity by approximately million 

table of contents our financial market risk arises from fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in exchange rates through the sale of products denominated in non functional foreign currencies 
our purchases of inventory are largely denominated in us dollars and we anticipate that we will continue to purchase in us dollars in the foreseeable future  therefore we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on these purchases and our exposure through foreign currency denominated transactions is not material 
our net investment exposure in our foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in recorded value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  at december  we had no formal plans to liquidate any of our operating foreign subsidiaries within of the consolidated group  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not affect our results of operations
