our future financial condition  as well as any forward looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the factors set forth under the heading item ia risk factors of this annual report on form k 
all forward looking statements are made as of the date hereof  and  unless required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report  which have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
the terms we  us  our and similar terms refer to array biopharma inc overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat patients afflicted with cancer  inflammatory and metabolic diseases 
our proprietary drug development pipeline includes clinical candidates that are designed to regulate therapeutically important target proteins 
in addition  leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies partner with us to discover and develop drug candidates across a broad range of therapeutic areas 
the seven most advanced wholly owned programs in our development pipeline are as follows arry  a glucokinase activator for type diabetes arry  a mek inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  and cancer arry  an erbb inhibitor for breast cancer arry  a ksp inhibitor for acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  and multiple myeloma  or mm arry  a p tie dual inhibitor for myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds arry  an erbb family erbb egfr inhibitor for solid tumors arry  a p inhibitor for subacute pain and cancer supportive care indications we also have a portfolio of drug discovery programs that we believe will generate one to two investigational new drug  or ind  applications in fiscal our discovery efforts have also generated 
table of contents additional early stage drug candidates and we may choose to out license select promising candidates through research partnerships prior to filing an ind application 
we have built our proprietary pipeline of research and development programs on an investment of million from our inception through june  we continue to commit significant resources to create our own proprietary drug candidates and to build a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company 
in fiscal  we continued our investment in proprietary research and spent million in research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses  compared to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
in light of ongoing uncertainty in the capital markets as well as general economic conditions that have negatively affected the biopharmaceutical market  we determined in the second half of fiscal to reduce the pace of our spending on our proprietary discovery and development programs to focus on advancing our most promising clinical programs through proof of concept  which we believe will maximize their value  and  on our most promising discovery candidates 
we are also accelerating our efforts to partner select discovery and development programs with collaborators that will provide funding  development and commercial resources  with the goal of optimizing the value of our drug portfolio 
as part of these efforts  we reduced our workforce in january by approximately employees who were primarily in discovery research and support positions  resulting in a restructuring charge of approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of this strategy  we expect the level of our spending on research and development for proprietary drug discovery to remain relatively constant for fiscal as compared to the last half of fiscal we currently expect that cash used in operations will be approximately million per quarter during fiscal if we do not receive any milestone payments when anticipated under existing collaborations or any up front license payments under new collaborations  however  we will be required to further reduce our costs by approximately million during fiscal to avoid accelerating our repayment obligations under our credit facility with deerfield and our loan agreement with comerica bank 
we have received a total of million in research funding and in up front and milestone payments from our collaboration partners through june  under our existing collaboration agreements  we have the potential to earn over billion in additional milestone payments if we or our collaborators achieve all the drug discovery objectives detailed in those agreements  as well as the potential to earn royalties on any resulting product sales from drug development programs 
our significant existing collaborators include genentech  inc  which entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with us to develop two of our cancer programs which has been expanded to include three additional programs all five of which are in preclinical development  celgene corporation  which entered into a worldwide strategic collaboration agreement with us focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics in cancer and inflammation  astrazeneca  plc  which licensed three of our mek inhibitors for cancer  including azd arry  which is currently in multiple phase clinical trials 
our fiscal year ends on june when we refer to a fiscal year or quarter  we are referring to the year in which the fiscal year ends and the quarters during that fiscal year 
therefore  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents business development and collaborator concentrations we currently license or partner certain of our compounds and or programs and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in addition  we may license our compounds and enter into collaborations in japan through an agent 
we had two  four and four collaborators that contributed greater than of total revenue for each of the last three fiscal years  respectively as follows years ended june  genentech celgene ventirx astrazeneca ono intermune in general  certain of our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreements with to days prior notice 
our agreement with genentech can be terminated with days notice 
celgene may terminate its agreement with us with six months notice 
the following table details revenue from our collaborators by region based on the country in which collaborators are located or the ship to destination for compounds in thousands years ended june  north america europe asia pacific all of our collaboration agreements are denominated in us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our accompanying financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 

table of contents below is a discussion of the policies and estimates that we believe involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition most of our revenue is in the form of research funding  up front or license fees and milestone payments derived from designing  creating  optimizing  evaluating and developing drug candidates for our collaborators 
our agreements with our collaboration partners include fees based on contracted annual rates for full time equivalent employees working on a project  and may also include non refundable license and up front fees  non refundable milestone payments that are triggered upon achievement of specific research or development goals  and future royalties on sales of products that result from the collaboration 
a small portion of our revenue comes from sales of compounds on a per compound basis 
we report revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as collaboration revenue 
license and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
sab established four criteria  each of which must be met  in order to recognize revenue related to the performance of services or the shipment of products 
revenue is recognized when a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b products are delivered or services are rendered  c the sales price is fixed or determinable and d collectability is reasonably assured 
collaboration agreements that include a combination of research funding  up front or license fees  milestone payments and or royalties are evaluated to determine whether each deliverable under the agreement has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether reliable evidence of fair value for the deliverable exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria are treated as a single unit of accounting  generally applying applicable revenue recognition guidance for the final deliverable to the combined unit of accounting in accordance with sab we recognize revenue from non refundable up front payments and license fees on a straight line basis over the term of performance under the agreement  which is generally the research term specified in the agreement 
these advance payments are deferred and recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt  pending recognition  and are classified as a short term or long term liability on our accompanying balance sheets 
when the performance period is not specifically identifiable from the agreement  we estimate the performance period based upon provisions contained within the agreement  such as the duration of the research term  the specific number of full time equivalent scientists working a defined number of hours per year at a stated price under the agreement  the existence  or likelihood of achievement  of development commitments  and other significant commitments of ours 
we determined that the performance period applicable to our agreement with celgene corporation is seven years ending september we determined the performance period for our collaboration and licensing agreement with ventirx to be one year  which ended in march each of these periods coincides with the research terms specified in each licensing agreement 
under our agreement with ventirx  we received a non refundable cash technology access fee and shares of preferred stock valued at million based on the price at which such preferred stock was sold to investors in a private offering 
both the technology access fee and the value of the preferred stock were recorded as advance payments from collaborators in deferred revenue  and were recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated one year research term 
the preferred stock is recorded in other long term assets in the accompanying balance sheets 

table of contents similarly to advance payments  for agreements that provide for milestone payments  a portion of each milestone payment is recognized as revenue when the specific milestone is achieved based on the applicable percentage of the estimated research term that has elapsed to the total estimated research term 
we periodically review the expected performance periods under each of our agreements that provide for non refundable up front payments and license fees and milestone payments 
to date  there has not been a significant change in an estimate or assumption of the expected period of performance that has had a material effect on the timing or amount of revenue recognized 
revenue recognition related to non refundable license fees and up front payments and to milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs 
revenue from sales of optimer building blocks is recognized as the compounds are shipped 
we recognize revenue that is based on contracted annual rates for full time equivalent employees working on a project on a monthly basis as work is performed 
cost of revenue and research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses we incur costs in connection with performing research and development activities which consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based compensation  preclinical and clinical outsourcing costs and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation costs and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
cost of revenue represents costs associated with research and development conducted for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold 
research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses consist of direct and indirect internal costs related to specific proprietary programs and related to programs under collaboration agreements which we have concluded are likely to retain the rights to  as well as fees paid to other entities that conduct research activities on our behalf for such programs 
we allocate costs between cost of revenue and research and development for proprietary drug discovery based upon the respective time spent on each by our scientists on development conducted for our collaborators and for our internal proprietary programs  respectively 
we do not bear any risk of failure for performing these activities and the payments are not contingent on the success or failure of the research program 
accordingly  we expense these costs when incurred 
where our collaboration agreements provide for us to conduct development of drug candidates  and for which our partner has an option to obtain the right to conduct further development and to commercialize a product  we attribute a portion of our research and development costs to cost of revenue based on the percentage of total programs under the agreement that we conclude is likely to be selected by the partner 
these costs may not be incurred equally across all programs 
in addition  we continually evaluate the progress of development activities under these agreements and if events or circumstances change in future periods that management reasonably believes would make it unlikely that a collaborator would exercise an option with respect to the same percentage of programs  we will adjust the allocation accordingly 
for example  we granted celgene an option to select up to two of four programs developed under the collaboration and have concluded that celgene is currently likely to exercise its option with respect to two of the four programs 
accordingly  we report costs associated with the celgene collaboration as follows to cost of revenue  with the remaining to research and development for proprietary drug discovery 

table of contents investments in marketable securities we have designated the marketable securities held by us as of june  and june  as available for sale securities 
these securities are accounted for at their respective fair value 
we use a framework for measuring fair value based on a hierarchy that distinguishes sources of available information used in fair value measurements and disclose assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy 
marketable securities that are readily available for use in current operations are classified as short term available for sale securities and are reported as a component of current assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
marketable securities that are not considered available for use in current operations are classified as long term available for sale securities and are reported as a component of long term assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
securities that are classified as available for sale are carried at fair value  including accrued interest  with temporary unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of stockholders equity deficit until their disposition 
we review all available for sale securities each period to determine if it is more likely than not that they will remain available for sale based on our intent and ability to sell the security 
the amortized cost of debt securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
realized gains and losses are reported in interest income and interest expense  respectively  in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss as incurred 
declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in impairment of marketable securities in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive loss as recognized 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
we have concluded that our investments in ars  amounting to seven securities with a par value of million and current fair value of million  are not available for use in current operations due to unsuccessful auctions and therefore have reported them as a component of long term assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
during the fiscal year ended june   auctions for all of the ars were unsuccessful 
the lack of successful auctions resulted in the interest rate on these investments increasing to libor plus additional basis points as stipulated in the auction rate agreements  ranging from to additional basis points as of june   which continued through all of fiscal while we now earn a higher contractual interest rate on these investments  the investments are not currently liquid and may not be liquid at a time when we need to access these funds 
we may need to access these funds and liquidate the ars prior to the time auctions of these investments are successful or the date on which the original issuers retire these securities 
in this event  we may be required to sell them in a distressed sale in a secondary market most likely for a lower amount than their current fair value 
the fair value for these securities is defined as the price that would be received to sell the securities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
since there was no active market data for our ars as of june   we estimated the fair values for these securities  using a discounted cash flow method under the income method approach 
under the fair value hierarchy  our ars are measured using level  or unobservable inputs  as there is no active market for the securities 
the most significant unobservable inputs used in this method are estimates of the amount of time until a liquidity event will occur and the discount rate  which incorporates estimates of credit risk and a liquidity premium discount 
in determining fair value  we analyzed the underlying structure and assets of each ars  the coupon interest rates  and the current interest rate market environment 
we also considered the valuations prepared by our third party investment advisor who maintains custody of these securities and 
table of contents conducts the related auctions 
during the first quarter of  our investment advisor was no longer able to provide valuation services 
due to the inherent complexity in valuing these securities  we engaged a third party valuation firm to perform an independent valuation of the ars in all four quarters of fiscal while we believe that the estimates used in our fair value analysis are reasonable  a change in any of the assumptions underlying these estimates would result in different fair value estimates for the ars and could result in additional impairment charges 
see note marketable securities to the accompanying financial statements for additional information about our investments in ars as well as other income expense in the results of operations discussion below 
accrued outsourcing costs substantial portions of our preclinical studies and clinical trials have been performed by third party medical centers or contract research organizations  which we refer to collectively as cros 
some cros bill monthly for services performed  while others bill based upon milestone achievement 
we accrue expenses each month for agreements involving significant costs and that bill based on milestone achievement 
for preclinical studies  accruals are based upon the estimated percentage of work completed and the contract milestones remaining 
for costs of clinical study activities performed by cros  accruals are estimated based upon the estimated work completed on each study and  for clinical trial expenses  accruals are based upon the number of patients enrolled and the expected duration of the study for which they will be enrolled 
we monitor patient enrollment and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with the cros  clinical site visits  and review of contractual terms 
our estimates are dependant upon the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by our cros regarding the status of each program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate our estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive concerning changing circumstances  conditions or events that may affect such estimates 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
long term debt as of june   our long term debt obligations consisted of a million term loan  million in standby letters of credit and million of equipment advances under our loan and security agreement with comerica bank and our million credit facility with deerfield 
the accounting for our long term debt arrangements is complex and subject to estimates by management 
we review all debt agreements to determine the appropriate accounting treatment when the agreement is entered into  as well as all amendments to determine if the changes require accounting for the amendment as a modification  or extinguishment and new debt 
we review our debt arrangements to determine if the debt is a hybrid instrument that is comprised of at least two components a debt host instrument and one or more conversion features 
additionally  we review the debt for any other embedded derivatives  such as warrants  or other rights of the debt holder 
all of the conversion features and embedded derivatives are reviewed individually  and related to the agreement as a whole  to determine if they require bifurcation and or separate valuation 
warrants  specifically  are reviewed to determine if they are considered liabilities or equity  and they are reported at their fair value 
any debt discounts recorded and transaction fees paid are amortized to interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income using the effective interest method over the term of the underlying debt 
for more information about the terms of our long term debt  please see note long term debt and note subsequent events to the accompanying financial statements

change vs 
collaboration revenue license and milestone revenue total revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased by million in fiscal primarily due to lower revenue of million related to the expiration our collaboration with ono pharmaceuticals and of thousand due to decreased activity under our collaboration with ventirx 
these declines were partially offset by an increase of thousand related to the expansion of the genentech collaboration in the first quarter of fiscal license and milestone revenue for the year remained relatively consistent with the prior year in total 
during fiscal  license and milestone revenue included an increase of million from additional license revenue following expansion of our collaboration with genentech and from additional milestone revenue received from genentech that was recognized in fiscal  and an increase in license revenue of million under our celgene collaboration  which did not begin until the second quarter of fiscal  and a decrease in license revenue of million that was fully recognized in under our program with ventirx 
fiscal as compared to fiscal collaboration revenue decreased by million due to the expiration of collaborations with intermune and takeda in june and march of  respectively  as well as the expiration of our collaboration with ono during the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  collaboration revenue from the sale of optimer building blocks decreased by approximately thousand compared to fiscal partially offsetting these decreases was increased revenue of approximately thousand from our collaborations with ventirx and genentech 
license and milestone revenue increased by approximately thousand due to increased revenue of million from our collaborations with celgene and ventirx 
largely offsetting this increase was the full recognition of two milestone payments totaling million from astrazeneca during fiscal cost of revenue cost of revenue represents costs attributable to research and development  including preclinical and clinical trials  we conduct for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold from our inventory 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits  share based

cost of revenue cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue decreased in absolute dollars but increased as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared with fiscal the increases in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to the decrease in license revenue from ventirx  which had no associated costs  and increased costs associated with advancement of our partnered programs  including our collaboration with celgene  as well as thousand in restructuring charges as discussed in note restructuring charges in the accompanying financial statements 
fiscal as compared to fiscal cost of revenue for fiscal decreased from fiscal as a result of a reduction in the number of scientists working on external collaborations that expired in the prior fiscal year 
these scientific resources were deployed in our proprietary drug research and the celgene collaboration upon expiration of these external collaborations 
half of the cost of the celgene program is charged to cost of revenue as discussed further in note deferred revenue in the accompanying financial statements 
research and development for proprietary drug discovery expenses our research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery include costs associated with our proprietary drug programs for scientific and clinical personnel  supplies  inventory  equipment  small tools  depreciation  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  and share based compensation 
we manage our proprietary programs based on scientific data and achievement of research plan goals 
our scientists record their time to specific projects when possible 
however  many activities simultaneously benefit multiple projects and cannot be readily attributed to a specific project 
accordingly  the accurate assignment of time and costs to a specific project is difficult and may not give a true indication of the actual costs of a particular project 
as a result  we do not report costs on a program basis

we expect our spending on research and development for our proprietary programs will remain relatively constant during fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses increased over the prior fiscal year as a result of the deployment of existing scientific personnel previously engaged in our external collaborations to advance our proprietary research 
in addition  we expanded our clinical development group and moved into more advanced clinical trials and increased the amount of outsourced pharmacology to advance our proprietary development compounds

see note marketable securities to the accompanying financial statements for additional information about our investments in our ars 
interest income decreased as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances

the thousand credit relates to research expenditures we made during fiscal and liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses and an accumulated deficit as a result of ongoing spending on research and development 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we had net losses of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we have historically funded our operations through revenue from our collaborations  the issuance of equity securities and through our credit facilities 
until we can generate sufficient levels of cash from our operations  which we do not expect to achieve in the foreseeable future  we will continue to utilize our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities that were generated primarily from these sources 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including the million disbursement received july  under our additional credit facility with deerfield capital discussed in note long term debt and note subsequent events to the accompanying financial statements  and excluding the value of the ars we hold  will enable us to continue to fund our operations for the next months assuming we obtain additional sources of funding as anticipated and or reduce our levels of spending 
this funding may include up front fees or research funding through new out licensing transactions  milestone payments on existing collaborations  and sales of equity securities or issuance of additional debt 
however  if we are unable to obtain additional funding to the extent or when needed  it will be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending through further reductions in staff and delaying  scaling back or eliminating certain research and development programs 
insufficient funds may also require us to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms to us or our stockholders than we would otherwise choose in order to obtain funding for further development and or up front license fees needed to fund our operations 
if we are unable to continue to fund our ongoing operations as a result of insufficient funds  our ability to continue as a going concern may be in substantial doubt 
during fiscal  we currently project using approximately million per quarter to fund our operations 
we expect that we can fund this level of operations for this period assuming that we use shares of our common stock to pay interest under our credit facility with deerfield capital 
however  if we fail to receive any milestone payments under existing collaboration agreements or up front payments under new collaborations  cost reductions of approximately million must be realized during fiscal in order to avoid the acceleration of our repayment obligations under our credit facility with deerfield capital and our loan with comerica bank  which require us to maintain certain levels of cash and marketable securities  as described in note long term debt to the accompanying financial statements 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining new or in retaining existing out license or collaboration agreements  in securing agreements for the co development of our proprietary drug candidates  or in receiving milestone and or royalty payments under those agreements when anticipated or at all  that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  this financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 

table of contents our ability to realize milestone or royalty payments under existing collaboration agreements  and to enter into new partnering arrangements that generate additional revenue through up front fees and milestone or royalty payments  is subject to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control and include the following the drug development process is risky and highly uncertain  and we may not be successful in generating proof of concept data to create partnering opportunities  and even if we are  we or our collaborators may not be successful in commercializing drug candidates we create  our collaborators have substantial control and discretion over the timing and continued development and marketing of drug candidates we create  the sale and manufacture of drug candidates we develop may not obtain regulatory approval  and  if regulatory approval is received  drugs we develop will remain subject to regulation or may not gain market acceptance  which could delay or prevent us from generating milestone  royalty revenue or product revenue from the commercialization of these drugs 
the estimate of our future capital requirements is a forward looking statement that is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
our actual future capital requirements could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the rate at which we invest in our development programs  our ability to enter into agreements to out license  co develop or commercialize our proprietary drug candidates  and the timing of payments under those agreements throughout each candidate s development stage  the number and scope of our research and development programs  the progress and success of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the number and scope of phase and phase clinical studies we may decide to run  the progress of the development efforts of our collaborators  our ability to establish and maintain current and new collaboration agreements  the ability of our collaborators to fund research and development programs  the costs involved in enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing clinical development and distribution or commercialization capabilities  and the expenses associated with unforeseen litigation  regulatory changes  competition and technological developments  general economic and market conditions and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses  products and technologies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices  the liquidity of ars we hold and fluctuations in interest rates 
all of our collaboration agreements and nearly all purchase orders are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  historically and as of june   we have had little or no exposure to market risk from changes in foreign currency or exchange rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investments in marketable securities 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of readily marketable  high quality securities diversified and structured to minimize market risks while providing a reasonable return on invested funds 
we target our average portfolio maturity at one year or less 
nevertheless  the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to changes in market value in response to changes in interest rates and liquidity 
as of june   million of our investment portfolio is invested in ars that are not marketable as discussed below 
in addition  a significant change in market interest rates could have a material impact on interest income earned from our investment portfolio 
given the current balance of million of investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities available for sale  a theoretical basis point change in interest rates and security prices would impact our annual net income loss positively or negatively by thousand 
our long term marketable securities investment portfolio includes ars 
during the fiscal year ended june  and subsequent thereto  auctions for all of our ars  amounting to seven securities with a 
table of contents par value of million and a current fair value of million  were unsuccessful 
due to the uncertainties in the credit markets  we recorded adjustments to our ars as follows unrealized gains unrealized losses realized losses net for the year ended june  for the quarter ended september  december  march  june  for the year ended june  if credit market liquidity conditions deteriorate further  we may experience additional impairments of our ars 
further  due to the volatility of the underlying credit markets  the fair value of the ars may continue to fluctuate 
in the event we need to access any of our ars prior to the time auctions of these investments are successful or the original issuers retire these securities  we will be required to sell them in a distressed sale in a secondary market  most likely for a significantly lower amount than their current fair value 
we are also impacted by adverse changes in interest rates relating to variable rate borrowings under our loan and security agreement with comerica bank 
we pay interest on advances under this agreement at one of three variable rates  which are adjusted periodically for changes in comerica bank s prime lending rate 
changes in prevailing interest rates will affect the fair value of our debt  and will impact future results of operations and cash flows 
as of june   we had million of debt outstanding  exclusive of the debt discount of million 
fifteen million of this debt was a variable rate term loan and equipment advance facilities under our senior secured credit facility with comerica bank 
the interest rate on the remainder of our long term debt including the additional draw of million received july   is fixed 
assuming constant debt levels  a theoretical change of basis points on our current interest rate of as of june  would result in a change in our annual interest expense of thousand 
historically  and as of june   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities
