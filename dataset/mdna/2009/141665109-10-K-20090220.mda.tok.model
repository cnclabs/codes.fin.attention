overview we are a global education company committed to quality outcomes and career opportunities for a diverse student population 
with over  students  we are a leading on ground provider of private  for profit  postsecondary education in the us and have a substantial presence in online education 
our schools and universities prepare students for careers through the operation of more than on ground campuses located throughout the united states and in france  italy and the united kingdom and three fully online academic programs 
overview we began the year with a company wide restructuring 
we removed duplicative management layers by eliminating the group president position and appointing senior executives to lead multi disciplinary strategic business units sbus 
we evaluate our business across five sbus and one operating division 
each sbu represents a group of for profit  postsecondary schools that offer a variety of degree and non degree academic programs 
these sbus are organized by key market segment to enhance brand focus and operational alignment within each segment 
we also created the transitional schools division to include all schools that are currently being taught out 
by appointing a leader over the transitional schools division  we are focused on winding down these operations as effectively and efficiently as possible 
as a result of this restructuring  we have six reportable segments university  culinary arts  health education  art design  international and transitional schools 
results of operations for all periods presented have been adjusted to align with these reportable segments 
university includes our american intercontinental university aiu  colorado technical university ctu and briarcliffe college schools that collectively offer regionally accredited academic programs in the career oriented disciplines of business studies  visual communications and design technologies  health education  information technology  criminal justice  and education in an online  classroom  or laboratory setting 
culinary arts includes our le cordon bleu lcb and kitchen academy schools that collectively offer culinary arts programs in the career oriented disciplines of culinary arts  baking and pastry arts  and hotel and restaurant management primarily in a classroom or kitchen setting

transitional schools includes those schools that are currently being taught out 
as of december   the following campuses were included within transitional schools mcintosh college  lehigh valley college  seven of the campuses that were part of the gibbs division  including gibbs colleges in cranston  ri  boston  ma  livingston  nj  norwalk and farmington  ct  and katharine gibbs schools in new york  ny and norristown  pa  and aiu los angeles  ca 
see note segment reporting of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in connection with our organizational changes and our announced plans to teach out certain campuses  eliminations of certain positions within the company were announced in our results included million for severance and stay bonuses associated with these actions 
of this charge  million is reflected within transitional schools  million is reflected within corporate and other  and approximately million is recorded within each culinary arts  art design and university 
the elimination of positions within transitional schools will take place over the course of the teach out period 
during we completed the teach out of four of our campuses  brooks college sunnyvale and long beach  ca  iadt pittsburgh  pa and gibbs college piscataway  nj and sold our iadt toronto  canada campus 
the results of operations for these campuses are reflected within discontinued operations 
in connection with the closure of the campuses  we recorded million in future minimum lease obligations related to certain of our facilities whose remaining lease terms range from three months to nine years 
we recorded a million gain on the sale of iadt toronto which occurred in june as campuses within transitional schools complete their teach out process  the results of operations for all periods presented will be reported as discontinued operations 
at the point in which each campus within transitional schools ceases operations  to the extent that the facility s lease has not ended  we would record a charge related to the estimated fair value of the remaining lease obligation 
currently  we estimate that these charges would be approximately million 
see note discontinued operations of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting for discontinued operations 
we have spent a considerable amount of time this year focused on student financial aid 
in the second quarter  we began to offer funding for eligible students in place of the recourse program that had previously been provided by sallie mae 
our recourse loan program offered by sallie mae terminated on march  we decided to provide payment plans directly to certain students to ensure that they can finish their existing educational programs with us and to allow new students the opportunity to attend our schools 
as of december   we have committed approximately million of funding through these payment plans 
as of december   million is reflected within accounts receivable  net on our audited consolidated balance sheets 
we continue to review other financing opportunities for our students 

table of contents in  we took steps to optimize our real estate footprint across the company 
the current year results of continuing operations include million in pretax charges associated with the exit of excess space and the termination of a lease for facilities within culinary arts  art design  transitional schools and university 
the pretax charge is comprised of million of lease termination and future minimum lease obligations  which is reflected within the educational services and facilities component of the consolidated statements of operations  and million of noncash asset impairment charges resulting from the write off of the remaining leasehold improvements and other related equipment within the facilities that were exited 
as of december   four of our campuses were in the start up stage 
our lcb boston  ma campus began instructing students in the second quarter  and our kitchen academy campus seattle  wa  began instructing students in the third quarter our sanford brown institute in san antonio  tx and lcb st 
louis  mo campuses are expected to begin instructing students in the second quarter we continue to look for opportunities to expand our presence both in the us and internationally 
as we exit  we have made a considerable amount of progress against our strategic choices of growing our core educational institutions  entering new markets  improving academic and operational effectiveness  building our reputation and external relationships and growing and developing our people

culinary arts and art design s student populations declined in as compared to the prior year due in part to the loss of third party student loan financing for certain students 
this reduction in student populations resulted in lower revenue in as campuses within transitional schools wind down their operations  the number of students remaining to complete their studies declines 
as such  revenue within transitional schools will continue to decline 
health education s revenues increased over the prior year due to strong growth in student populations and increased starts 
international s increased revenue over the prior year can be attributed to strong student population growth  million of favorable foreign currency exchange rates and million of additional revenue in related to the acquisition of istituto marangoni at the end of january educational services and facilities expense educational services and facilities expense increased million as compared to the prior year 
during  we took steps to optimize our real estate footprint and as a result  the current year expense includes million of charges related to the termination of a dormitory lease at one of our culinary arts schools and the recording of future minimum lease obligations for space that was vacated within culinary arts  art design and university 
the current year also includes million of severance and stay bonus expense associated with our decision to teach out certain campuses and our efforts to reduce redundancies within our organization

the increase in the accounts receivable balances is due in part to the number of students participating in our extended payment plan programs 
as these students are making smaller in school payments  their respective accounts receivable balances are growing 
goodwill and asset impairment during  we recorded approximately million in asset impairment charges  including million related to the reduction in asset carrying values for certain campuses within culinary arts and transitional schools and million related to the write off of an intangible asset within health education

operating income includes million in lease exit costs  million in severance and stay bonus expense  million of asset impairment charges and million of net expense associated with legal settlements 
operating income includes million in asset impairment charges and million in expenses associated with legal settlements 
provision for income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate for continuing operations was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the decline in our effective income tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a permanent tax benefit on the sale of a foreign entity  a higher percentage of our income from continuing operations resulting from certain operations in europe which operate on a not for profit basis and the reduction of tax reserves due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on international tax matters and the closing of a state income tax audit 
we identify items that are not normal and recurring in nature and treat these as discrete events 
the tax effect of discrete items is booked entirely in the period in which the discrete event occurs 
additionally  tax legislation and tax examinations in the jurisdictions in which we do business may change our effective tax rate in future periods 
while such changes cannot be predicted  if they occur  the impact on our tax assets  obligations and liquidity will need to be measured and recognized in the financial statements 

table of contents loss from discontinued operations the results of operations for brooks college sunnyvale and long beach  ca  iadt toronto  canada  iadt pittsburgh  pa and gibbs college piscataway  nj for all periods presented comprise the loss from discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter  we ceased operations at brooks college long beach  ca  iadt pittsburgh  pa and gibbs piscataway  nj and during the second quarter  we sold iadt toronto  canada and ceased operations at brooks college sunnyvale  ca 
we do not anticipate any further significant costs from any of these campuses 
as other campuses within transitional schools cease operations in the future  we will reclassify their results of operations for all periods presented to discontinued operations 
we anticipate that all but one of the ten remaining schools within transitional schools will cease operations during see note discontinued operations of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our discontinued operations 
year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenue total revenue decreased million  or from the overall decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to year over year declines in university  transitional schools and art design being partially offset by increases in international  health education and culinary arts 
university revenue declined over the prior year due to several factors 
aiu student starts and average student populations declined as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the impact of the commission on colleges of the southern association of colleges and schools sacs probationary status which was not lifted until december in addition  university experienced a shift in population mix that included an increase in ctu students  which has lower revenue per student than aiu  and an increase in students in university s fully online associated degree programs  which offer lower tuition rates than those of the university s fully online bachelor s degree and master s degree programs 
within transitional schools  as campuses wind down their operations  the number of students remaining to complete their studies declines 
as such  revenue within transitional schools continues to decline 
health education s revenues increased over the prior year due to strong growth in student populations and increased starts 
international s increased revenue over the prior year can be attributed to the acquisition of istituto marangoni in january which contributed million of revenue  increased average student population driving a million increase in revenue at our inseec schools and million of favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
educational services and facilities expense the increase in educational services and facilities expense is primarily attributable to million of istituto marangoni costs included in as a result of their acquisition by us in january  increased occupancy costs across most of our segments and increased academic costs primarily within international and culinary arts 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in other student related expenses  including the costs of laptop computers  textbooks  and other program materials  attributable to decreases in student population at certain schools during general and administrative expense the decrease in general and administrative expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in admissions  advertising and bad debt expenses incurred within university and a decrease in administrative and admissions expense in corporate and other  partially offset by increases in culinary arts  health education and international

goodwill and asset impairment during  we recorded approximately million in asset impairment charges related to the reduction in asset carrying values for certain campuses within transitional schools 
during  these campuses were either being held for sale or were in the process of being taught out 
the charges relate to the reduction of the carrying value of long lived assets to their fair value  less cost to sell 
in  we recorded approximately million in goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges related to our health education segment and approximately million in asset impairment charges related to a reduction in asset values of certain campuses with transitional schools and health education 
operating income the decrease in the operating income as compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the decline in university s operating profit 
the decline in university s operating profit was primarily attributable to the negative effects of the sacs probation status for the aiu universities along with increased competition 

table of contents provision for income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate for continuing operations was for the year ended december   as compared to for the comparable prior year period

current year revenue was down slightly compared to the prior year as growth in university s online platforms was offset by declines in the on ground universities 
average revenue per student declined over the prior year primarily due to growth in the student population in the university s fully online associate degree programs  which maintain lower tuition rates than bachelor s degree and master s degree programs 
this decline was partially offset by increases in student population and revenue in ctu s online and on ground platforms 
current year operating income increased by million as compared to the prior year 
operating profit margin improved both within our on ground and online platforms 
the operating income improvement over the prior year is primarily due to a reduction in admissions expense resulting from actions taken to improve productivity within our admissions process 
culinary arts 
current year revenue declined as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in average student population primarily due to the loss of third party student loan financing for certain students 
starts were down as compared to the prior year 
the introduction of our extended payment plans during the second quarter along with the increased title iv funding led to increases in student starts in the fourth quarter of  however  this improvement was not enough to overcome the shortfalls experienced earlier in the year 
culinary arts current year operating loss includes million in lease exit and related asset impairment charges associated with the exit of a dormitory and other facility and a million charge associated with the settlement of certain legal matters 
these charges  in addition to the significant decline in revenue as compared to the prior year and an increase in bad debt expense  led to the decline in operating results in the current year

the prior year operating income includes a million charge related to the settlement of a legal matter and million related to asset impairment charges recorded for the two former gibbs college campuses that were previously held for sale 
art design 
current year revenue declined from the prior year due to a reduction in student starts and related population 
lower student starts related to the elimination of third party student loan financing for certain prospective students and a higher level of attrition in the current year as compared to the prior year account for the decreases 
these impacts are being partially offset by the growth in revenue of the newer campuses  iadt sacramento  ca  iadt san antonio  tx and the fully online campus of iadt 
excluding the positive revenue impact of these three campuses  art design revenue would have been down approximately as compared to the prior year period 
art design s current year operating income declined driven by the lower revenue and increased bad debt expense as compared to the prior year 
more students within art design are utilizing extended payment plans to help fund their education 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts charged against revenue related to these extended payment plans is higher than for other funding sources

current year operating income also includes approximately million related to favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
transitional schools 
current year revenue declined as compared to the prior year due to the schools no longer enrolling students 
we expect revenue to continue to decline as compared to the prior year as the schools continue to wind down their operations

revenue in decreased as compared to primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per student as well as a decline in average population as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in average revenue per student was attributable to a population mix change that included an increase in ctu students  which has a lower revenue per student than aiu  and an increase in students in university s fully online associate degree programs  which offer lower tuition rates than those of university s fully online bachelor s degree and master s degree programs 
the increase in online associate degree seeking students was a result of a pricing reduction in our aiu online associate programs and strong student population growth at ctu online 
the decline in average population was driven by a decline in average population for both aiu online and on ground being partially offset by an increase in the average ctu online population 
we believe that the declines in the aiu student population and student starts were primarily attributable to the continuing effects of the sacs probation status  which was lifted in december the sacs probation status that remained in place during the majority of the academic school year negatively impacted those schools ability to recruit new students 
the effects of the sacs probation status resulted in a decrease in student population and revenue at each of our aiu universities 
the combined revenue for university s fully online platforms  including aiu online and ctu online  decreased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  operating income declined million primarily due to the significant reduction in revenue

table of contents summary of significant accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our schools 
we generally segregate our revenue into two categories  tuition and registration fees and other 
tuition and registration fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our schools 
we generally bill a student for tuition and registration fees at the beginning of an academic term  and we recognize the tuition and registration fees as revenue on a straight line basis over the academic term  which includes any applicable externship period 
the portion of tuition and registration fees payments received from students but not earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet  as such amount represents revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term  we refund the portion of tuition and registration fees already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
our schools academic year is generally at least weeks in length but varies both by school and program of study and is divided by academic terms 
academic terms are determined by start dates  which also vary by school and program 
our schools charge tuition at varying amounts  depending on the school and on the type of program and specific curriculum 
our students finance tuition costs through a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships  and cash payments 
other revenue consists of  among other things  bookstore sales  student laptop computer sales  dormitory revenue  restaurant revenue  contract training revenue  and cafeteria revenue 
revenue from dormitory and cafeteria services is generally billed to a student at the beginning of an academic term and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenue  as well as student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  restaurant revenue  and contract training revenue  is billed and recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
certain of our schools bill students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies 
such billings  which we treat as a single accounting unit  are recognized as tuition and registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable academic term 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our schools for tuition and certain other educational costs 
based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
our allowance estimation methodology considers a number of factors that  based on our collections experience  we believe have an impact on students credit risk and the realizability of our student receivables 
among these factors are a student s status in school or out of school  anticipated funding source for example  federal loan or grant  state grant  private loan  student cash payments  etc  whether or not an out of school student has completed his or her program of study  and our overall collections experience 
out of school students include students who have withdrawn from or completed their programs of study 
all other students are classified as in school students 

table of contents we monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our student receivables  as noted above  or modifications to our credit standards  collection practices  and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables from operations as of december   would have resulted in a change in income from continuing operations of million during the year then ended 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs  or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition  including the realizability of our receivables 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results and cash flows and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
we monitor the operating results and cash flows of our reporting units on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment considerations and related charges we recognized during the year ended december  long lived assets on an ongoing basis  we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the estimated fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived

 accounting for income taxes sfas 
this requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
on january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is an interpretation of sfas fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the initial application of fin to our tax positions had no effect on our stockholders equity

table of contents cash and cash equivalents and investments 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments is primarily attributable to less share repurchases in as compared to as such  higher amounts of operating cash flow were invested in student receivables  net 
our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables and days sales outstanding dso from operations as of and for the twelve months ended december   and were as follows as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables dso in days we calculate dso by dividing net receivables  including both student receivables and other receivables  by annual average daily revenue 
annual average daily revenue is computed by dividing total revenue for the twelve months ended december  by days 
the increase in dso to days as of december  as compared with days as of december  resulted from slightly lower average revenue per day 
allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross student receivables increased as of december  from december  due primarily to the use of extended payment plans which have a higher estimated allowance for bad debt than other sources of funding utilized by our students 
assets of discontinued operations 
the decrease in assets of discontinued operations is primarily attributable to the closure of four campuses and the sale of one campus in payroll and related benefits 
the increase in the payroll and related benefits liabilities is primarily due to the company achieving its annual incentive compensation metrics in deferred tuition revenue 
tuition revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the academic term  which includes any applicable externship period 
the decrease in deferred tuition revenue is primarily due to timing of academic term completions and the mix of programs for which revenue is being earned 
liabilities of discontinued operations 
the decrease in liabilities of discontinued operations is primarily attributable to the closure of four campuses and the sale of one campus in litigation and regulatory matters see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of selected litigation and regulatory matters affecting our business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use various techniques to manage our market risk  including  from time to time  the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
a portion of our municipal bond investments are auction rate securities ars with maturities generally every or days 
ars generally have stated terms to maturity of greater than one year 
however  we classify investments in ars as current on our consolidated balance sheets due to our ability to divest our holdings at auction maturity  which is less than one year 
auctions can fail when the number of sellers of the security exceeds the buyers for that particular auction period 
in the event that an auction fails  the interest rate resets at a rate based on a formula determined by the individual security 
the ars for which auctions have failed continue to accrue interest and are auctioned on a set interval until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as of december   we do not consider the value of our investments in ars to be impaired 
if  however  the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
municipal bonds that are invested in ars were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
interest rate exposure any outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement bear annual interest at variable rates tied to the prime rate and the british bankers association libor rate 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under these agreements 
the outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement as of december  were million 
we estimate that the book value of our investments  debt instruments  and any derivative financial instruments approximated their fair values as of december  and we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates is not significant 
foreign currency exposure we are subject to foreign currency exchange exposures arising from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into us dollar balance sheet accounts 
specifically  we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the value of the euro and the british pound vis vis the us dollar 
our investment in our foreign operations as of december   was not significant to our consolidated financial position  and the book values of the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations as of december   approximated their estimated fair values 
we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not significant
