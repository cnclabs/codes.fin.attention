executive summary significant events in and hurricane ike centerpoint houston s electric delivery system suffered substantial damage as a result of hurricane ike  which struck the upper texas coast early saturday  september  the strong category storm initially left more than of centerpoint houston s more than million metered customers without power  the largest outage in centerpoint houston s year history 
most of the widespread power outages were due to power lines damaged by downed trees and debris blown by hurricane ike s winds 
in addition  on galveston island and along the coastal areas of the gulf of mexico and galveston bay  the storm surge and flooding from rains accompanying the storm caused significant damage or destruction of houses and businesses served by centerpoint houston 
centerpoint houston estimates that total costs to restore the electric delivery facilities damaged as a result of hurricane ike will be in the range of million to million 
as is common with electric utilities serving coastal regions  the poles  towers  wires  street lights and pole mounted equipment that comprise centerpoint houston s transmission and distribution system are not covered by property insurance  but office buildings and warehouses and their contents and substations are covered by insurance that provides for a maximum deductible of million 
current estimates are that total losses to property covered by this insurance were approximately million 
in addition to storm restoration costs  centerpoint houston lost approximately million in revenue through december  within the first days after the storm  centerpoint houston had restored power to all customers capable of receiving it 

table of contents centerpoint houston has deferred the uninsured storm restoration costs as management believes it is probable that such costs will be recovered through the regulatory process 
as a result  storm restoration costs did not affect our or centerpoint houston s reported net income for as of december   centerpoint houston recorded an increase of million in construction work in progress and million in regulatory assets for restoration costs incurred through december  approximately million of these costs are based on estimates and are included in accounts payable as of december  additional restoration costs will continue to be incurred in assuming necessary enabling legislation is enacted by the texas legislature in the session that began in january  centerpoint houston expects to seek a financing order from the texas utility commission to obtain recovery of its storm restoration costs through the issuance of non recourse securitization bonds similar to the storm recovery bonds issued by another texas utility following the hurricanes that affected that utility s service territories in assuming those bonds are issued  centerpoint houston will recover the amount of storm restoration costs determined by the texas utility commission to have been prudently incurred out of the bond proceeds  with the bonds being repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers 
alternatively  if securitization is not available  recovery of those costs would be sought through traditional regulatory mechanisms 
under its rate case settlement  centerpoint houston is entitled to seek an adjustment to rates in this situation  even though in most instances its rates are frozen until gas operations also suffered some damage to its system in houston  texas and in other portions of its service territory across texas and louisiana 
as of december   gas operations has deferred approximately million of costs related to hurricane ike for recovery as part of future natural gas distribution rate proceedings

interstate pipeline expansion the southeast supply header sesh pipeline project  a joint venture between centerpoint energy gas transmission  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp  and spectra energy corp  was placed into commercial service on september  this new mile pipeline  which extends from the perryville hub  near perryville  louisiana  to an interconnection with the gulf stream natural gas system near mobile  alabama  has a maximum design capacity of approximately one bcf per day 
the pipeline represents a new source of natural gas supply for the southeast united states and offers greater supply diversity to this region 
our share of sesh s net construction costs is approximately million 
outlook during  economic conditions in the united states declined significantly  with several large bank failures and consolidations  large declines in the values of securities  disruptions in the capital markets  which made it difficult to raise debt and equity  and increased costs for capital when it was available 
many of the factors that led to the economic decline are continuing into  but it is impossible to predict the impacts such events may have in the future 
although our businesses and the areas in which we serve have  to date  not been as significantly affected as some others  in  we experienced substantial declines in the value of our pension plan assets as a result of the stock market declines 
disruptions in the bank and capital markets during the last two quarters of have led to higher borrowing costs and greater uncertainty regarding the ability to execute transactions in these markets 
although we cannot predict future performance  the decline in the value of our pension plan assets that occurred during will result in increased non cash charges to pension plan expense in  which will adversely impact earnings  and may also result in the need for us to make significant cash contributions to our pension plan subsequent to we also expect to experience higher borrowing costs and greater uncertainty in executing capital markets transactions if conditions in financial markets do not improve from their current state 
to the extent the adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers  results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer 
the current low commodity prices for natural gas and other energy products may cause energy producers to scale back projects such as drilling new gas wells or constructing new facilities 
reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry 
also  adverse economic conditions  coupled with concerns for protecting the environment  may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities  resulting in less demand for our services 

table of contents these factors may lead to reduced earnings during  compared to  if they continue significantly into or if the magnitude of the economic downturn increases beyond the impacts experienced in certain factors affecting future earnings our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations 
the magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors including the resolution of the true up components  including  in particular  the results of appeals to the courts regarding rulings obtained to date  state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments  including deregulation  re regulation  environmental regulations  including regulations related to global climate change  and changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to the various aspects of our business  timely and appropriate legislative and regulatory actions allowing securitization or other recovery of costs associated with hurricane ike  timely and appropriate rate actions and increases  allowing recovery of costs and a reasonable return on investment  cost overruns on major capital projects that cannot be recouped in prices  industrial  commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices  particularly natural gas and natural gas liquids  the timing and extent of changes in the supply of natural gas  the timing and extent of changes in natural gas basis differentials  weather variations and other natural phenomena  changes in interest rates or rates of inflation  commercial bank and financial market conditions  our access to capital  the cost of such capital  and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts  including availability of funds in the debt capital markets  actions by rating agencies  effectiveness of our risk management activities  inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations to us  non payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers  including reliant energy  inc rri  the ability of rri and its subsidiaries to satisfy their other obligations to us  including indemnity obligations  or in connection with the contractual arrangements pursuant to which we are their guarantor  the outcome of litigation brought by or against us  our ability to control costs  the investment performance of our employee benefit plans  our potential business strategies  including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses  which we cannot assure will be completed or will have the anticipated benefits to us

an s p rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term 
a stable outlook from fitch encompasses a one to two year horizon as to the likely ratings direction 
a decline in these credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our billion credit facility  centerpoint houston s million credit facility and cerc corp 
s million credit facility 
a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions 
additionally  a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments 
in september  we issued zens having an original principal amount of billion of which million remain outstanding 
each zens note is exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc common stock tw common attributable to each zens note 
if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid  some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash 
funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common that we own or from other sources 
we own shares of tw common equal to approximately of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes 
zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax liabilities related to the zens notes and tw common shares become current tax obligations when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common shares are sold 
a tax obligation of approximately million would have been payable with respect to the zens for the tax year if all of the zens had been exchanged for cash on december  the ultimate tax obligation related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens notes 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of  enacted on february   allows us to elect to defer this tax obligation until and to recognize it over the period from through for any zens retired in or centerpoint energy services  inc ces  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp 
operating in our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment  provides comprehensive natural gas sales and 
table of contents services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern united states 
in order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices  ces uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry  including those pertaining to credit thresholds 
typically  the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to ces 
to the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to ces at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold  ces is not obligated to provide collateral 
mark to market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by ces 
as of december   the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately million 
should the credit ratings of cerc corp 
as the credit support provider for ces fall below certain levels  ces would be required to provide additional collateral on two business days notice up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit 
we estimate that as of december   unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregate million  however  utilized credit capacity is significantly lower 
in addition  cerc corp 
and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of million based on cerc corp 
s s p senior unsecured long term debt rating of bbb 
upgrades and downgrades from this bbb rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly 
pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper s guarantor drop below a threshold level  which is generally investment grade ratings from both moody s and s p  cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper 
if the credit ratings of cerc corp 
decline below the applicable threshold levels  cerc corp 
might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as million  the amount depending on seasonal variations in transportation levels 
cross defaults 
under our revolving credit facility  a payment default on  or a non payment default that permits acceleration of  any indebtedness exceeding million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default 
in addition  four outstanding series of our senior notes  aggregating million in principal amount as of february   provide that a payment default by us  cerc corp 
or centerpoint houston in respect of  or an acceleration of  borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations  in the aggregate principal amount of million  will cause a default 
a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities 
possible acquisitions  divestitures and joint ventures 
from time to time  we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses 
any determination to take any action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time  and accordingly  the timing  size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances 
debt or equity financing may not  however  be available to us at that time due to a variety of events  including  among others  maintenance of our credit ratings  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions and market perceptions 
other factors that could affect cash requirements 
in addition to the above factors  our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts  including gas purchases  gas price hedging and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments  particularly given gas price levels and volatility  acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances  as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers  increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas  increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities  various regulatory actions

critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
accordingly  these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for rate regulation statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
our electric transmission distribution business segment  our natural gas distribution business segment and portions of our interstate pipelines business segment apply sfas no 
certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is 
table of contents probable  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates 
determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes  but is not limited to  consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings  proposed regulatory decisions  final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals 
if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable  we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities 
at december   we had recorded regulatory assets of billion and regulatory liabilities of million 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis as of july  unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows  interest rates  regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
asset retirement obligations we account for our long lived assets under sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
fin 
sfas no 
and fin require that an asset retirement obligation be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
in the same period  the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
rate regulated entities may recognize regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recognition of costs as recorded in accordance with sfas no 
and fin  and costs recovered through the ratemaking process 
we estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations by calculating the discounted cash flows that are dependent upon the following components inflation adjustment the estimated cash flows are adjusted for inflation estimates for labor  equipment  materials  and other disposal costs  discount rate the estimated cash flows include contingency factors that were used as a proxy for the market risk premium  and third party markup adjustments internal labor costs included in the cash flow calculation were adjusted for costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire the asset 
changes in these factors could materially affect the obligation recorded to reflect the ultimate cost associated with retiring the assets under sfas no 
and fin for example  if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  this would increase the balance for asset retirement obligations by approximately 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate by basis points would decrease asset retirement obligations by approximately the same percentage 
at december   our estimated cost of retiring these assets is approximately million 
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers 
however  the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their 
table of contents meters  which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes  applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
pension and other retirement plans we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded 
please read other significant matters pension plans for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements see note o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 
other significant matters pension plans 
as discussed in note p to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain a non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees 
employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
under the terms of our pension plan  we reserve the right to change  modify or terminate the plan 
our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa 
we made no contribution to the qualified pension plans in and the minimum funding requirements for these plans did not require contributions for the respective years 
additionally  we maintain an unfunded non qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated 
employer contributions for the non qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled million and million in and  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires us  as the sponsor of a plan  to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan s over funded status or as a liability such plan s under funded status  b measure a plan s assets and obligations as of the 
table of contents end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
as of december   we recorded a regulatory asset of million and a charge to accumulated comprehensive income of million  net of tax 
at december   the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by million 
changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during could materially  positively or negatively  change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions 
pension expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
as of december   our qualified pension plan had an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was lower than the rate assumed as of december  we believe that our actual asset allocation  on average  will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of  which is a increase from the discount rate assumed in the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan 
pension expense for  including the benefit restoration plan  is estimated to be million  of which we expect million to impact pre tax earnings  based on an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of as of december  if the expected return assumption were lowered by from to  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
as of december   the pension plan projected benefit obligation exceeded plan assets including the unfunded benefit restoration plan by million 
if the discount rate were lowered by from to  the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and pension expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december  by million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in of million  net of tax 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity prices we are exposed to various market risks 
these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements 
most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks 
categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non trading activities  interest rates and equity prices 
a description of each market risk is set forth below commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and price volatilities of commodities  such as natural gas  natural gas liquids and other energy commodities 

table of contents interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework 
we manage our commodity price risk exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts 
during the normal course of business  we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchange 
derivative transactions are entered into in our non trading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures  such as exposure to changes in natural gas prices 
we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged 
interest rate risk as of december   we had outstanding long term debt  bank loans  lease obligations  and our obligations under our zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
our floating rate obligations aggregated million and billion at december  and  respectively 
if the floating interest rates were to increase by from december  rates  our combined interest expense would increase by approximately million annually 
at december  and  we had outstanding fixed rate debt excluding indexed debt securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively  in principal amount and having a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
because these instruments are fixed rate  they do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the zens obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component 
the debt component of million at december  was a fixed rate obligation and  therefore  did not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from levels at december  changes in the fair value of the derivative component  a million recorded liability at december   are recorded in our statements of consolidated income and  therefore  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk free interest rate 
if the risk free interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  the fair value of the derivative component liability would increase by approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated income 
equity market value risk we are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of million shares of tw common  which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our zens obligation 
a decrease of from the december  market value of tw common would result in a net loss of approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated income 

table of contents commodity price risk from non trading activities we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in our businesses 
the stand alone commodity risk created by these instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge  is described below 
we measure the commodity risk of our non trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis performed on our non trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical movement in energy prices 
at december   the recorded fair value of our non trading energy derivatives was a net liability of million before collateral 
the net liability consisted of a net liability of million associated with price stabilization activities of our natural gas distribution business segment and a net asset of million related to our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment 
net assets or liabilities related to the price stabilization activities correspond directly with net over under recovered gas cost liabilities or assets on the balance sheet 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have increased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives net liability by million with all of the increase attributable to price stabilization activities related to our natural gas distribution business segment 
there would be no consolidated income statement impact of the million as the natural gas distribution segment records the offset to net over under recovered gas cost liabilities or assets on the balance sheet 
the above analysis of the non trading energy derivatives utilized for commodity price risk management purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate 
furthermore  the non trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio  reducing overall risks within limits 
therefore  the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of non trading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above is expected to be substantially offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions
