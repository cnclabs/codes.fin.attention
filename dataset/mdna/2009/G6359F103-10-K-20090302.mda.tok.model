item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and our financial condition 
this information is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
nabors is the largest land drilling contractor in the world 
we conduct oil  gas and geothermal land drilling operations in the us lower states  alaska  canada  south america  mexico  the caribbean  the middle east  the far east  russia and africa 
nabors also is one of the largest land well servicing and workover contractors in the united states and canada and is a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the united states and multiple international markets 
to further supplement and complement our primary business  we offer a wide range of ancillary well site services  including engineering  transportation  construction  maintenance  well logging  directional drilling  rig instrumentation  data collection and other support services  in selected domestic and international markets 
we offer logistics services for onshore drilling in canada using helicopter and fixed winged aircraft 
we manufacture and lease or sell top drives for a broad range of drilling applications  directional drilling systems  rig instrumentation and data collection equipment  pipeline handling equipment and rig reporting software 
we also invest in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities worldwide 
the majority of our business is conducted through our various contract drilling operating segments  which include our drilling  workover and well servicing operations  on land and offshore 
our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations are included in a category labeled oil and gas for segment reporting purposes 
our operating segments engaged in drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations are aggregated in a category labeled other operating segments for segment reporting purposes 
our businesses depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
therefore  a sustained increase or decrease in the price of natural gas or oil  which could have a material impact on exploration  development and production activities  could also materially affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business 
the primary determinate of customer spending is the degree of their cash flow and earnings which are largely determined by natural gas prices in our us lower land drilling and canadian drilling operations  while oil prices are the primary determinate in our alaskan  international  us offshore gulf of mexico  canadian well servicing and us land well servicing operations 
the following table sets forth natural gas and oil price data per bloomberg for the last three years year ended december  increase decrease to to commodity prices average henry hub natural gas spot price million cubic feet mcf average west texas intermediate crude oil spot price barrel beginning in the second half of  there has been a significant decrease in natural gas and oil prices 
natural gas prices  which averaged per mcf during the first half of  declined significantly  averaging only per mcf during the second half of and per mcf during december the decline has continued as natural gas prices have averaged per mcf during the period january  through february  oil prices also declined in the second half of with average prices of per barrel during the first half of  decreasing to average prices of per barrel during the second half of and per barrel during december oil prices remain depressed and have averaged per barrel during the period january  through february  this significant decline in commodity prices has  at least in part  been driven by the significant deterioration of the global economic environment including the extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets 
all of these factors are having an adverse effect on our customers spending plans for exploration  production and development activities which has had a significant negative impact on our operations beginning in december 
table of contents operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or as compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for the year ended december  totaled billion and million per diluted share  respectively  representing decreases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended december  totaled billion  representing an increase of million  or as compared to the year ended december  adjusted income derived from operating activities and net income for the year ended december  totaled billion and million per diluted share  respectively  representing decreases of and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  our operating results were negatively impacted as a result of non cash  pre tax charges arising from oil and gas full cost ceiling test writedowns and goodwill and intangible asset impairments 
our earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates line in our income statement includes million  representing our proportionate share of non cash pre tax full cost ceiling test writedowns from our us  international and canadian joint ventures during the three months ended december  additionally  we recorded non cash pre tax impairment charges of million related to our wholly owned ramshorn business unit under application of the successful efforts method of accounting related to oil and gas properties during the three months ended december  charges from our us  international and canadian joint ventures and our wholly owned ramshorn business unit are included in our oil and gas operating segment results 
our canada well servicing and drilling operating segment and nabors blue sky ltd  one of our canadian subsidiaries reported in our other operating segments include million and million non cash pre tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value due to the duration of the economic downturn in canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery 
excluding these charges  our operating results were slightly higher primarily due to our us lower land drilling  international drilling and other operating segments resulting from higher average dayrates and activity levels resulting from sustained higher natural gas and oil prices throughout and the majority of  partially offset by increased operating costs and higher depreciation expense due to our capital expenditures 
the decrease in our adjusted income derived from operating activities from to related primarily to our us lower land drilling  canada drilling and well servicing  and our us well servicing operations  where activity levels decreased despite slightly higher natural gas prices and higher oil prices 
operating results were further negatively impacted by higher levels of depreciation expense due to our capital expenditures 
partially offsetting the decreases in our adjusted income derived from operating activities were the increases in operating results from our international operations and to a lesser extent by our alaska operations  driven by high oil prices 
in addition  our net income and earnings per share for has decreased compared to as a result of investment net losses during only partially offset by a lower effective tax rate and a lower number of average shares outstanding 
our operating results for are expected to decrease from levels realized during given our current expectation of the continuation of lower commodity prices during and the related impact on drilling and well servicing activity and dayrates 
the decrease in drilling activity and dayrates is expected to have a significant impact on our us lower land drilling and our us land well servicing operations 
in our us lower land drilling operations  our rig count has decreased from its peak during october of rigs to rigs currently operating as of february  our well servicing activity is down approximately from its october peak of  hours when compared to estimated rig hours for february we expect our international operations to increase during resulting from the deployment of additional rigs under long term contracts and the renewal of existing contracts at higher dayrates

represents the elimination of inter segment transactions 
adjusted income derived from operating activities is computed by subtracting direct costs  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense from operating revenues and then adding earnings from unconsolidated affiliates 
such amounts should not be used as a substitute to those amounts reported under gaap 
however  management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria  including adjusted income derived from operating activities  because it believes that this financial measure is an accurate reflection of the ongoing profitability of our company 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to income from continuing operations before income taxes  which is a gaap measure  is provided within the above table

segment results of operations contract drilling our contract drilling operating segments contain one or more of the following operations drilling  workover and well servicing  on land and offshore 
us lower land drilling 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease and rig activity to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years 
table of contents the increase in operating results from to was due to overall year over year increases in rig activity and increases in average dayrates  driven by higher natural gas prices throughout and most of this increase was only partially offset by higher operating costs and an increase in depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects 
the decrease in operating results from to was a result of year over year decreases in drilling activity 
additionally  the decrease in operating results was due to higher drilling rig operating costs  including depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects

the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease and rig activity to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig hours operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased from to and from to primarily as a result of higher average dayrates year over year  driven by high oil prices during and the majority of as well as market expansion 
higher average dayrates were partially offset by lower rig utilization 
adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased from to and from to despite higher revenues due primarily to higher depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects and  to a lesser extent  higher operating costs 
us offshore 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease and rig activity to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years the increase in operating results from to primarily resulted from higher average dayrates and increased drilling activity driven by high oil prices during the majority of  especially in the sundowner and super sundowner platform workover and re drilling rigs and the mase platform drilling rigs 
the increase in was partially offset by higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense relating to new rigs added to the fleet in early the decrease in operating results from to primarily resulted from a decrease in average dayrates and utilization for our jack up rigs  partially offset by the deployment of two new built barge and one platform workover drilling rigs in early operating results were further negatively impacted by increased depreciation expense relating to the new rigs added to the fleet 
alaska 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase and rig activity to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years the increase in operating results from to and from to is primarily due to year over year increases in average dayrates and drilling activity 
drilling activity levels have increased as a result of year over year increased customer demand  driven by higher oil prices throughout and most of  and the deployment and utilization of additional rigs added in late these increases have been partially offset by higher operating costs and increased depreciation expense as well as increased labor and repairs and maintenance costs in and as compared to prior years 
canada 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows 
table of contents in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease and rig activity to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years drilling rig hours well servicing the decrease in operating results from to and from to resulted from year over year decreases in drilling and well servicing activity and decreases in average dayrates for drilling and well servicing operations as a result of economic uncertainty and alberta s tight labor market resulting in a number of projects being delayed 
our operating results were further negatively impacted by proposed changes to the alberta royalty and tax regime causing customers to assess the impact of such changes 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar during and throughout the majority of positively impacted operating results  but negatively impacted demand for our services as much of our customers revenue is denominated in us dollars while their costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
additionally  operating results were negatively impacted by increased operating expenses  including depreciation expense related to capital expansion projects 
operating results exclude non cash pre tax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges that are separately reflected in the goodwill and intangible asset impairment financial line in our consolidated statements of income 
international 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase and rig activity to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years the increase in operating results from to and from to primarily resulted from year over year increases in average dayrates and drilling activities  reflecting strong customer demand for drilling services  stemming from sustained higher oil prices throughout and most of the increases in operating results during and were also positively impacted by an expansion of our rig fleet and continuing renewal of existing multi year contracts at higher average dayrates 
these increases are partially offset by increased operating expenses  including depreciation expense related to capital expenditures for new and refurbished rigs deployed throughout and oil and gas this operating segment represents our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations 
the results of operations for this reportable segment are as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities  n m the percentage is so large that it is not meaningful 
operating results decreased from to as a result of non cash pre tax impairment charges recorded during the fourth quarter of by our wholly owned ramshorn business unit and our us  international and canadian joint ventures 
because of the low natural gas prices at year end  we performed an impairment test on our oil and gas properties of our wholly owned ramshorn business unit which follows the successful efforts method of accounting 
as a result  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment to oil and gas properties which totaled million 
our joint ventures non cash pre tax full cost ceiling test writedowns  of which our proportionate share totaled million  resulted from the application of the full cost method of accounting for costs related to oil and natural gas properties 
the full cost ceiling test limits the carrying value of the capitalized cost of the properties to the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and natural gas reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
the full cost ceiling test is evaluated at the end of each quarter using quarter end prices of oil and natural gas  adjusted for the impact of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges 
our us  international and canadian joint 
table of contents ventures used a quarter end price of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for oil which resulted in the ceiling test writedowns 
additionally  our proportionate share of losses from our oil and gas joint ventures included million of depletion charges from lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells and million of mark to market unrealized losses from derivative instruments representing forward gas sales through swaps and price floor guarantees utilizing puts 
beginning in may our us joint venture began to apply hedge accounting to their forward contracts to minimize the volatility in reported earnings caused by market price fluctuations of the underlying hedged commodities 
while our wholly owned ramshorn business unit recorded approximately million in non cash pre tax impairment charges to oil and gas properties  the charge was partially offset by income from our production volumes and oil and gas production sales as a result of higher oil and natural gas prices throughout most of and a million gain on the sale of certain leasehold interests in the increase in our operating results from to was primarily a result of year over year increases in income attributable to earnings related to production payment contracts and gains totaling million recognized on the sale of certain properties during additionally  operating results were higher year over year due to increases in production and increases in oil  gas and natural gas liquid prices 
these increases to operating results were partially offset by a million increase in depletion expense and approximately million in net losses from our joint ventures which commenced operations in  as well as higher seismic costs and workover expenses compared to the prior year 
the higher depletion expense resulted from increased units of production depletion and impairment charges  related to higher costs and lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells 
other operating segments these operations include our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  rig instrumentation and software  and construction and logistics operations 
the results of operations for these operating segments are as follows year ended december  increase in thousands  except percentages to to operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income loss derived from operating activities the increase in operating results from to and from to primarily resulted from year over year increased third party sales and higher margins on top drives driven by the strengthening of the oil drilling market and increased equipment sales and increased market share in canada and increased demand in the us directional drilling market 
results for construction and logistics services increased from to due to increases in customer demand for our construction and logistics services in alaska but decreased from to due to lower demand for our services 
discontinued operations during the third quarter of we sold our sea mar business which had previously been included in other operating segments to an unrelated third party 
the assets included offshore supply vessels and certain related assets  including a right under a vessel construction contract 
the operating results of this business for all periods presented are retroactively presented and accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying audited consolidated statements of income 
our condensed statements of income from discontinued operations related to the sea mar business for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to revenues income from discontinued operations  net of tax the decrease in revenues from to resulted from seven months of operations before our sale of the sea mar business in august the increase in income  net of tax  from to resulted from the gain recognized on the sale 

table of contents other financial information general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of operating revenues general and administrative expenses increased from to and from to primarily as a result of increases in wages and burden for a majority of our operating segments compared to each prior year period  which resulted from an increase in the number of employees required to support the increase in activity levels and from higher wages  and increased corporate compensation expense  which primarily resulted from higher bonuses and non cash compensation expenses recorded for restricted stock awards during each sequential year 
during the fourth quarter of a non recurring non cash charge representing additional compensation expense of million was recorded relating to the company s review of its employee stock option granting practices 
depreciation and amortization  and depletion expense year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to depreciation and amortization expense depletion expense depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from to and from to as a result of capital expenditures made throughout  and relating to our expanded capital expenditure program that commenced in early depletion expense 
the decrease in depletion expense from to primarily resulted from a decrease of non cash impairment charges of million during compared to million during depletion expense increased from to as a result of increased units of production depletion and impairment charges resulting from higher costs and lower than expected performance of certain oil and gas developmental wells 
interest expense year ended december  increase in thousands  except percentages to to interest expense interest expense increased from to as a result of the additional interest expense related to our february and july issuances of senior notes due february in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
interest expense increased from to as a result of the additional interest expense related to the may issuance of the billion senior exchangeable notes due this increase was partially offset by interest expense reductions resulting from the redemption of or million of our zero coupon convertible senior debentures due on february  these zero coupon notes accreted at a rate of per annum 
investment income loss year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages to to investment income loss investment income during was million compared to a net loss of million during the prior year

these losses were partially offset by a million pre tax gain recognized on our purchase of million par value of our billion senior exchangeable notes due the amount of gains losses on sales  retirements and impairments of long lived assets and other income expense  net for represents a net loss of million and includes losses on retirements and impairment charges on long lived assets of approximately million and losses resulting from increases to litigation reserves of million 
these losses were partially offset by the million gain on the sale of three accommodation jack up rigs in the second quarter of goodwill and intangible asset impairment year ended december  in thousands  except percentages goodwill and intangible asset impairment our goodwill impairment for the year ended december  is comprised of million and million  respectively  relating to our canada well servicing and drilling operating segment and nabors blue sky ltd  one of our canadian subsidiaries reported in our other operating segments 
the non cash impairment charges were determined necessary due to the duration of the economic downturn in canada and the lack of certainty regarding eventual recovery in valuing these operations 
additionally  we recorded a non cash impairment to intangible assets of million which related to certain rights and licenses for a helicopter by blue sky  ltd 
a prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices and its potential impact on our financial results could result in future goodwill impairment charges
