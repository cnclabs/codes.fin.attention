risk factors 
general overview the company was organized under the laws of the state of texas in february through our subsidiaries  we operate and franchise mexican theme restaurants featuring various elements associated with the casual dining experience under the names casa ol  monterey s tex mex caf  monterey s little mexico  tortuga coastal cantina  crazy jose s and la se orita 
we also operate fast casual burrito restaurants under the name mission burrito 
at december  we operated restaurants  franchised restaurants and licensed one restaurant in various communities in texas  louisiana  oklahoma and michigan 
our primary source of revenues is the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also derive revenues from franchise fees  royalties and other franchise related activities 
franchise fee revenue from an individual franchise sale is recognized when all services relating to the sale have been performed and the restaurant has commenced operation 
initial franchise fees relating to area franchise sales are recognized ratably in proportion to services that are required to be performed pursuant to the area franchise or development agreements and proportionately as the restaurants within the area are opened 
the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for fiscal years and have been adjusted to remove the operations of closed restaurants  which have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
there were no discontinued operations in fiscal year we have a week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest december references in this report to fiscal  and relate to the periods ended december   december   and december   respectively 
fiscal years  and  presented herein consisted of weeks 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year as adjusted for discontinued operations revenues 
our revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were down  or to million compared with fiscal year restaurant sales for fiscal year decreased  or to million compared with fiscal year we lost approximately million in restaurant sales from the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike 
restaurant sales were also impacted by approximately  due to restaurant fires at two stores 
the decrease also reflects the sale of the stafford  texas casa ol restaurant in july of an increase in same store sales partially offset the above mentioned decreases  along with the addition of four mission burrito fast casual restaurants 
for the week period ended december   excluding the lost sales from the hurricanes and fires from the same store sales comparison only stores open in both periods are included in same store sales amounts  company owned same restaurant sales increased approximately 
the same store sales trend prior to the two hurricanes was up 
franchised owned same restaurant sales  as reported by franchisees  and reflecting the lost hurricane sales  increased approximately over the same week period ended december  franchise fees  royalties and other for the fiscal year ended december  was down  or to  compared with fiscal year because other miscellaneous revenues of a nonrecurring nature were realized in fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded  of business interruption proceeds related to claims for two restaurant fires and hurricane ike store closures 
costs and expenses 
costs of sales  consisting of food  beverage  liquor  supplies and paper costs  increased basis points as a percent of restaurant sales to compared with in fiscal year the increase primarily reflects higher commodity prices  especially cheese  produce  tortillas  supplies and paper costs  and higher food discounts to customers 
in march and again in september of  we raised menu prices at most of the concepts in an effort to offset some of the rise in commodity costs 
labor and other related expenses increased as a percentage of restaurant sales basis points to compared with for fiscal year higher group health insurance expense impacted restaurant labor basis points 
hourly back of house labor and management costs increased basis points  primarily due to lost sales from hurricanes gustav and ike  while hourly front of house labor improved basis points during fiscal year restaurant operating expenses  which primarily includes rent  property taxes  utilities  repair and maintenance  liquor taxes  property insurance  general liability insurance and advertising  increased in fiscal year as a percentage of restaurant sales basis points to as compared with in fiscal year the increase primarily reflects a lower level of sales due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
electricity and natural gas costs also increased 
favorable electricity contracts on approximately of our restaurants expired in august of  resulting in higher electric costs per kilowatt hour thereafter 
we have signed short term  three month contracts until such time management believes that a lower  longer term contract can be obtained 
the price of electricity in texas is primarily tied to the price of natural gas  which has been on a downward trend over the last three months 
these increases were partially offset by lower advertising expense  as we pulled commercial advertising immediately after hurricane ike and during the presidential campaign season 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support restaurant operations 
general and administrative expenses increased basis points as a percentage of total sales to compared with for fiscal year the increase  as a percentage of total revenue  reflects  in part  a lower level of sales due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
actual general and administrative expenses increased  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the increase primarily reflects higher relocation expense  banking fees  legal expenses  consulting fees related to marketing for mission burrito concept development  and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance  all of which were partially offset by reductions in general and administrative salaries and bonuses  and lower manager in training expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percentage of total revenues basis points to in fiscal year as compared with in fiscal year actual depreciation and amortization expense increased  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the increase reflects additional depreciation expense for remodeled restaurants  new restaurants  and the replacement of equipment and leasehold improvements in various existing restaurants 
during fiscal year  we incurred  in pre opening expenses related to the opening of four new mission burrito restaurants 
in fiscal year  we spent  in pre opening expenses related to the re opening of remodeled restaurants 
goodwill impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
at year end  management determined that the fair value did not exceed the carrying amount of the reporting unit and recorded an impairment of approximately million 
impairment and restaurant closure costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairments or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during fiscal year  we expensed  to impair the assets of one closed restaurant  one under performing restaurant earmarked for closure once its lease expires in fiscal year and two other under performing restaurants  and for broker commissions related to two subleased restaurant sites in idaho 
during fiscal year  we expensed  to impair the assets of two under performing restaurants 
gain on involuntary disposals the consolidated statements of operations for the period ended december  includes a separate line item for gain on involuntary disposals which includes a gain of  resulting primarily from the write off of assets damaged by two restaurant fires  offset by insurance proceeds for the replacement of assets 
the first fire occurred on february  at our casa ol restaurant located in vidor  texas which re opened july  the second fire occurred july  at our casa ol restaurant located in pasadena  texas which re opened october  the gain on involuntary disposals was partially offset by losses from hurricanes gustav and ike 
we recorded net losses of  resulting primarily from spoiled inventory caused by temporary electricity outages at company owned restaurants after hurricane ike made landfall on september  during fiscal year  our insurers have paid  and we have recorded a receivable of  related to property damage 
we have spent  as of december  for the replacement of assets related to the two fires and the two hurricanes 
the consolidated statements of operations for period ended december  includes a separate line item for revenues for business interruption insurance proceeds as follows  related to the two restaurant fires and  related to the hurricanes 
loss on sale of other property and equipment 
during fiscal year ended december   we recorded losses of  primarily related to the disposal of restaurant assets during the conversion of an existing restaurant into a mission burrito restaurant 
other income expense 
net expense decreased  to  in fiscal year compared with a net expense of  in fiscal year interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal year compared with interest expense of  in fiscal year  reflecting a decrease in interest rates 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal year was a benefit of as compared to of expense for fiscal year in fiscal year  we had a pretax net loss from continuing operations compared to pretax net income in fiscal year we recorded a receivable of approximately  in for an expected income tax refund for carrying back the net operating loss to an amended income tax return 
the permanent differences in were approximately million higher as compared to the permanent differences in because of the goodwill impairment 
since the tax deduction for goodwill is limited to its net tax value  the difference between the net tax value and net book value contributed to the decrease in the effective tax rate 
certain other permanent differences result in tax credits 
in fiscal year  we were not able to use any of our current year tax credits  but tax credits of  can be carried forward for a twenty year period to reduce future federal regular income taxes 
discontinued operations 
during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded closure income of  all of which is included in discontinued operations 
the closure income related to the revision by management of the estimated repair and maintenance costs  utility costs and property taxes associated with restaurants closed in prior years and actual repairs performed in third quarter no stores were permanently closed in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year as adjusted for discontinued operations revenues 
our revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were up  or to million compared with fiscal year restaurant sales for fiscal year increased  or to million compared with fiscal year the increase in restaurant sales reflects the full year impact of one restaurant opened in fiscal year and the acquisition of mission burrito two restaurants  offset in part by a decline in same restaurant sales 
franchise fees  royalties and other for the fiscal year ended december  was down  or to  compared with fiscal year fiscal year included the recognition of  in royalties due to a correction of understated royalty income over the previous quarters 
for the fiscal year  franchised owned same store sales  as reported by franchisees  increased approximately in fiscal year  we recorded  of business interruption proceeds related to our hurricane rita insurance claim 
costs and expenses 
costs of sales  consisting of food  beverage  liquor  supplies and paper costs  increased basis points as a percent of restaurant sales to compared with in fiscal year the increase primarily reflects higher commodity prices  especially produce  cheese and dry goods 
the increase also reflects a one time adjustment of  to cost of sales to correct for rebates we mistakenly recorded as our own that should have been paid to franchisees 
labor and other related expenses increased as a percentage of restaurant sales basis points to compared with for fiscal year the increase primarily reflects the lingering impact of the first quarter of fiscal year  which had labor cost of  reflecting hourly labor that wasn t scheduled in proportion to declining same restaurant sales 
since the first quarter of  labor cost improved to in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
since the first quarter  labor utilization improvements were approximately the same for all three quarters 
the second quarter benefited from a one time adjustment to worker s compensation insurance and unemployment tax adjustments related to a policy audit and a refund due to excess funding from the state of texas workforce commission 
restaurant operating expenses  which primarily includes rent  property taxes  utilities  repair and maintenance  liquor taxes  property insurance  general liability insurance and advertising  increased in fiscal year as a percentage of restaurant sales basis points to as compared with in fiscal year the increase primarily reflects higher property and casualty insurance expense  which is directly attributable to severe weather associated with the united states gulf coast region  higher repair and maintenance expense  rents and advertising 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support restaurant operations 
general and administrative expenses decreased basis points as a percentage of total sales to compared with for fiscal year actual general and administrative expenses decreased  the decrease primarily reflects lower vested option expense which was partially offset by higher legal expenses  employee finder fees and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley required internal control documentation and testing 
depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percentage of total revenues basis points to in fiscal year as compared with in fiscal year actual depreciation and amortization expense increased  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the increase reflects additional depreciation expense for remodeled restaurants  new restaurants  and the replacement of equipment and leasehold improvements in various existing restaurants 
during fiscal year  we incurred  in pre opening expenses related to the reopening of a remodeled restaurant 
in fiscal year  we spent  in pre opening expenses related to the opening of two new restaurants 
impairment costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairments or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
during fiscal year  we expensed  to impair the assets of two under performing restaurants 
during fiscal year  we expensed  to impair the assets of two under performing restaurants 
we also expensed real estate broker commissions related to the sale of one subleased restaurant and for future broker commissions related to two other subleased restaurants 
gain on disposal of assets hurricane rita 
on september   hurricane rita hit the gulf coast area  affecting a number of our restaurants in that region 
we subsequently hired an insurance consulting firm to assist management with the filing of our insurance claim 
during the second quarter of  we finalized negotiations with our insurance carrier for the hurricane insurance claim 
also  during fiscal year  we capitalized  in asset cost expenditures related to damaged property in the consolidated balance sheets  and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations  as a gain and  as business interruption revenue from the insurance claim 
as of december   we have collected all receivables related to our hurricane insurance claim 
loss on sale of other property and equipment 
during fiscal year  we recorded a loss on the sale of assets of  reflecting the loss from two remodeled restaurants and from the sale of one under performing restaurant to mr 
forehand  vice chairman of the company  who purchased the assets of our casa ol restaurant located in stafford  texas for an agreed price of  shares of our common stock 
the stock was valued at per share  which was the ten day weighted average stock price as of june   for a total value of  the stafford restaurant operates under our uniform franchise agreement and is subject to a monthly royalty fee 
during fiscal year  we recorded a loss of  due to the disposition of miscellaneous assets 
other expense 
net expense increased  to  in fiscal year compared with a net expense of  in fiscal year interest expense increased  to  in fiscal year compared with interest expense of  in fiscal year  reflecting an increase in outstanding debt 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal year was as compared to for fiscal year in fiscal year  we had significantly lower pretax income from continuing operations compared to fiscal year in both years  the permanent differences were approximately the same  resulting in the lower effective tax rate in fiscal year certain permanent differences result in tax credits 
in fiscal year  we were not able to use all of our current year tax credits  but tax credits of  can be carried forward for an indefinite period to reduce future federal regular income taxes 
discontinued operations 
in fiscal year  we closed one under performing restaurant in february  after its lease expired incurring losses from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in fiscal year  we closed four underperforming restaurants incurring losses from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of  the circumstances and testing leading to an impairment charge were determined in accordance with sfas no 
which requires that property and equipment be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  footnotes description of business and summary of significant accounting policies and related party transactions 
liquidity and capital resources we financed our capital expenditure requirements for the fiscal year ended december  primarily by drawing on our revolving line of credit and drawing on our cash reserves 
in fiscal year  we had cash flow provided by operating activities of approximately million  compared with cash flow provided by operating activities of approximately million in fiscal year and cash flow provided by operating activities of approximately million in fiscal year the decrease in cash flows from operating activities reflects the decrease in operating income  primarily due to the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike during the third quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we made a net draw of million on our line of credit  million of which related directly to the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike 
during fiscal year  financing activities provided million  in which million was drawn from our lines of credit with million used for the july purchase of  shares of our common stock and million used for the prepayment of the beaumont based franchise restaurant seller note 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of  compared with a working capital deficit of  at december  and million at december  a working capital deficit is common in the restaurant industry  since restaurant companies do not typically require a significant investment in either accounts receivable or inventory 
our principal capital requirements are the funding of routine capital expenditures  new restaurant development or acquisitions and remodeling of older units 
during fiscal year  total cash used for capital requirements was approximately million  which included approximately million spent for routine capital expenditures  approximately million for new restaurant development  approximately million spent to reconstruct two restaurants damaged by fires  approximately million to reconstruct from hurricane damage  and approximately million spent on remodels 
we opened four mission burrito restaurants during fiscal year  for a total of six mission burrito restaurants 
we closed one mission burrito restaurant on january  after seven months of operations 
we attribute the closure to a poor real estate location 
we expect to begin construction on our seventh mission burrito restaurant in the second quarter of fiscal year due to the recent economic downturn and the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike  we do not expect to enter into any further lease obligations to develop mission burrito restaurants for fiscal year we plan to resume our development of mission burrito in fiscal year and beyond 
in june  the company entered into a credit agreement the wells fargo agreement with wells fargo bank  na wells fargo in order to increase the revolving loan amount available to us from million under our then existing credit facility with bank of america to million 
in connection with the execution of the wells fargo agreement  we prepaid and terminated our then existing credit facility with bank of america 
the wells fargo agreement provides for a revolving loan of up to million  with an option to increase the revolving loan by an additional million  for a total of million 
the wells fargo agreement terminates on june  at our option  the revolving loan bears an interest rate equal to the wells fargo base rate plus a stipulated percentage or libor plus a stipulated percentage 
accordingly  the company is impacted by changes in the base rate and libor 
we are subject to a non use fee of on the unused portion of the revolver from the date of the wells fargo agreement 
the wells fargo agreement also allows up to million in annual stock repurchases 
we have pledged the stock of our subsidiaries  our leasehold interests  our patents and trademarks and our furniture  fixtures and equipment as collateral for our credit facility with wells fargo 
as of december   total debt outstanding under the wells fargo agreement was million 
under the wells fargo agreement  we are required to maintain certain minimum ebitda levels  leverage ratios and fixed charge coverage ratios 
due to the impact of hurricanes gustav and ike in the third quarter of fiscal year  which resulted in approximately million in lost sales  we increased our debt by million to million 
as a result of the lost sales  we failed to satisfy our minimum ebitda covenant under the wells fargo agreement for the twelve month period as of the third quarter of fiscal year we requested and received from wells fargo a waiver to this covenant 
we received an amendment to the agreement effective as of december   eliminating the minimum ebitda requirement and adding limits on our growth capital expenditures 
although the wells fargo agreement permits us to implement a share repurchase program under certain conditions  we currently have no repurchase program in effect 
shares previously acquired are being held for general corporate purposes  including the offset of the dilutive effect on shareholders from the exercise of stock options 
our management believes that with our operating cash flow and our revolving line of credit under the wells fargo agreement  funds will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and to finance routine capital expenditures and new restaurant growth through the next months 
unless we violate a debt covenant  our credit facility with wells fargo  as amended  is not subject to triggering events that would cause the credit facility to become due sooner than the maturity dates described in the previous paragraphs 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations and funds anticipated to be available from our credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short term and long term basis 
changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  failure to maintain financial covenants under our credit facility  financial and non financial covenant requirements or other events may cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes our total contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of december   including leases in excess of one year signed that are effective in payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt principal only operating leases total contractual cash obligations the contractual obligation table does not include interest payments on our long term debt with wells fargo bank due to the variable interest rates under our credit facility and the varying debt balance during the year 
the contractual interest rate for our credit facility is either the prime rate or libor base rate plus a stipulated margin 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  footnote long term debt for balances and terms of our credit facility at december  related parties 
we provide accounting and administrative services for the casa ol media and production funds 
the casa ol media and production funds are not for profit  unconsolidated entities used to collect money from company owned and franchise owned restaurants to pay for the marketing of casa ol restaurants 
each restaurant contributes an agreed upon percentage of sales to the funds 
critical accounting policies 
our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and we select useful lives that reflect the actual economic lives of the underlying assets 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for consolidated financial statement purposes 
we capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
we are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
we periodically perform asset impairment analysis of property and equipment related to our restaurant locations 
we perform these tests when we experience a triggering event such as a major change in a location s operating environment  or other event that might impact our ability to recover our asset investment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
also  we have a policy of reviewing the financial operations of our restaurant locations on at least a quarterly basis 
locations that do not meet expectations are identified and monitored closely throughout the year 
primarily in the fourth quarter  we review actual results and analyze budgets for the ensuing year 
if we deem that a location s results will continue to be below expectations  we will evaluate alternatives for its continued operation 
at that time  we will perform an asset impairment test 
if we determine that the asset s carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we will record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
upon an event such as a formal decision for abandonment restaurant closure  we may record additional impairment charges 
any carryover basis of assets will be depreciated over the respective remaining useful lives 
goodwill 
goodwill and other indefinite lived assets resulted from our acquisition of franchisee owned and third party owned restaurants 
our most significant acquisitions were completed in   and goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization 
however  such assets must be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least annually 
we completed the most recent impairment test as of december  and determined that there were impairment losses related to goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the estimated future cash flows were projected using significant assumptions  including future revenues and expenses 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets 
leasing activities 
we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the minimum future lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period which begins on the possession date and ends on the store opening date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expense during the rent holiday period 
we record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
the contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provisions 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets that are deemed more likely than not to be realized in the near term 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we establish valuation allowances to offset any deferred tax asset recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate  tax planning strategies  and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may be unable to implement certain tax planning strategies or adjust these estimates in future periods 
as we update our estimates  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial position  or we could reduce our valuation allowances  which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations or financial position 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation number  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is intended to clarify the accounting for income taxes prescribing a minimum recognition threshold for a tax position before being recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in accordance with the requirements of fin  we evaluated all tax years still subject to potential audit under state and federal income tax law in reaching our accounting conclusions 
as a result  we concluded we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or any additional tax liabilities after applying fin as of the january  adoption date or for the fiscal year ended december  the adoption of fin therefore had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior 
the use of an option pricing model also requires the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected term 
expected volatility is based on our historical volatility 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
we are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms 
the recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation reserve on deferred tax assets 
we believe the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations 
impact of recently issued standards 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active this fsp clarifies the application of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  when the market for a financial asset is inactive 
specifically  fsp clarifies how management s internal assumptions should be considered in measuring fair value when observable data are not present  observable market information from an inactive market should be taken into account  and the use of broker quotes or pricing services should be considered in assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data to measure fair value 
fsp shall be effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
the implementation of fsp is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated statement of financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fasb fsp emerging issues task force eitf no 
 determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
under the fsp  unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends whether paid or unpaid are participating securities  and should be included in the two class method of computing eps 
the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years  and is not expected to have a material impact on our earnings per share 
in may  the fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas no 
identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
this statement became effective on november  which was days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in september we believe sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this change is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r and other gaap 
the requirement for determining the useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe fsp fas will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas business combinations 
sfas no 
r significantly changes the accounting for business combinations 
under this statement  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
additionally  sfas no

establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement

such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date
