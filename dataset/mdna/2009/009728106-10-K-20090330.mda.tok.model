item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies for more information 
the percentages of gross sales  revenue and gross trade receivables attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors as of and for the years ended december  and december  were as follows gross net gross accounts gross net gross accounts sales revenue receivable sales revenue receivable amerisourcebergen cardinal mckesson amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson are distributors of our products as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
none of these distributors is an end user of our products 
if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease  we believe that the end users of our products would find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor 
however  the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of these wholesalers 
a change in purchasing patterns  a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a risk factors we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect for more information 
backorders 
as of december   we had approximately  of products on backorder as compared to approximately  of backorders as of december  we anticipate filling all current open backorders during government regulation 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies  including the fda  the drug enforcement administration dea  the federal trade commission ftc and other federal  state and local agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  the controlled substance act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market 
the fda inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  non compliance with which can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal to approve ndas and andas and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products 
fda approval is required before any drug can be manufactured and marketed 
new drugs require the filing of an nda  including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug 
generic drugs  which are equivalents of existing  off patent brand name drugs  require the filing of an anda 
an anda does not  for the most part  require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator 
however  the anda must provide data demonstrating the equivalency of 
table of contents the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability 
the time required by the fda to review and approve ndas and andas is variable and  to a large extent  beyond our control 
fda warning letter 
on march   we received an fda warning letter the warning letter following a routine inspection of our decatur  illinois manufacturing facility conducted from september through september  the warning letter alleged violations of the current cgmp regulations 
we responded to the warning letter on april  providing clarifying information and describing corrective actions planned and or completed 
the warning letter had no impact on fda approved products manufactured or distributed by our decatur facility 
the fda conducted another inspection of the decatur facility from july  to august  the fda investigators identified a number of observations representing potential violations of the cgmp regulations 
we submitted comprehensive responses to these observations on september  subsequently  we were notified by the fda on december   that all cgmp issues had been satisfactorily resolved resulting in removal of the warning letter s potential restrictions on new product approvals  approval of the lyophilization and filling operations of the decatur facility  and approval of the site transfer for manufacture of ic green to the decatur facility 
since then  we have received fda approval of several andas and ndas for manufacture of product at the decatur facility 
product recalls 
we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during  due to the third quarter recall notification by becton  dickinson and company bd  of their ml syringe 
this syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug components manufactured and sourced by us  to support the cyanide antidote kit 
our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was necessitated by the bd recall  and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace 
we recorded a  additional provision to sales returns in to recognize the impact of this recall 
our supporting efforts were reviewed by the fda  as part of our due diligence in apprising the agency of our reaction to the bd recall 
there were no product recalls during or dea regulation 
we also manufacture and distribute several controlled drug substances  the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the dea 
failure to comply with dea regulations can result in fines or seizure of product 
environment 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
foreign sales 
during  and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues were from customers located in foreign countries 
seasonality 
most of our business segments do not experience significant seasonality other than td vaccines in the spring through fall seasons and flu vaccine products which are typically sold in the august through november period 
government contracts 
none of our business segments are generally subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

risk factors 
we have experienced recent operating losses  working capital deficiencies and negative cash flows from operations  and these losses and deficiencies may continue in the future 

table of contents our recent operating losses may continue in the future and there can be no assurance that our financial outlook will improve 
for the years ended december   and  our operating losses were   and  respectively 
we generated a positive cash flow from operations in of  however  we generated negative cash flows of  and  in and  respectively 
if our results of operations do not improve we would have to implement a restructuring plan in order to preserve our cash flow and continue business operations 
there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a result of our lack of liquidity  limited capital resources  continued losses and accumulated debt  we have concluded that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  and our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their report on our december  consolidated financial statements which is included in this annual report on form k  an explanatory paragraph describing the events that have given rise to this uncertainty 
these factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional funding to meet our obligations 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate or obtain sufficient cash to meet our obligations on a timely basis 
our losses since have totaled  based on our operating plan  our existing working capital is not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund our planned operating expenses  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements through december  without additional sources of cash and or the deferral  reduction or elimination of significant planned expenditures 
currently  we have no commitments to obtain additional capital  and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
see also risks relating to our credit agreement and inadequate liquidity could materially adversely affect our business operations in the future 
risks relating to our credit agreement our lender has restricted our ability to draw on our credit agreement 
we are party to a credit agreement ge credit agreement with general electric capital corporation ge capital  as agent for the several financial institutions from time to time party to the credit agreement and for itself as a lender  and ge capital markets  inc pursuant to the ge credit agreement  among other things  the lenders agreed to extend loans to us under a revolving credit facility including a letter of credit subfacility up to an aggregate principal amount of  or whatever lower figure is supported by the collateral borrowing base rules set forth in the ge credit agreement 
on february   we received a letter from ge capital informing us that ge capital was applying a reserve against availability which effectively restricts our borrowings under the ge credit agreement to the balance outstanding as of february   which was  ge capital advised us that it was applying this reserve due to concerns about our financial performance  including our prospective compliance with the ebitda covenant in the ge credit agreement for the quarter that will end march  the restrictions on our ability to borrow under the ge credit agreement could have important adverse consequences on our future operations  including making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business  the industries in which we operate and the general economy  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have fewer restrictions on borrowing or greater access to capital 
if we are unable to convince ge capital to remove the restriction on our ability to borrow under the ge credit agreement or obtain otherwise suitable financing  we may not be able to meet our payment and other obligations which could significantly and materially harm our business and we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
there is no guarantee that we will be successful in convincing ge capital to remove the restriction on our ability to borrow or that we will be able to obtain otherwise suitable financing 
our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our compliance with the terms of our credit agreement  and on the availability of additional financing 
our ge credit agreement contains a number of agreements and covenants that we may not be able to comply with 
should a default be declared  we would have to repay any money borrowed thereunder and this would threaten our ability to continue as a going concern 
alternative financing could replace our relationship with ge capital  but if we are forced to seek that financing we do not believe it would be on favorable terms and there can be no assurance as to the amount of any financing that might be available 
we have received an extension from our lender pertaining to a loan covenant  but may not receive a further extension or waiver of the covenant  which would entitle our lender to exercise default remedies 
our ge credit agreement requires us to enter into control agreements with respect to each of our deposit  securities  commodity or similar accounts as our lenders shall reasonably request 
failure to obtain such control agreements constitutes a default under the ge credit agreement 
ge capital has extended the deadline 
table of contents for entering into a control agreement for one of our accounts until march  however  there is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining such a control agreement or that ge capital will grant us a further extension of the deadline by march  in the event of a default resulting from the failure to obtain such a control agreement or extension  ge capital will have the option of exercising all of its rights and remedies under the ge credit agreement arising as a result of the alleged events of default  including the right i to accelerate our loan obligations  ii to increase the interest rate to the default rate under the ge credit agreement  and iii to repossess and take other action with respect to any or all collateral under the ge credit agreement 
inadequate liquidity could materially adversely affect our business operations 
we require substantial liquidity to implement long term cost savings and restructuring plans  continue capital spending to support product programs and development of advanced technologies  meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities  and run our normal business operations 
if we continue to operate at or below the minimum cash levels necessary to support our normal business operations  we may be forced to further curtail capital spending  research and development and other programs that are important to the future success of our business 
as discussed above  ge capital has responded to the weakening of our liquidity position by placing a restriction on our ability to borrow under the ge credit agreement 
it is likely that if we were to lose our ability to access amounts under the ge credit agreement  that we would be unable to find additional capital or alternative financing necessary to sustain our current business operations 
if we fail to obtain sufficient funding for any reason  we would not be able to continue as a going concern 
our lack of liquidity has caused us to be unable to make payments when due under our exclusive distribution agreement with massachusetts biologic laboratories 
due to our limited liquidity  we were unable to make a payment of approximately  for td vaccine products which was due to our strategic partner  mbl  by february  under our mbl distribution agreement 
while we made a partial payment of  to mbl on march   we were also unable to make another payment of approximately  due to mbl on march  accordingly  we have entered into a letter agreement with mbl on march  mbl letter agreement  pursuant to which we agreed to pay mbl the  remaining due for these td vaccine products plus an additional  in consideration of the amendments to the mbl distribution agreement payable according to a periodic payment schedule through june  in addition  pursuant to the mbl letter agreement  the mbl distribution agreement was converted to a non exclusive agreement  we are obligated to provide mbl with a standby letter of credit by april  to secure our obligation to pay amounts due to mbl  and we will be released from our obligation to further purchase td vaccine products from mbl upon providing mbl with such letter of credit 
in addition  pursuant to the mbl letter agreement  mbl agreed not to declare a breach or otherwise act to terminate the mbl distribution agreement provided that we comply with the terms of the mbl letter agreement  the mbl distribution agreement as amended by the mbl letter agreement and any agreements required to be entered into pursuant to the mbl letter agreement 
we anticipate that dr 
john kapoor  the chairman of our board of directors and one of our principal shareholders  will provide the standby letter of credit to mbl pursuant to the mbl letter agreement 
if for any reason we are unable to provide the standby letter of credit to mbl by april  or if we are unable to make any payment under the mbl letter agreement when due and mbl is unable to draw on the standby letter of credit  we would be in breach of the mbl letter agreement which could significantly and materially harm our business and cause us to not be able to continue as a going concern 
we expect that dr 
kapoor will be compensated in an amount to be determined for providing the standby letter of credit 
we must obtain additional capital to continue our operations 
we will require additional funds to operate and grow our business 
we may seek additional funds through public and private financing  including equity and debt offerings 
however  adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to us 
without sufficient additional funding  we may be required to delay  scale back or abandon some or all of our product development  manufacturing  acquisition  licensing and marketing initiatives  or operations 
further  such additional financing  if obtained  likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders  and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest 
unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business 
our general business strategy may be adversely affected by the recent economic downturn and volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
if the current equity and credit markets deteriorate further  or do not improve  it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult  more costly  and more dilutive 
a prolonged or profound economic 
table of contents downturn may result in adverse changes to product reimbursement  pricing or sales levels  which would harm our operating results 
there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers  manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times  which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget 
failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy  financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans 
there is also a possibility that our stock price may decline  due in part to the volatility of the stock market and the general economic downturn 
we have invested significant resources in the development of lyophilization manufacturing capability  and we may not realize the benefit of these efforts and expenditures 
we have completed the final stages of an expansion of our decatur  illinois manufacturing facility to add capacity to provide lyophilization manufacturing services  a manufacturing capability we previously did not have 
as of december   we had spent  on the lyophilization facility expansion 
in december  we placed the sterile solutions portion of this operation in service which augments our existing production capacities 
the remaining  which is specific to lyophilization freeze dry operations was validated and placed in service in december we are producing our lyophilized ic green product on this equipment and are working to internally develop an anda lyophilized products pipeline 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be successful in attaining additional lyophilization customers or products  or that other intervening events will not occur that reduce or eliminate the additional benefits from such capability 
for instance  the market for lyophilized products could significantly diminish or be eliminated  or new technological advances could render the lyophilization process obsolete 
there can be no assurance that we will realize all the anticipated benefits from our significant investment into lyophilization capability at our decatur manufacturing facility  and our failure to do so could significantly limit our ability to grow our business in the future 
we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect 
a small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a large portion of our gross sales  revenues and accounts receivable 
the following three wholesalers  amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson  accounted for approximately of total gross sales and of total revenues in  and of gross trade receivables as of december  in addition to acting as distributors of our products  these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
the loss of one or more of these wholesalers  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations and lead to a violation of debt covenants 
a change in purchasing patterns  inventory levels  increases in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations 
our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and manufacturing capabilities 
our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and  when appropriate  the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels 
we may not meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that we have submitted or anticipate submitting 
our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or  if developed  successfully integrate new products into our existing product lines 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary fda approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays  which adversely affect the marketing and sale of our products 
our failure to develop new products  to maintain substantial compliance with fda compliance guidelines or to receive fda approval of andas or ndas  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we have entered into several strategic business alliances which may not result in marketable products 
we have entered several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products 
since  we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements  license agreements  and a joint venture that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline 
the joint venture company has generated several product introductions  however  there can be no assurance that these agreements will result in additional fda approved andas or ndas  or that we will be able to market any such additional products at a profit 
in addition  any clinical trial expenses that we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully market and distribute new products  including vaccine products  through various distribution channels 
we continue to seek out and introduce new pharmaceutical healthcare products 
our improved financial performance is dependent on new product introductions  such as the biologics and vaccine products discussed above 
any delays or an inability to successfully market and distribute such products may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
in particular  continued growth for our td vaccine product is dependent on successful management of market penetration on hospital group purchasing organization contracts 
we have accumulated substantial td vaccine inventory which may be difficult to sell 
we have accumulated substantial td vaccine inventory quantities which will require time to sell and may require discounting to generate cash flow to fund operations for the company 
in addition  we have lost our exclusive distribution rights for this td vaccine product as per the mbl letter agreement dated march  while we anticipate selling at prices in excess of our carrying value  extensive discounting to generate cash for our operations and or discounting to respond to competitor pricing could be required and  if so  this would adversely impact our profit margins which could impact our ability to continue as a going concern 

table of contents our success depends on the development of generic and off patent pharmaceutical products which are particularly susceptible to competition  substitution policies and reimbursement policies 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate which branded pharmaceuticals are about to come off patent and thus permit us to develop  manufacture and market equivalent generic pharmaceutical products 
generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than that of branded pharmaceuticals 
generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments  as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing 
there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement 
in addition  generic products that third parties develop may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future 
an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell 
in addition  governmental and cost containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products 
we attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through  among other things  creation of strong brand name recognition and product line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
we can be subject to legal proceedings against us  which may prove costly and time consuming even if meritless 
in the ordinary course of our business  we can be involved in legal actions with both private parties and certain government agencies 
to the extent that our personnel may have to spend time and resources to pursue or contest any matters that may be asserted from time to time in the future  this represents time and money that is not available for other actions that we might otherwise pursue which could be beneficial to our future 
in addition  to the extent that we are unsuccessful in any legal proceedings  the consequences could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties  which we cannot control 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of products manufactured by third parties  including our competitors in some instances 
there can be no assurance that our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of such products will not adversely affect our profit margins or our ability to develop and deliver our products on a timely and competitive basis 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute certain of our products as planned 
no assurance can be made that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
any delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our directors are subject to conflicts of interest 
dr 
john n 
kapoor  phd  the chairman of our board of directors  a member of the committee of the board overseeing our operations until a new president and chief executive officer have been appointed  our chief executive officer from march to december  and a principal shareholder  is affiliated with ej financial enterprises  inc ej financial  a health care consulting investment company 
ej financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields  and dr 
kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies 
the john n 
kapoor trust dated the kapoor trust  the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is dr 
kapoor  is a principal shareholder of each of these companies 
as a result  dr 
kapoor does not devote his full time to our business 
although such companies do not currently compete directly with us  certain companies with which ej financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business 
discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete 
the kapoor trust is also one of our lenders through a subordinated note 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subordinated debt 
potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dr 
subhash kapre is a member of our board of directors and is the executive director of serum 
we are a party to several product development agreements with serum and additional future agreements or changes to existing agreements have the potential to create a conflict of interest for dr 
kapre 
dependence on key executive officers 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers 
we are particularly dependent upon dr 
john n 
kapoor  phd  chairman of our board of directors 
the inability to attract and retain key executive officers  or the loss of one 
table of contents or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
through stock ownership  his position on our board of directors  and his loans to us  dr 
john kapoor has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies 
dr 
john kapoor owns  directly and indirectly  a substantial portion of our outstanding voting common stock 
dr 
kapoor is also chairman of our board of directors and also is a member of the special committee that is overseeing our operations until a new president and chief executive officer is appointed 
further  dr 
kapoor is a substantial creditor of ours 
because of this  dr 
kapoor can strongly influence  and potentially control  the outcome of our corporate actions  including the election of our directors and transactions involving a change of control 
decisions made by dr 
kapoor with respect to his  and his related parties  ownership or trading of our common stock  or with regards to our outstanding debt  could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business 
recent changes in our senior management may cause uncertainty in  or be disruptive to  our business 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management and our board of directors 
on january  arthur przybyl vacated the positions of president and chief executive officer 
on this same date  the board of directors formed a committee to oversee our operations until a new president and chief executive officer is appointed and begins service in those positions 
the committee is comprised of dr 
john kapoor  chairman of the board of directors  and randall wall and jerry ellis  both members of the board of directors 
mr 
przybyl resigned from his position as a director on our board of directors on february  the vacancy created by mr 
przybyl s resignation as a director has not yet been filled 
these changes in our senior management and our board of directors may be disruptive to our business  and  during the transition period  there may be uncertainty among investors  vendors  rating agencies  employees and others concerning our future direction and performance 
we must continue to attract and retain key personnel to be able to compete successfully 
our performance depends  to a large extent  on the continued service of our key research and development personnel  other technical employees  managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel 
we are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines  prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities 
federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business 
the development  testing  manufacturing  processing  quality  safety  efficacy  packaging  labeling  record keeping  distribution  storage and advertising of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from such activities  are subject to regulation by the fda  dea  ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities 
noncompliance with applicable united states and or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new  modified and additional regulations  statutes or legal interpretation  if any  could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  the recall  replacement or discontinuation of certain products  additional record keeping and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and scientific substantiation 
such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item business government regulation 
fda regulations 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us  are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act 
under the fdc act  the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations 
this authority includes  but is not limited to  the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non complying products  to enjoin non complying activities  to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmp  to recall products  to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators 
other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications or the withdrawal of 
table of contents previously approved applications 
any such enforcement activities  including the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  product recalls may be issued at our discretion  or at the request of the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products 
recalls may occur due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or other reasons 
no assurance can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales  halting of manufacturing operations or recalls of our pharmaceutical products will not occur in the future 
any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  such actions  in certain circumstances  could constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing relationships 
we must obtain approval from the fda for each pharmaceutical product that we market which requires a regulatory submission 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies or impose other post marketing obligations 
we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing  distribution  and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the fda imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy 
the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs 
a finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with fda requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we were previously subject to an fda warning letter which the fda issued to us in october which was subsequently removed in in march  we were again subject to a warning letter at our decatur facility which was removed in december see item business fda warning letter 
if the fda changes its regulatory position  it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain products 
we believe that all of our current products are in substantial compliance with fda regulations and have received the requisite agency approvals for their manufacture and sale 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
any change in the fda s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for one of our products not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a number of products we market are non application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without fda issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed prior to the amendment of the fdc act 
the regulatory status of these products is subject to change and or challenge by the fda  which could establish new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing such products  or challenge the evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based 
any such change in the status of such product could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive dea regulation  which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized 
we also manufacture and sell drugs which are controlled substances as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws  which impose  among other things  certain licensing  security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies  as well as quotas for the manufacture  purchase and sale of controlled substances 
the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market 
see item business dea regulation 
we may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims  we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products may prove to be defective and cause a health risk 
in that event  we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority 
we have recalled products in the past and  based on this experience  believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us  potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity  all of which could harm our ability to market our products 
we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during  due to the third quarter recall notification by bd  of their ml syringe 
this syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along 
table of contents with drug components manufactured and sourced by us  to support the cyanide antidote kit 
our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was necessitated by the bd recall  and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace 
our supporting efforts were reviewed by the fda  as part of our due diligence in apprising the agency of our reaction to the bd recall 
there were no product recalls in or although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings  we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future 
even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity  hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business 
successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of  for aggregate annual claims with a  deductible per incident and a  aggregate annual deductible 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the fda may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non prescription basis  which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products 
from time to time  the fda elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis  without a prescription 
fda approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and  accordingly  reduce our profits 
our industry is very competitive 
additionally  changes in technology could render our products obsolete 
we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies  including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours  in developing  acquiring  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies  may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete  and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner  and therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of our products 
we believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price  service and technical capabilities 
there can be no assurance that i we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  ii additional competitors will not enter the market  or iii competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline 
further  in the case of many of our andas and ndas  only one supplier of raw materials has been identified 
because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications  fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products  we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes 
the patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and is the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights  including licensed rights  relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured  or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights  if any  will provide protection against competitors who i successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights  ii obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or iii are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position 
it is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us  which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or obsoleting those that we are planning to develop  or duplicate any of our products 
our inability to obtain patents for  or other proprietary rights in  our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentrated ownership of our common stock and our registration of shares for public sale creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price 
the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have registered  shares held by certain of our investors for sale under registration statements on forms s and s filed with the sec 
sales of these shares on the open market could cause the price of our stock to decline 
exercise of warrants and options may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock 
if the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any warrants or stock options is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities  exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock which may result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
we may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors may determine whether to issue additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock 
if we issue additional shares of preferred stock  it could affect the rights or reduce the value of our common stock 
in particular  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party 
these terms may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemption rights  and sinking fund provisions 
we continue to seek capital for the growth of our business  and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of additional preferred stock 

table of contents we experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations  which may increase the volatility of our stock price 
our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products  the failure to develop such products  delays in obtaining government approvals  including fda approval of ndas or andas for our products  expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities  expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products  changes in our customer base  a customer s termination of a substantial account  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors  loss of key personnel  changes in the mix of products sold by us  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  competitive pricing pressures  expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding losses in any future period 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
penny stock rules may make buying or selling our common stock difficult 
as of march   the market price of our common stock did not exceed per share 
because our market price has fallen below per share  trading in our common stock may be subject to the penny stock rules 
the sec has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
these rules would require that any broker dealer that would recommend our common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors  must  prior to the sale  make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to execute the transaction 
unless an exception is available  the regulations would require the delivery  prior to any transaction involving a penny stock  of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market 
in addition  broker dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by such requirements may discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our common stock 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our reported revenues  profitability  and financial condition 
our financial statements are subject to the application of us generally accepted accounting principles  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
the application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time 
accordingly  we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by recognized authoritative bodies  including the financial accounting standards board and the sec 
those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues  profitability  and financial condition 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act 
these requirements are extensive 
the exchange act requires that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight is required 
this may divert management s attention from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations as a result of our lack of liquidity  limited capital resources  continued operating losses and accumulated debt  we have concluded there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  and accordingly  our independent registered public accounting firm has modified their report on our december  consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k in the form of an explanatory paragraph describing the events that have given rise to this uncertainty 
these factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional funding to meet our obligations 
our continuation is dependent upon our ability to generate or obtain sufficient cash to meet our obligations on a timely basis 
our losses since have totaled  based on our operating plan  our existing working capital is not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund our planned operating expenses  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements though december  without additional sources of cash and or the deferral  reduction or elimination of significant planned expenditures 
we are evaluating alternatives for cost reduction as well as certain efficiency and cost containment measures to improve our profitability and cash flow 
in addition  we are actively seeking additional financing for our operations 
currently  we have no commitments to obtain additional capital  and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
see item a 
risks relating to our credit agreement and inadequate liquidity could materially adversely affect our business operations in the future 
management has previously reduced our cost structure  improved our processes and systems and implemented new controls over capital and operational spending and we will continue such cost reduction and efficiency measures along with targeted working capital improvements 
we anticipate sales growth through our internal product development efforts  additional contract services opportunities which we are actively pursuing and ongoing progress we are achieving with our strategic partners on new products development 
management believes that continued emphasis on these activities will benefit our results of operations  cash flow from operations and our future prospects 
during the fiscal year ended december  and for the nine months ended september   we had three reporting segments 
our reportable segments are based upon internal financial reports that disaggregate certain operating information 
our chief operating decision maker  as defined in sfas no 
 is our chief executive officer  or ceo 
effective march   our cfo was appointed as our interim ceo  and as such  oversees operational assessments and resource allocations based upon the results of our reportable segments  all of which have available discrete financial information 
in september  we introduced our adult tetanus diphtheria td vaccine 
this product  as well as other similar products we introduced since and plan to introduce  will be evaluated separately from our other reportable segments 
as such  we created a new reportable segment called biologics and vaccines as of the fourth quarter of accordingly  we have modified our method of operating and evaluating our business units and  as a result  we modified our business reporting from three identifiable reporting segments to four segments in accordance with sfas this had no impact on prior year segment classifications 
our revenues are derived from sales of diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals in our ophthalmic segment  from sales of diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals in our hospital drugs and injectables segment  from sales of vaccines  and from contract services revenue

table of contents comparison of twelve months ended december  and consolidated revenues increased  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  mainly due to increased sales of td vaccine and the launch of flu vaccine along with moderate increases in other product segments 
vaccine sales increased by  of which  related to our td vaccine products and  related to our initial launch of our flu vaccine products 
ophthalmic segment revenues increased  or  primarily due to increased sales from a new ophthalmic solution launched in the first quarter of and sales of akten tm  a new topical ophthalmic drug launched in the fourth quarter of hospital drugs and injectables segment revenues increased or  for the year  reflecting the increased sales of anesthesia and antidote products 
contract services revenues increased by  or  mainly due to increased order volumes on ophthalmic contract products 
the chargeback and rebate expense  a component of net revenues  for the year ended december   decreased to  from  in this decrease was primarily due to product mix and increased sales volumes through distributors which do not generate chargebacks

year to date consolidated gross profit of  was of net revenues for as compared to a gross profit of  or for  mainly due to the  of gross profit contributed by vaccine sales combined with the sales increases for each segment discussed above 
the higher gross profit percentage was due to lower purchase costs for unit dose td vaccine  partially offset by lower margin flu vaccine sales 
the gross profit of our ophthalmic segment increased  or due to our launch of our new ophthalmic products including akten tm 
our hospital drugs and injectables segment gross profit increased  or mainly due to increased mix of antidote sales 
our biologics vaccines segment gross profit was  or due to our continued growth of market share for td vaccine and launch of flu vaccines in and the shift to higher margin unit dose td versus the multi dose td sold in our contract services segment gross profit increased  or from the prior year mainly due to stronger volumes on contract ophthalmic products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased  to  for from  for the key components of this increase in were  for additional field and vaccine sales representatives and related selling expenses   related to increased technical consulting and professional fees   for increased advertising and sales meeting expenses   for increased fda facility and product fees  and  for increased building rent related to our new gurnee  illinois warehouse and lake forest  illinois corporate headquarters  offset by decreased sfas r stock compensation expense of  and decreased recruiting and relocation fees of  research and development r d expense decreased  by  or in  to  from  for the year  mainly due to reduced product development activities and reduced milestone payments to our strategic business partners 
these reductions were partially offset by the first quarter write off of certain product related filing and license

hospital drugs and injectables segment revenues decreased or  for the year  reflecting the decreased volumes of anesthesia and antidote products 
in particular  sales of dtpa radiation antidote products to hhs were a primary driver for the sales decrease in this category 
this large order level for dtpa did not recur in  although we do anticipate continued orders for this antidote product 
sales of vaccines were introduced in the third quarter of  with total sales of  for the year 
contract services revenues decreased by  or  mainly due to decreased order volumes on contract products resulting from customer concerns with an fda warning letter issued in march which was subsequently removed in december the chargeback and rebate expense  a component of net revenues  for the year ended december   increased to  from  in  due to a higher percentage of sales to wholesalers  a general increase in the product sales mix of higher chargeback and rebate percentage items along with increased price competition 
note that sales of our dtpa antidote product to hhs were not subject to chargeback or rebate expense 
in  our product sales returns declined by  as we experienced an overall improvement on general product returns and  in addition  we assembled a team of key managers for a concerted effort to improve the inventory turnover and manage the stocking levels at our major customers to reduce product expiration returns 
consolidated gross profit of  was of net revenues for as compared to a gross profit of  or for the gross profit of our ophthalmic segment decreased  or due to a less favorable product mix and increased price competition 
our hospital drugs and injectables segment gross profit decreased  or mainly due to decreased sales of dtpa radiation antidote products to hhs as noted above and a less favorable product mix 
our biologics vaccines segment gross profit was  or due to current competitive market conditions 
our contract services segment gross profit decreased  or from the prior year mainly due to lower sales resulting from customer concerns regarding the march warning letter from the fda which was lifted in december our inventory at december  included a higher proportion of certain ophthalmic and hospital drugs injectable products which  on average  sell below their carrying value and  as a result  we increased our inventory reserve provision by  in to value these inventories at their net realizable value which decreased our overall gross profit 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased  to  for from  for the key components of this increase in were the addition of field and vaccine sales representatives and related selling expenses of  along with an increase in administrative compensation expense of  related to newly hired employees  an increase in fas r stock compensation expense of  and an increase in administrative travel of  partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense of  no bonuses were awarded for 

table of contents research and development r d expense decreased significantly  by in  to  from  for the year  mainly due to a reduction in validation testing and development of our lyophilization processes and spending for new product development  which was partially offset by a  increase in personnel costs

during  we used  in cash from operations as the net loss and increased inventory level was only partially offset by non cash expenses of  for the period  and a higher accounts payable level 
investing activities for generated a  reduction in cash flow mainly due to capital expenditures for new leased facilities and production equipment as well as  in funding to the joint venture company

on february   ge capital informed us that it was applying a reserve against availability  which effectively restricts our borrowings under the ge credit agreement to the balance that was outstanding as of february  see credit facility below 
the restriction on our ge credit agreement has severely limited our working capital and capital resources 
as a result of our lack of liquidity  limited capital resources  continued operating losses and accumulated debt  we have concluded there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern
