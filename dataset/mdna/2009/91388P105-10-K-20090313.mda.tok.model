item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a primarily non asset based provider of transportation services to shippers throughout the united states and in the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 
we offer flatbed and dry van trucking services  as well as rail truck and steamship truck intermodal and truck brokerage services 
we primarily operate through a contractor network of independent sales agents and owner operators of tractors and trailers 
in return for their services  we pay our agents and owner operators a percentage of the revenue they generate for us 
our owner operators provided us with approximately  tractors and approximately  trailers  which represented substantially all of the tractors and over of the trailers used in our business 
our use of agents and owner operators reduces our need to provide non driver facilities and tractor and trailer fleets 
the primary physical assets we provide to our agents and owner operators include a portion of our trailer fleet  our headquarters facility  our management information systems and our intermodal depot facilities 
our business model provides us with a highly variable cost structure  allows us to grow organically using relatively small amounts of cash  gives us a higher return on assets compared to many of our asset based competitors and preserves an entrepreneurial spirit among our agents and owner operators that we believe leads to improved operating performance 
in  approximately  of our total operating expenses were variable in nature 
our capital expenditures for were million 
in  our return on average assets was 
over the past seven years  our operating revenues have increased to million in from million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
our net income has increased to million in from million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
we have achieved this growth through a mixture of organic growth and acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions of companies that complement our non asset based business model  as well as companies that derive a portion of their revenues from asset based operations 
we believe that our willingness to expand our business to include a portion of asset based operations will expand the universe of potential acquisition targets  as most companies that we consider acquiring use a combination of asset based and non asset based operations 
we also intend to continue our organic growth  primarily by recruiting new agents and increasing the productivity of our existing agents 
we believe that increasing our agent network is critical to our ability to penetrate new shipping markets and also to expand our network of owner operators

revenues and expenses operating revenues 
we generate substantially all of our revenues through fees charged to customers for the transportation of freight 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  container storage and other services 
our revenue growth has been primarily driven by increases in the volume of freight shipped 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
the main factors that affect our shipping rates are competition  available truck capacity  and economic market conditions 
we recognize our revenues at the time of delivery to the receiver s location 
purchased transportation 
purchased transportation represents the amount we pay our owner operators or other third party equipment providers to haul freight and includes the amount of fuel surcharges that we pass through to our owner operators 
the amount of the purchased transportation we pay to our owner operators is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of our revenue for each load hauled 
purchased transportation is the largest component of our costs and increases or decreases proportionately with changes in the amount of revenue generated by our owner operators and other third party providers 
we recognize purchased transportation expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 
commissions expense 
commissions expense represents the amount we pay our agents for generating shipments on our behalf 
the commissions we pay to our agents are generally established through informal oral agreements and are based on a percentage of revenue generated by each load hauled 
traditionally  commissions increase or decrease in proportion to the revenues generated through our agents 
we recognize commission expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 

table of contents other operating expense 
other operating expenses represent the repair  tires and parts expenses primarily related to the maintenance of company owned leased trailers and lift equipment  and operating taxes and licenses  net of the rental income we receive from leasing our trailers to our owner operators 
we recognize these expenses as they are incurred and the rental income as it is earned 
selling  general and administrative 
employee compensation and benefits historically have accounted for over of our selling  general and administrative expense 
other components of selling  general and administrative expense include customer bad debt allowance  communications and rent expense 
insurance and claims 
insurance and claims expense represents our insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
our insurance premiums are generally calculated based on the size of our tractor fleet 
our accruals have primarily related to cargo and property damage claims 
we may also make accruals for personal injuries and property damage to third parties  physical damage to our equipment  and workers compensation claims if we experience a claim in excess of our insurance coverage 
to reduce our exposure to non trucking use liability claims claims incurred while the vehicle is being operated without a trailer attached or is being operated with an attached trailer which does not contain or carry any cargo  we require our owner operators to maintain non trucking use liability coverage  which we refer to as deadhead bobtail coverage  of million per occurrence 
our exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third party providers who haul freight on our behalf is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
our insurance expense varies primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  the market for insurance  our coverage limits and our self insured retention amounts 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to the depreciation of trailers  management information services equipment  buildings and equipment 
on january   we revised the estimated salvage value of our trailers 
previously we estimated that trailers had no salvage value at the end of their useful life of seven years 
however  based on our evaluation of the current market conditions for used trailers  we estimate that our trailers will have a salvage value equal to of their original cost 
as a result  the estimated salvage value for all trailers owned as of january  has been revised to equal of their original cost 
additionally for any trailers acquired after january  we will use an estimated salvage value of of their original costs

we do not expect any material change to our effective income tax rate in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are the funds generated by operations and our revolving unsecured line of credit with keybank 
we employ a primarily non asset based operating strategy 
substantially all of the tractors and more than of the trailers utilized in our business are provided by our owner operators and we have no capital expenditure requirements relating to this equipment 
as a result  our capital expenditure requirements are limited in comparison to most large trucking companies which maintain sizable fleets of owned tractors and trailers  requiring significant capital expenditures 

table of contents in  we have made capital expenditures totaling million 
these expenditures can be segregated into equipment purchases totaling million and real property acquisitions totaling million 
equipment purchases consist primarily of tractors  trailers  computer equipment and other miscellaneous equipment 
real property acquisitions consist of land and buildings and land improvements 
in  exclusive of acquisitions  we expect to incur capital expenditures of million to million relating to real property acquisitions  renovations and improvements to our existing facilities and the acquisition of additional terminal yards or container facilities 
we also expect to incur capital expenditures of million to million for tractors  trailers and other equipment 
additionally  in the st quarter of  we expect to pay a special cash dividend of million 
the company intends to use cash and cash equivalents to fund this payment and expects to maintain sufficient liquidity for operational needs after funding this payment 
we expect that our working capital and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our capital commitments and fund our operational needs for at least the next twelve months 
based on the availability under our line of credit and other financing sources and assuming the continuation of our current level of profitability  we do not expect that we will experience any liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate business development opportunities  including potential acquisitions that fit our strategic plans 
there can be no assurance that we will identify any opportunities that fit our strategic plans or will be able to execute any such opportunities on terms acceptable to us 
any such opportunities will be financed from available cash on hand and our unsecured line of credit 
on march   the company closed the million line of credit with first tennessee bank because the company had completed its transition of banking activities to keybank 
unsecured line of credit the company and keybank national association  or keybank  entered into a first amendment to loan agreement and first amendment to promissory note  or the agreement  dated october  for the period october  to october   amending the previous loan agreement dated october  for the period october  to october   which terminated due to the expiration of its term 
under the amended agreement with keybank  our maximum permitted borrowings and letters of credit in the aggregate may not exceed million 
the line of credit is unsecured  and bears interest at a rate equal to the lesser of the prime rate minus or libor plus effective rate of at december  
the agreement governing our unsecured line of credit contains various financial and restrictive covenants to be maintained by us including requiring us to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million  a debt to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  and quarterly net profits of at least one dollar 
for purposes of this agreement  tangible net worth is defined as total assets  excluding all intangible assets  less total debt 
the agreement also may  in certain circumstances  limit our ability to pay dividends or distributions 
the agreement also contains customary representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants and events of default 
as of december   the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
the company did not have any amounts outstanding under its line of credit at december   and there were  letters of credit issued against the line 
the agreement will not restrict our ability to pay the special dividend of million as approved by the board of directors on february  discussion of cash flows at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million in resulted from million in cash generated from operations  offset by million in cash used in investing activities and million in cash used in financing activities 

table of contents the million in cash provided by operations was primarily attributed to million of net income and million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  million of impairment charges on marketable securities classified as available for sale  million of non cash charges for bad debt expense  and a decrease in the working capital position of the company of million 
the decrease in the working capital position is primarily the result of a decrease in accounts receivable and related amounts payable to drivers due to the lower revenue volumes near the close of and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other due to lower prepaid insurance and rents 
the million in net cash used in investing activities for consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million and million for the acquisition of businesses 
in addition  the company purchased and sold marketable securities totaling million and million  respectively 
in the st quarter of  we expect to pay a special cash dividend of million 
the company expects to use cash and cash equivalents to fund this payment 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the long term debt represents the amount due under the loan from the county of cuyahoga  ohio  upon maturity and the un forgiven amounts to be forgiven provided the company meets the conditions for forgiveness at each measurement period 
the above purchase obligations relate to firm purchase commitments for properties and trailers 
as of december   the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was  this amount is not included in the above table as the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of cash settlements  if any  with taxing authorities 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with the acquisition of assure  we are required to pay cash consideration to the former owners of assure based on a percentage of revenues generated through january in connection with the acquisition of djewels  we are required to pay cash consideration to the former owner of djewels based on a percentage of revenues generated through february in connection with the acquisition of tristar  we are required to pay cash consideration to the former owners of tristar based on a percentage of revenues generated through july in connection with the acquisition of glenn  we are required to pay cash consideration to the former owners of glenn based on a percentage of revenues generated through november in connection with the acquisition of overnite  we are required to pay cash consideration to the former owners of overnite based on a percentage of revenues generated through june 
table of contents legal matters we are subject to various legal proceedings and other contingencies  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we accrue for estimated losses if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we use judgment and evaluate  with the assistance of legal counsel  whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be disclosed or recorded 
the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and so typically a loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  if the outcome of legal proceedings are different than is anticipated by us  we would have to record a charge for the matter  generally in the full amount at which it was resolved  in the period resolved  negatively impacting our results of operations and financial position for the period 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  operating revenues and operating expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
management continuously monitors these factors to arrive at the estimate of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators 
past due balances over days and over  are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates 
changes in the facts and circumstances that these estimates are based upon and changes in the general economic environment could result in a material change to the allowance for uncollectible receivables 
these changes include  but are not limited to  deterioration of customers financial position  changes in our relationships with our customers  agents and owner operators and unforeseen issues relating to individual receivables 
insurance and claim costs we maintain auto liability  workers compensation and general liability insurance with licensed insurance carriers 
we are self insured for all cargo and equipment damage claims 
insurance and claims expense represents premiums paid by us and the accruals made for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
a liability is recognized for the estimated cost of all self insured claims including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and for claims expected to exceed the our policy limits 
in addition  we are responsible for all of the legal expenses related to claims 
as of december   we did not have any reserves for workers compensation or general liability claims 
we do establish reserves for anticipated losses and expenses related to cargo and equipment damage claims and auto liability claims 
the reserves consist of specific reserves for all known claims and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported  and losses arising from known claims ultimately settling in excess of insurance 
table of contents coverage using loss development factors based upon industry data and past experience 
in determining the reserves  we specifically review all known claims and record a liability based upon our best estimate of the amount to be paid 
in making our estimate  we consider the amount and validity of the claim  as well as our past experience with similar claims 
in establishing the reserve for claims incurred but not reported  we consider our past claims history  including the length of time it takes for claims to be reported to us 
based on our past experience  the time between when a claim occurs and when it is reported to us is short 
as a result  we believe that the number of incurred but not reported claims at any given point in time is small 
these reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect our experience and updated information relating to specific claims 
if we experience claims that are not covered by our insurance or that exceed our estimated claim reserve  it could increase the volatility of our earnings and have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation of long lived asset  including goodwill and intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently  whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill below its carrying amount 
we annually test goodwill impairment on the st day of our rd fiscal quarter 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired in connection with the our acquisitions 
we continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  overall weaknesses in our industry  and slower growth rates 
adverse changes in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  we compare the fair value of each of the company s reporting units with goodwill to their related carrying values 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and we must perform step two of the impairment test 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units utilizing the income approach through the application of a discounted cash flow analysis 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit are a future expected cash flows  b estimated residual growth rates  and c discount rates  which were based on the company s best estimates of the after tax weighted average cost of capital of 
additionally  the company considers its market capitalization in comparison to the fair value of its reporting units 
during the third quarter of  we completed our goodwill impairment testing and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill exceeded the carrying value of its net assets 
accordingly  no impairment loss was recognized 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment by analyzing the operating performance and anticipated future cash flows for those assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the need to adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value 
our projection of future cash flows  the level of actual cash flows  the methods of estimation used for determining fair values and salvage values can impact impairment 
any changes in management s judgments could result in greater or lesser annual depreciation and amortization expense or impairment charges in the future 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
other than temporary impairments periodically  we review all available for sale securities for other than temporary impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and sec staff accounting 
table of contents bulletin  or sab  no 
 which has been codified as sab topic m other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities 
an impairment that is an other than temporary impairment is a decline in the fair value of a security below its cost basis attributable to factors that indicate the cost basis in the security may not be recoverable in the near term 
the determination of an other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  and requires judgment and assumptions that could affect the timing of loss realization 
we consider several factors including the severity and duration of the decline  the financial condition and near term prospects of the specific issuers and the industries in which they operate  and our ability intent and ability to hold these securities for a sufficient period of time to allow for a recovery 
if  in our judgment  the impairment is determined to be other than temporary impairment  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current market value  and the unrealized loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive loss as an immediate reduction of current earnings 
gross unrealized holding losses of million as of december  have not been recognized in earnings as these impairments in value were judged to be temporary 
we may incur future impairment charges if declines in market values continue or worsen and impairments are no longer considered temporary

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risk is affected by changes in interest rates 
our unsecured line of credit with key bank bears interest at a floating rate equal to the lesser of the prime rate minus or libor plus 
accordingly  changes in the prime rate or libor would affect the interest rate on and therefore our cost under the line of credit 
we currently do not have an outstanding balance under our line of credit 
included in cash and cash equivalents is million in short term investment grade instruments 
the interest rates on these instruments are adjusted to market rates at least monthly 
in addition  we have the ability to put these instruments back to the issuer at any time 
accordingly  any future interest rate risk on these short term investments would not be material 
we did not have any interest rate swap agreements as of december  commodity price risk fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability by affecting our ability to retain or recruit owner operators 
our owner operators bear the costs of operating their tractors  including the cost of fuel 
the tractors operated by our owner operators consume large amounts of diesel fuel 
diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic  political and other factors beyond our control 
to address fluctuations in fuel prices  we seek to impose fuel surcharges on our customers and pass these surcharges on to our owner operators 
historically  these arrangements have not fully protected our owner operators from fuel price increases 
if costs for fuel escalate significantly it could make it more difficult to attract additional qualified owner operators and retain our current owner operators 
if we lose the services of a significant number of owner operators or are unable to attract additional owner operators  it could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
short term investments the company from time to time invests cash in excess of its current needs in marketable securities  much of which is held in equity securities  which are actively traded on public exchanges 
holding equity securities subjects the company to fluctuations in the market value of its investment portfolio based on current market prices 
a drop in market prices or other unstable market conditions could cause a loss in the value of the company s short term investments 
marketable securities are carried at fair value and are marked to market at the end of each quarter  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  unless the declines in value are judged to be other than temporary  in which case an impairment charge would be included in the determination of net income 
gross unrealized holding losses of million as of december  have not been recognized in earnings as these impairments in value were judged to be temporary 
we may incur future impairment charges if declines in market values continue or worsen and impairments are no longer considered temporary 
see part ii  item  note e of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december  the fair value of equity securities held as short term investments was million compared to million at december  the increase during the year ended december  represents additional purchases of million  partially offset by other than temporary charges of million on our remaining holdings  sales of million  and other net unrealized holding losses of million 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities would cause a corresponding decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities  or approximately thousand
