our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq global market if the closing bid price for our common stock is not maintained at per share or higher during any consecutive business days 
nasdaq imposes  among other requirements  listing maintenance standards as well as minimum bid and public float requirements 
the price of our common stock must trade at or above to comply with nasdaq s minimum bid requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
in recent months  our common stock has traded below per share at closing for brief periods of time 
if our common stock were to trade during any consecutive business days below the minimum closing bid price requirement  nasdaq would send us a deficiency notice advising us that we have calendar days to regain compliance 
in order to regain compliance  our common stock would need to maintain a closing bid price for a minimum of consecutive business days 
nasdaq has suspended its enforcement of the rules requiring a minimum closing bid price and announced that it will not take any action to delist any security traded on the nasdaq global market that fails to comply with the minimum closing bid price requirement between october  and april  consequently  for as long as nasdaq s rule suspension remains in effect  nasdaq will not delist our stock if the closing bid price for our common stock falls below per share during the rule suspension period 
if the closing bid price of our common stock fails to meet nasdaq s minimum closing bid price requirement for a period of consecutive business days at any time beginning on or after april   or on a later date to which nasdaq may extend its suspension of this requirement  or if we otherwise fail to meet all other applicable requirements of the nasdaq global market  nasdaq may make a determination to delist our common stock if we fail to regain compliance within a proscribed period 
any such delisting could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease and could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and or result in the loss of confidence by investors  customers  suppliers and employees 
we have incurred substantial losses in the past and may continue to incur losses in the future 
we have incurred net losses in four of the past five years and incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
there can be no guarantee that we will achieve profitability in the future 
if we achieve profitability  given the competitive and evolving nature of the industry in which we operate  we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from atms placed with a small number of merchants 
if one or more of our top merchants were to cease doing business with us  or to substantially reduce its dealings with us  our revenues could decline 
for the year ended december   we derived of our total revenues from atms placed at the locations of our five largest merchants 
for the year ended december   our top five merchants based on our total revenues were eleven  cvs  walgreens  target  and duane reade 
eleven  which is the single largest merchant customer in our portfolio  comprised over of our total revenues for the year ended december  accordingly  a significant percentage of our future revenues and operating income will be dependent upon the successful continuation of our relationship with eleven and these other four merchants 

table of contents the loss of any of our largest merchants or a decision by any one of them to reduce the number of our atms placed in their locations would result in a decline in our revenues 
furthermore  if their financial condition were to deteriorate in the future and  as a result  one of more of these merchants was required to close a significant number of their domestic store locations  our revenues would be significantly impacted 
these merchants may elect not to renew their contracts when they expire 
the contracts we have with our top five merchants have expiration dates of july   february   december   january   and december   respectively 
even if such contracts are renewed  the renewal terms may be less favorable to us than the current contracts 
if any of our five largest merchants enters bankruptcy proceedings and rejects its contract with us  fails to renew its contract upon expiration  or if the renewal terms with any of them are less favorable to us than under our current contracts  it could result in a decline in our revenues and gross profits 
a substantial portion of our revenues and operating profits are generated by our merchant relationship with eleven 
accordingly  if eleven s financial condition deteriorates in the future and it is required to close some or all of its store locations  or if our atm placement agreement with eleven expires or is terminated  our future financial results would be significantly impaired 
eleven is the single largest merchant customer in our portfolio  representing approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  accordingly  a significant percentage of our future revenues and operating income will be dependent upon the successful continuation of our relationship with eleven 
if eleven s financial condition were to deteriorate in the future and  as a result  it was required to close a significant number of its domestic store locations  our financial results would be significantly impacted 
additionally  while the underlying atm placement agreement with eleven has an initial term of years  we may not be successful in renewing such agreement with eleven upon the end of that initial term  or such renewal may occur with terms and conditions that are not as favorable to us as those contained in the current agreement 
furthermore  the atm placement agreement executed with eleven contains certain terms and conditions that  if we fail to meet such terms and conditions  gives eleven the right to terminate the placement agreement or our exclusive right to provide certain services 
we rely on eft network providers  transaction processors  armored courier providers  and maintenance providers  if they fail or no longer agree to provide their services  we could suffer a temporary loss of transaction revenues or the permanent loss of any merchant contract affected by such disruption 
we rely on eft network providers and have agreements with transaction processors  armored courier providers  and maintenance providers and have more than one such provider in each of these key areas 
these providers enable us to provide card authorization  data capture  settlement  and atm cash management and maintenance services to the merchants we serve 
typically  these agreements are for periods of up to two or three years each 
if we improperly manage the renewal or replacement of any expiring vendor contract  or if our multiple providers in any one key area failed to provide the services for which we have contracted and disruption of service to our merchants occurs  our relationship with those merchants could suffer 
for example  during the fourth quarter of and the full year of  our results of operations were negatively impacted by a higher percentage of downtime experienced by our atms in the united kingdom as a result of certain third party service related issues 
if such disruption of service continues  our relationships with the affected merchants could be materially negatively impacted 
furthermore  any disruptions in service in any of our markets  whether caused by us or by third party providers  may result in a loss of revenues under certain of our contractual arrangements that contain minimum service level requirements 
if we  our transaction processors  our eft networks or other service providers experience system failures  the atm products and services we provide could be delayed or interrupted  which would harm our business 
our ability to provide reliable service largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operations of our in house transaction processing platform  third party transaction processors  telecommunications network systems  and other service providers 
accordingly  any significant interruptions could severely harm our business and reputation and result in a loss of revenues 
additionally  if any such interruption is caused by us  especially in those situations in which we serve as the primary transaction processor  such interruption could result in the loss of the affected merchants or damage our relationships with such merchants 
our systems and operations and those of our transaction processors and our eft network and other service providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from fire  natural disaster  unlawful acts  terrorist attacks  power loss  telecommunications failure  unauthorized entry  and computer viruses 
we cannot be certain that any measures we and our service providers have taken to prevent system failures will be successful or that we will not experience service interruptions 

table of contents the inaccurate settlement of funds between the various parties to our atm transactions could harm our business and our relationships with our merchants 
as of december   we had transitioned approximately  of our company and merchant owned atms from third party processors to our own eft transaction processing platform 
if not performed properly  the processing of transactions conducted on our atms could result in the inaccurate settlement of funds between the various parties to those transactions and expose us to increased liability 
the armored transport business exposes us to additional risks beyond those currently experienced by us in the ownership and operation of atms 
to the extent we are unable to resolve the issues we have experienced with an armored courier in the united kingdom or experience similar issues in other markets  our operating results could be adversely affected 
during  we implemented our own in house armored courier operation in the united kingdom 
we are currently providing armored services to over of our atms in that market and expect to transition approximately additional locations over to our operation during the armored transport business exposes us to significant risks  including the potential for cash in transit losses  as well as claims for personal injury  wrongful death  worker s compensation  punitive damages  and general liability 
while we will seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance to adequately protect us from these risks  there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant future claims or adverse publicity related thereto 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover potential liabilities or that insurance coverage will remain available at costs that are acceptable to us 
the availability of quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in our ability to successfully operate this aspect of our operations 
a successful claim brought against us for which coverage is denied or that is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if not done properly  the transitioning of armored transport services from third party service providers to our own internal operations  whether in the united kingdom or elsewhere  could lead to service interruptions  which would harm our business and our relationships with our merchants 
we have no prior experience in providing armored transport services to the atm industry 
because this is a new business for us  there is an increased risk that our transition efforts will not be successful  thus resulting in service interruptions for our merchants 
furthermore  if not performed properly  the provisioning of armored transport services to our atms could result in the atms either running out of cash  thereby resulting in lost transactions and revenues  or having excess cash  thereby unnecessarily increasing our operating costs 
furthermore  if certain of these issues were to occur  it could damage our relationships with the affected merchants  thus negatively impacting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
security breaches could harm our business by compromising customer information and disrupting our atm transaction processing services  thus damaging our relationships with our merchant customers and exposing us to liability 
as part of our atm transaction processing services  we electronically process and transmit sensitive cardholder information utilizing our atms 
in recent years  companies that process and transmit this information have been specifically and increasingly targeted by sophisticated criminal organizations in an effort to obtain the information and utilize it for fraudulent transactions 
unauthorized access to our computer systems  or those of our third party service providers  could result in the theft or publication of the information or the deletion or modification of sensitive records  and could cause interruptions in our operations 
while the security risks outlined above are mitigated by the use of encryption and other techniques  any inability to prevent security breaches could damage our relationships with our merchant customers and expose us to liability 
computer viruses could harm our business by disrupting our atm transaction processing services  causing noncompliance with network rules and damaging our relationships with our merchant customers 
computer viruses could infiltrate our systems  thus disrupting our delivery of services and making our applications unavailable 
although we utilize several preventative and detective security controls in our network  any inability to prevent computer viruses could damage our relationships with our merchant customers and cause us to be in non compliance with applicable network rules and regulations 

table of contents operational failures in our atm transaction processing facilities could harm our business and our relationships with our merchant customers 
an operational failure in our atm transaction processing facilities could harm our business and damage our relationships with our merchant customers 
damage or destruction that interrupts our atm processing services could damage our relationships with our merchant customers and could cause us to incur substantial additional expense to repair or replace damaged equipment 
we have installed back up systems and procedures to prevent or react to such disruptions 
however  a prolonged interruption of our services or network that extends for more than several hours ie  where our backup systems are not able to recover could result in data loss or a reduction in revenues as our atms would be unable to process transactions 
in addition  a significant interruption of service could have a negative impact on our reputation and could cause our present and potential merchant customers to choose alternative atm service providers 
errors or omissions in the settlement of merchant funds could damage our relationships with our merchant customers and expose us to liability 
we are responsible for maintaining accurate bank account information for our merchant customers and accurate settlements of funds into these accounts based on the underlying transaction activity 
this process relies on accurate and authorized maintenance of electronic records 
although we have certain controls in place to help ensure the safety and accuracy of our records  errors or unauthorized changes to these records could result in the erroneous or fraudulent movement of funds  thus damaging our relationships with our merchant customers and exposing us to liability 
changes in interest rates could increase our operating costs by increasing interest expense under our credit facilities and our vault cash rental costs 
interest on our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving and swing line credit facilities is based on floating interest rates  and our vault cash rental expense is based on market interest rates 
as a result  our interest expense and cash management costs are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
vault cash is the cash we use in our machines in cases where cash is not provided by the merchant 
we pay rental fees on the average amount of vault cash outstanding in our atms under floating rate formulas based on the libor to bank of america and pdnb in the united states and alcb in the united kingdom  and based on the federal funds effective rate to wells fargo in the united states 
additionally  in mexico  we pay a monthly rental fee to our vault cash provider under a formula based on the mexican interbank rate 
although we currently hedge a significant portion of our vault cash interest rate risk related to our domestic operations through december   we may not be able to enter into similar arrangements for similar amounts in the future 
furthermore  we have not currently entered into any derivative financial instruments to hedge our variable interest rate exposure in the united kingdom or mexico 
any significant future increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on our earnings and cash flow by increasing our operating costs and expenses 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure about market risk  interest rate risk 
we maintain a significant amount of cash within our company owned atms  which is subject to potential loss due to theft or other events  including natural disasters 
as of december   there was approximately billion in vault cash held in our domestic and international atms 
although legal and equitable title to such cash is held by the cash providers  any loss of such cash from our atms through theft or other means is typically our responsibility 
while we maintain insurance to cover a significant portion of any losses that may be sustained by us as a result of such events  we are still required to fund a portion of such losses through the payment of the related deductible amounts under our insurance policies 
furthermore  any increase in the frequency and or amounts of such thefts and losses could negatively impact our operating results as a result of higher deductible payments and increased insurance premiums 
additionally  any damage sustained to our merchant customers store locations in connection with any atm related thefts  if extensive and frequent enough in nature  could negatively impact our relationships with such merchants and impair our ability to deploy additional atms in those locations or new locations with those merchants in the future 
finally  impacted merchants may request that we permanently remove atms from store locations that have suffered damage as a result of any atm related thefts  thus negatively impacting our financial results 

table of contents the atm industry is highly competitive and such competition may increase  which may adversely affect our profit margins 
the atm business is and can be expected to remain highly competitive 
while our principal competition comes from national and regional financial institutions  we also compete with other independent atm companies in the united states and the united kingdom 
several of our competitors  namely national financial institutions  are larger  more established  and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our competitors could prevent us from obtaining or maintaining desirable locations for our atms  cause us to reduce the surcharge revenue generated by transactions at our atms  or cause us to pay higher merchant fees  thereby reducing our profits 
in addition to our current competitors  additional competitors may enter the market 
we can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against these current and future competitors 
increased competition could result in transaction fee reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
in the united kingdom  we face competition from several companies with operations larger than our own 
many of these competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than our united kingdom subsidiary 
the election of our merchant customers to not participate in our surcharge free network offerings could impact the networks effectiveness  which would negatively impact our financial results 
financial institutions that are members of our allpoint and mastercard surcharge free networks pay a fee in exchange for allowing their cardholders to use selected cardtronics owned and or managed atms on a surcharge free basis 
the success of these networks is dependent upon the participation by our merchant customers in such networks 
in the event a significant number of our merchants elect not to participate in such networks  the benefits and effectiveness of the networks would be diminished  thus potentially causing some of the participating financial institutions to not renew their agreements with us  and thereby negatively impacting our financial results 
we may be unable to integrate our future acquisitions in an efficient manner and inefficiencies would increase our cost of operations and reduce our profitability 
we have been an active business acquirer both in the united states and internationally  and may continue to be active in the future 
the acquisition and integration of businesses involves a number of risks 
the core risks are in the areas of valuation negotiating a fair price for the business based on inherently limited due diligence and integration managing the complex process of integrating the acquired company s people  products  technology and other assets so as to realize the projected value of the acquired company and the synergies projected to be realized in connection with the acquisition 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of our combined businesses and the possible loss of key personnel 
the diversion of management s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with acquisitions and the integration of the two companies operations could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or prospects 
in addition  acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flows 
any shortfall in anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flows could require us to write down the carrying value of the intangible assets associated with any acquired company  which would adversely affect our reported earnings 
for example  during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment charge to write down the value of the goodwill associated with our investment in bank machine 
since april  we have acquired atm networks and one surcharge free atm network 
prior to our e trade access acquisition in june  we had acquired only the assets of deployed atm networks  rather than businesses and their related infrastructure 
we currently anticipate that our future acquisitions will likely reflect a mix of asset acquisitions and acquisitions of businesses  with each acquisition having its own set of unique characteristics 
to the extent that we elect to acquire an existing company or the operations  technology  and personnel of another atm provider  we may assume some or all of the liabilities associated with the acquired company and face new and added challenges integrating such acquisition into our operations 
any inability on our part to effectively manage our past or future growth could limit our ability to successfully grow the revenue and profitability of our business 

table of contents our international operations involve special risks and may not be successful  which would result in a reduction of our gross profits 
as of december   approximately of our atms were located in the united kingdom and mexico 
those atms contributed of our gross profits exclusive of depreciation  accretion  and amortization for the year ended december  we expect to continue to expand in the united kingdom and mexico and potentially into other countries as opportunities arise 
however  our international operations are subject to certain inherent risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  including the risk that our future reported operating results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable movements in the functional currencies of our international operations relative to the united states dollar  which represents our consolidated reporting currency  difficulties in complying with the different laws and regulations in each country and jurisdiction in which we operate  including unique labor and reporting laws  unexpected changes in laws  regulations  and policies of foreign governments or other regulatory bodies  including changes that could potentially disallow surcharging or that could result in a reduction in the amount of interchange fees received per transaction  unanticipated political and social instability that may be experienced in developing countries  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  including hiring and retaining skilled workers in those countries in which we operate  and potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of foreign earnings 
any of these factors could reduce the profitability and revenues derived from our international operations and international expansion 
for example  during the latter half of  we incurred reduced revenues from the united states dollar strengthening relative to the british pound and mexican peso 
additionally  the recent political and social instability in mexico resulting from an increase in drug related violence could negatively impact the level of transactions incurred on our existing atms in that market  as well as our ability to successfully grow our business there 
our proposed expansion efforts into new international markets involve unique risks and may not be successful 
we plan to expand our operations internationally with a focus on high growth emerging markets  such as those in central and eastern europe  central and south america  and asia pacific 
because the off premise atm industry is relatively undeveloped in these emerging markets  we may not be successful in these expansion efforts 
in particular  many of these markets do not currently employ or support an off premise atm surcharging model  meaning that we would have to rely on interchange fees as our primary source of revenues 
while we have had some success in deploying non surcharging atms in selected markets  such a model requires significant transaction volumes to make it economically feasible to purchase and deploy atms 
furthermore  most of the atms in these markets are owned and operated by financial institutions  thus increasing the risk that cardholders would be unwilling to utilize an off premise atm with an unfamiliar brand 
finally  the regulatory environments in many of these markets are evolving and unpredictable  thus increasing the risk that a particular deployment model chosen at inception may not be economically viable in the future 
we operate in a changing and unpredictable regulatory environment 
if we are subject to new legislation regarding the operation of our atms  we could be required to make substantial expenditures to comply with that legislation  which may reduce our net income and our profit margins 
with its initial roots in the banking industry  the us atm industry is regulated by the rules and regulations of the federal electronic funds transfer act  which establishes the rights  liabilities  and responsibilities of participants in eft systems 
the vast majority of states have few  if any  licensing requirements 
however  legislation related to the us atm industry is periodically proposed at the state and local level 
to date  no such legislation has been enacted that materially adversely affects our business 
in the united kingdom  the atm industry is largely self regulating 
most atms in the united kingdom are part of the link network and must operate under the network rules set forth by link  including complying with rules regarding required signage and screen messages 
additionally  legislation is proposed from time to time at the national level  though nothing to date has been enacted that materially affects our business 

table of contents finally  the atm industry in mexico has been historically operated by financial institutions 
banco de mexico supervises and regulates atm operations of both financial institutions and non bank atm deployers 
although  banco de mexico s regulations permit surcharge fees to be charged in atm transactions  it has not issued specific regulations for the provision of atm services 
in addition  in order for a non bank atm deployer to provide atm services in mexico  the deployer must be affiliated with prosa red or e global  which are credit card and debit card proprietary networks that transmit information and settle atm transactions between their participants 
as only financial institutions are allowed to be participants of prosa red or e global  cardtronics mexico entered into a joint venture with bansi  who is a member of prosa red 
as a financial institution  bansi and all entities in which it participates  including cardtronics mexico  are regulated by the ministry of finance and public credit secretaria de hacienda y cr dito p blico and supervised by the banking and securities commission comisi n nacional bancaria y de valores 
additionally  cardtronics mexico is subject to the provisions of the ley del banco de mexico law of banco de mexico  the ley de instituciones de cr dito mexican banking law  and the ley para la transparencia y ordenamiento de los servicios financieros law for the transparency and organization of financial services 
we will continue to monitor all such legislation and attempt  to the extent possible  to prevent the passage of such laws that we believe are needlessly burdensome or unnecessary 
if regulatory legislation is passed in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate  we could be required to make substantial expenditures which would reduce our net income 
the passing of legislation banning or limiting surcharge fees would severely impact our revenues 
despite the nationwide acceptance of surcharge fees at atms in the united states since their introduction in  consumer activists have from time to time attempted to impose local bans or limits on surcharge fees 
even in the few instances where these efforts have passed the local governing body such as with an ordinance adopted by the city of santa monica  california  federal courts have overturned these local laws on federal preemption grounds 
however  those efforts may resurface and  should the federal courts abandon their adherence to the federal preemption doctrine  those efforts could receive more favorable consideration than in the past 
any successful legislation banning or limiting surcharge fees could result in a substantial loss of revenues and significantly curtail our ability to continue our operations as currently configured 
in the united kingdom  the treasury select committee of the house of commons published a report regarding surcharges in the atm industry in march this committee was formed to investigate public concerns regarding the atm industry  including adequacy of disclosure to atm customers regarding surcharges  whether atm providers should be required to provide free services in low income areas and whether to limit the level of surcharges 
while the committee made numerous recommendations to parliament regarding the atm industry  including that atms should be subject to the banking code a voluntary code of practice adopted by all financial institutions in the united kingdom  the united kingdom government did not accept the committee s recommendations 
despite the rejection of the committee s recommendations  the united kingdom government did sponsor an atm task force to look at social exclusion in relation to atm services 
as a result of the task force s findings  approximately additional free to use atms to be provided by multiple atm providers were required to be installed in low income areas throughout the united kingdom while this is less than a increase in free to use atms throughout the united kingdom  there is no certainty that other similar proposals will not be made and accepted in the future 
if the legislature or another body with regulatory authority in the united kingdom were to impose limits on the level of surcharges for atm transactions  our revenue from operations in the united kingdom would be negatively impacted 
in mexico  surcharging for off premise atms was legalized in late  but was not formally implemented until july as such  the charging of fees to consumers to utilize off premise atms is a relatively new event in mexico 
accordingly  it is too soon to predict whether public concerns over surcharging will surface in mexico 
however  if such concerns were to be raised  and if the applicable legislative or regulatory bodies in mexico decided to impose limits on the level of surcharges for atm transactions  our revenue from operations in mexico would be negatively impacted 
the passing of legislation requiring modifications to be made to atms could severely impact our cash flows 
under a current ruling of the us district court  it was determined that the united states currencies as currently designed violate the rehabilitation act  as the paper currencies issued by the us are identical in size and color  regardless of denomination 
under the ruling  the us treasury department has been ordered to develop ways in which to differentiate paper currency such that an individual who is visually impaired would be able to distinguish between the different denominations 
while it is still uncertain at this time what the outcome of the appeals process will be  in the event the current ruling is not overturned  participants in the atm industry including us could be forced to incur costs to upgrade current machines hardware and software components depending on the nature of the modifications proposed by the us treasury department 

table of contents the passing of anti money laundering legislation could cause us to lose certain merchant accounts and reduce our revenues 
recent concerns by the us federal government regarding the use of atms to launder money could lead to the imposition of additional regulations on our sponsoring financial institutions and our merchant customers regarding the source of cash loaded into their atms 
in particular  such regulations could result in the incurrence of additional costs by individual merchants who load their own cash  thereby making their atms less profitable 
accordingly  some individual merchants may decide to discontinue their atm operations  thus reducing the number of merchant owned accounts that we currently manage 
if such a reduction were to occur  we would see a corresponding decrease in our revenues 
we have previously identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the sec rules with respect thereto  require management of public companies to assess the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting annually and to include in their annual reports on form k a management report on that assessment 
to that end  our management assessment as of december  has been reflected in part ii  item a 
controls and procedures of this form k 
additionally  we are required to include an attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
under section and the sec s rules  a company cannot find that its internal control over financial reporting is effective if any material weaknesses exist in its controls over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
for the year ended december   we identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 
during  we took appropriate actions to remediate the identified material weaknesses and improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
additional information regarding our remedial actions and our conclusions with respect thereto can be found in part ii  item a 
controls and procedures of this form k 
as a result  we believe that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  despite the above  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in future periods  as changing conditions in our operating environment and or inadequate responses on our part to those changing conditions could lead to material weakness disclosures in future periods 
any failure in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  if it results in misstatements in our financial statements  could have a material effect on our financial reporting or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations  and thus could negatively impact investor perceptions 

table of contents our operating results have fluctuated historically and could continue to fluctuate in the future  which could affect our ability to maintain our current market position or expand 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the following changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in the atm and financial services industries  changes in payment trends and offerings in the markets in which we operate  competition from other companies providing the same or similar services that we offer  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses  capital expenditures  and expenses related to the expansion of sales  marketing  and operations  including as a result of acquisitions  if any  the timing and magnitude of any impairment charges that may materialize over time relating to our goodwill  intangible assets or long lived assets  changes in the general level of interest rates in the markets in which we operate  changes in regulatory requirements associated with the atm and financial services industries  changes in the mix of our current services  and changes in the financial condition and credit risk of our customers 
any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we have experienced growth in revenues in recent quarters  this growth rate is not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short term  particularly with respect to personnel expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  and interest expense 
therefore  our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
as such  comparisons to prior periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance
