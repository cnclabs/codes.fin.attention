pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement  tianshi holdings agreed to buy all of the registered share capital of life resources for million 
on march   the chinese government approved the transfer of the shares of life resources  and tianshi holdings became the owner of life resources

we develop our products at our product research and development center  which employs highly qualified professionals in the fields of pharmacology  biology  chemistry and fine chemistry 
we have developed and produce nutrition supplement products  which include wellness products and dietary nutrition supplements

tianshi engineering  in turn  sells the products to customers through its branches and affiliated companies and at chain stores which are owned by individual distributors 
internationally  we sell our products to overseas affiliates who in turn re package the products to meet the needs of the local markets and sell to independent distributors who use the products themselves and or resell them to other distributors or consumers 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
in revenue was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the breakdown of revenue between chinese and international sales is as follows chinese and international revenue revenue region year year change china international we believe that our strong sales growth in china was due to increased marketing efforts during in addition  during the third quarter of  tianshi engineering announced plans to increase the prices of its products beginning in october we believe this announcement prompted customers to stock up on certain products 
the price increase of tianshi engineering products will not affect the price at which biological sells to tianshi engineering 
the application of tianshi engineering for a direct selling license in china is still pending 
until the application is approved  tianshi engineering will continue to sell our products through its branches  affiliated companies  and chain stores in china 
increased international sales reflect a sharp increase in sales to russia and indonesia during in addition  in august of  administration for quality supervision  inspection and quarantine aqsiq announced an ongoing national campaign in china against unsafe food and substandard products 
the special campaign against poor product quality was launched in response to a series safety scares involving chinese products worldwide 
the campaign set detailed goals  including twelve percents 
for example  percent of food producers should be licensed  percent of agricultural wholesale markets in cities must be monitored  percent of suppliers of raw materials for exported products should be inspected  and percent of agricultural products must be free of five types of strong pesticides 
as a result of this campaign by the aqsiq  there has been a general slow down and backlog of export clearances for chinese food products  and from august through the first quarter of  we experienced significant delays in obtaining export clearance for all of the products which we sell to our international affiliates 
beginning in the second quarter of  these export restrictions were reduced for exports to countries in africa and asia  but remained in place for exports to countries in europe and the americas 
during the last two quarters of  these export restrictions were further reduced  and the campaign ended at the end of cost of sales 
cost of sales were million in compared to million in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to the corresponding increase in sales revenue 
cost of sales increased at a higher rate than revenue because of increases in the costs of raw materials and packing materials  and an increase in the portion of the products we sold in bearing a higher cost of production  relative to our other products  than in gross profit 
gross profit increased by to million in  compared to million in the gross profit margin for was compared to in this decrease reflects an increase in the costs of raw materials and packing materials  and an increase in the portion of the products we sold in bearing a higher cost of production  relative to other products  than in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and insurance costs  allowance for bad debt  research and development  advertising expenses  and house reserve funds 
the selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in  because of the increase in sales 
other expense income  net 
other expense  net was million of expense in  compared to income of million in on january   the million loan to tianshi engineering became interest bearing 
in addition beginning in january  we adopted a policy pursuant to which accounts receivable relating to tianshi engineering older than days are transferred to other receivables related parties and become interest bearing 
in december tianshi engineering paid off the million loan in full 
no accounts receivable relating to tianshi engineering remained outstanding for more than days in net income 
for the above stated reasons  net income in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we have historically met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  including funding for expansion of operations  through net cash flow provided by operating activities 
our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the increase primarily reflects the increase in net income and the fact that in tianshi engineering paid us for products timely  while in tianshi engineering offset much of the amounts owed to us in purchase liabilities and other liabilities we owed tianshi engineering and its affiliates 
as of december   we had positive working capital of million 
cash was million as of december   compared to as of december  net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in in august  life resources paid rmb   in connection with the zoning changes to one parcel of land on which the land use rights was changed from industrial to educational 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  compared to million for in  life resources received million of capital contributions from tianshi investment 
accounts receivable related parties increased to million as of december  from million as of december  this is mainly due to the increase in sales in the fourth quarter of compared to that of other receivable related parties increased to million as of december  from million as of december  on december   biological entered a real property transfer agreement with tianshi group  pursuant to which biological transferred four buildings at the price of rmb  
as of december   tianshi group had not paid us for the property transfer 
going forward  our primary requirements for cash consist of construction by life resources of new research and development  manufacturing and logistic facilities  and administrative offices  the continued production of existing products and general overhead and personnel related expenses to support these activities  the development costs of new products  and expansion of production scale to meet the demands of our markets 
as of december   the majority of the main structures of the life resources facility construction project had been completed 
since september   the office buildings  warehouses  work plants  product exhibition center and dormitories have undergone internal decoration 
the cost of the completed work of these facilities is approximately  based on an exchange rate of rmb as of september   which includes amounts paid for the underlying land use rights 
the main structures of the quality control center  power center  boiler room and new main material center are expected be completed in the first half of and internal decoration is expected to be completed in the second half of as of the end of  the cost of the completed work of these facilities was  based on an exchange rate of rmb as of december   which includes amounts paid for the underlying land use right 
we expect that all construction work and equipment installation will be complete in and that the life resources facility will begin operations by the end of we have provided for an amount of up to  based on an exchange rate of rmb as of january  in its budget for capital expenditures on the life resources facility 
the wholly foreign owned enterprise law  as amended and the wholly foreign owned enterprise law implementing rules  as amended  contain the principal regulations governing dividend distributions by wholly foreign owned enterprises 
under these regulations  wholly foreign owned enterprises  such as biological and life resources  may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits  if any  determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations 
additionally  biological and life resources are required to set aside a certain amount of any accumulated profits each year a minimum of  and up to an aggregate amount equal to half of its registered capital  to fund certain reserve funds 
these reserves are not distributable as cash dividends  except in the event of liquidation  and cannot be used for working capital purposes 
the prc government also imposes controls on the conversion of rmb into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the prc 
we have not declared any dividends on our common stock since inception and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
if we ever determine to pay a dividend  we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of such dividends from the profits of biological and life resources 
we anticipate that our current operating activities will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements for off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition during  we sold both semi finished products and finished products to tianshi engineering domestically 
revenue from semi finished products was recognized at fob tianjin shipping point 
revenue from finished products was recognized only when the related party chinese distributors recognized sales of our products to unaffiliated third parties 
revenues in both cases are net of taxes 
for overseas sales  we only sell finished products 
we recognize revenue from international sales non chinese to affiliated parties  net of taxes as goods are shipped and clear review by the customs department of the chinese government 
we are generally not contractually obligated to accept returns 
however  on a case by case negotiated basis  we permit customers to return their products 
in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  revenue is recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns 
such reserves are based upon management s evaluation of historical experience and estimated costs 
the amount of the reserves ultimately required could differ materially in the near term from amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   tianshi engineering  an affiliated company  owned all of the related party distributors which sell our products in china 
allowance for doubtful accounts our trade accounts receivables are mainly due from related companies 
we have made full provision for accounts receivable related parties aging over one year and a general allowance for doubtful debts of of the remaining accounts receivable related parties 
management reviews its accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year end  paying particular attention to the age of receivable outstanding 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the moving average basis 
management reviews inventory annually for possible obsolete goods or to determine if any reserves are necessary for potential obsolescence

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effects of inflation we are subject to commodity price risks arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of the various raw materials that comprise our products 
price risks are managed by each business unit through productivity improvements and cost containment measures 
for the time being  the management does not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates our operating subsidiary  biological  is located in china  and buys all of its raw materials in china and sells our products in china using the renminbi as the functional currency 
based on chinese government regulations  all foreign currencies under the category of current accounts are allowed to be freely exchanged with hard currencies 
as of december   the exchange rate was rmb  compared to rmb as of december  substantially all our revenues and expenses are denominated in the renminbi 
however  we use the dollar for financial reporting purposes 
the value of renminbi against the dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
as our operations are primarily in china  any significant revaluation of the renminbi may materially and adversely affect our cash flows  revenues and financial condition 
for example  to the extent that we need to convert dollars into renminbi for our operations  appreciation of this currency against the dollar could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
conversely  if we decide to convert our renminbi into dollars for other business purposes and the dollar appreciates against this currency  the dollar equivalent of the renminbi would be reduced 
we are exposed to a foreign currency risk arising from the possibility that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could impact accounts receivable from our sales to overseas affiliate companies 
overseas affiliate companies pay for the products they purchase in us dollars  therefore  the main foreign currency risk is the fluctuation of the us dollar against other currencies 
in general  our payment term for accounts receivable is approximately days  during which period those overseas affiliate companies exchange their local currency for us dollars  and  when we collect the accounts receivable from them in us dollars  we exchange the us dollars for renminbi 
the collection and exchange of local currency may take overseas affiliates approximately days  almost one third of our payment term of days 
thus  we believe that overseas affiliates bear approximately of our exposure to us currency exchange rate fluctuations 
sales to overseas affiliates totaled million in  and the average balance of our renminbi denominated bank accounts was million 
our share in an adverse exchange rate swing of would amount to approximately million of the amount of sales to overseas affiliates and million of the amount of renminbi denominated bank accounts  which are insignificant in relation to our assets of million and shareholders equity of million as of december  the total amount of sales in was million  while the impact of fluctuation of foreign exchange rates would amount to approximately million  which is less than of the total sales in  and we believe it is immaterial 
therefore  the anticipated fluctuation of foreign exchange rates will not significantly impact our relative financial data 
currently we have not entered agreements or purchased instruments to hedge our exchange rate risks  although we may do so in the future
