our wintv pvr tv recording products include all of the basic features of our analog tv tuner products  such as tv on the pc screen  channel changing and volume adjustment 
they also add the ability to record tv shows to disk using a built in high quality hardware mpeg encoder 
this technology allows a typical desktop computer system to record up to hundreds of hours of video to disk  limited only by the size of the disk or storage medium 
in addition  the wintv pvr user can pause a live tv show  and then resume watching the tv show at a later time 
the maximum amount of recording time and the maximum amount of paused tv is dependent upon the hard disk space available on the pc 
the wintv pvr user can record a tv show to the hard disk using a tv scheduler and then play the recording back  edit it  and record the show onto a cd rom or dvd rom  using a cd or dvd writer  for playback on a home or portable dvd player or on a pc 
the user can re size the window during viewing  recording or playback

the xfone has the ability to broadcast to more than one headphone allowing multiple users to listen to the audio from their pc or mac 
technology analog tv technology we have developed four generations of products which convert analog video into digital video since our first such product was introduced in the first generation of wintv products put the tv image on the pc screen using chroma keying  requiring a dedicated feature connector cable between the wintv and the vga video board 
our initial customers were mostly professional pc users  such as financial market professionals who needed to be able to view stock market related tv shows while spending many hours on their pcs  who found having tv in a window on their desktop useful and entertaining 
in  we invented a technique called smartlock  which eliminated the need for the feature connector cable 
in  we introduced the wintv celebrity generation of tv tuner boards based on this smartlock technology  greatly improving customer satisfaction 
at the time  our cinemapro series of wintv boards then used smartlock and other techniques to further reduce cost and improve performance 
in june  we introduced the wintv pci line of tv tuner boards for pcs 
these boards were developed to eliminate the relatively expensive smartlock circuitry and memory used on the wintv celebrity and cinemapro products 
the wintv pci used a technique called pci push and was designed to be used in the then emerging intel pentium market 
these pentium based pcs had a new type of system expansion bus  called the pci bus  which allowed data to be moved at a much higher rate than the older isa bus  which the previous wintv generations used 
the pci push technique moves the video image times per second in europe the image is moved times per second over the pci bus 
in addition to being less expensive to manufacture  the wintv pci had higher digital video movie capture performance than the previous generations  capturing video at up to quarter screen frames per second 
with this higher performance capture capability  the wintv pci found new uses in video conferencing  video surveillance and internet streaming video applications 
the fourth generation analog tv tuners are the wintv pvr models which were first developed during fiscal and introduced to the market in early fiscal the wintv pvrs include both internal pci and external usb tv tuners which are designed to add the ability to record tv shows to a pc s hard disk 
the core technology in the wintv pvr products is a hardware mpeg encoder  which compresses analog video from a tv tuner or external video source into an mpeg format in real time 
mpeg is the compression format used on dvds and for the transmission of digital tv 
this mpeg encoder is a purchased chip  to which we add our driver and application software to create the recording and program pause functions 
our wintv application was enhanced to add the functions needed to record  pause and play back tv on a pc screen 
digital tv technology our wintv d board  developed during the fiscal year and delivered to the market in the beginning of fiscal  was the first atsc digital tv tuner for the north american market which allowed pcs to receive  display and record over the air digital tv signals 
atsc digital television is the digital tv standard for north america which has replaced analog television in the united states and canada 
in the us  all analog over the air television transmissions have ceased as of june  and only digital tv transmissions will be broadcast 
since our first atsc digital tv tuner delivered in  we have introduced new digital tv tuners for use in north america 
in fiscal  we also introduced the wintv dvb board for the european market 
this board brings european digital tv to pcs  and is based on the digital video broadcast standard 
both the wintv d and the wintv dvb have the ability to receive special data broadcasts which some broadcasters may send along with the digital tv signal  in addition to displaying digital tv in a resizable window 
data broadcasts on digital tv are transmitted at several million bits per second 
our proprietary software can decode and display some of these special data broadcasts 
we may work on standardized reception and display software  if such broadcasts become standardized 
the software to control the digital tv reception is based on our wintv software  which was developed during fiscal and has had a major update in and over the two fiscal years ended september   we have further developed the digital tv reception capabilities of our digital family of products and as of september  we have products for dvb t terrestrial  dvb s and dvb s satellite  atsc and clear qam digital tv reception 
in addition  there are seven pctv products which allow digital tv to be watched on a pc or notebook computer 
our mediamvp is a device which allows tv recordings which are stored on a pc or notebook computer to be viewed on a tv set 
based on the linux operating system  the mediamvp works in a client server system with a pc  communicating with the pc server and receiving digital media from the pc and displaying the media on the tv set 
the core technology to the mediamvp comprises the configuration and enhancements to the linux operating system  the user interface displayed on the tv set  and the technology to transmit digital media reliably over the local area network 
the mediamvp is available in a wired or wireless version 
research and development our development efforts are focused on extending the range and features of our existing products and developing additional internal and externally attached tv tuner products 
we intend to develop more highly integrated versions of hardware products to further improve performance and price points  and new versions of software to add features  improve ease of use  and provide support for new operating systems 
as of september   we had three research and development operations one based in our hauppauge  new york headquarters  one based in taipei  taiwan  roc and one in braunschweig  germany 
the new york and taiwan r d operations are aimed at extending the range and features of our digital analog products  developing additional externally attached tv products  additional high definition digital tv products and portable digital players 
the braunschweig  germany pctv research and engineering facility is responsible for the updating and enhancement of the current pctv line in addition to developing new pctv products 
the technology underlying our products and certain other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products and technologies  which may have a material adverse impact upon our business 
see  item a risk factors 
we maintain an ongoing research and development program 
our future success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in part  on our ability to respond quickly to technological advances by developing and introducing new products  successfully incorporating such advances in existing products  and obtaining licenses  patents  or other proprietary technologies to be used in connection with new or existing products 
we continue to invest in research and development 
we spent approximately  and  for research and development expenses for the years ended september  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our current and future research and development will be successful or that we will be able to foresee  and respond to  advances in technological developments and to successfully develop other products 
additionally  there can be no assurances that the development of technologies and products by competitors will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
see item a risk factors 
production and suppliers we design the hardware for most models of the wintv  pctv and mediamvp products  and also write the operating software to be used in conjunction with many versions of the microsoft windows operating system  including windows and windows vista 
during fiscal  we sub contracted the manufacturing and assembly of most of these products to six independent third parties at facilities in various asian countries 
we monitor and test the quality of the completed products at any one of our facilities in the us hauppauge  new york  singapore or ireland before packaging the products and shipping them to our customers 
we also buy some models of tv tuner products  such as the wintv nova t  some models of wintv hvr  wintv ci module and xfones from other unrelated third party companies  add hauppauge software and sell under our name or on a private label basis 
most of the pctv products sold by hauppauge in were manufactured and assembled by avid prior to the pctv acquisition 
they are provided to hauppauge by avid as part of the pctv inventory and product return agreement 
see item acquisition of pctv assets from avid technology  inc of the pctv products not provided by avid  we sub contracted the manufacturing and assembly to two independent third parties 
these two contract manufacturers  both located in asia  were previous used by avid for the manufacturing of pctv products 
certain component parts  such as tv tuners  video decoder chips and software compression chips  plus certain assembled products  such as the wintv hvr stick products that are essential to our business  are available from a single source or limited sources 
other essential component parts that are generally available from multiple sources may be obtained by us from only a single source or limited sources because of pricing concerns 
see item a risk factors 
components are subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures 
any availability limitations  interruption in supplies  or price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our new products may initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source 
see item a risk factors 
we typically attempt to evaluate and qualify additional suppliers for these components 
where a product utilizes a new component  initial capacity constraints of the supplier of that component may exist until such time as the supplier s yields have matured 
components are normally acquired through purchase orders  either issued by us or by our contract manufacturers  typically covering our requirements for a day period from the date of issue 
purchased assembled products are normally covered by longer term purchase orders 
our principal suppliers of component parts are dibcom sa  nxp semiconductors and conexant systems 
if the supply of a key component  or a purchased assembled product  were to be delayed or curtailed  or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipment of completed products to us or our contract manufacturer  our ability to ship products in desired quantities  and in a timely manner  will be adversely affected 
our business  operating results and financial condition will likely be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 
see item a risk factors 
we attempt to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with our key suppliers on product introduction plans  strategic inventories  coordinated product introductions  and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels 
we have  from time to time  experienced significant price increases and limited availability of certain components 
similar occurrences in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
see item a risk factors 
during fiscal and  all wintv  pctv and mediamvp manufacturing was performed by six unrelated contract manufacturers in asia 
product design specifications are provided by our engineering team to ensure proper assembly 
contract manufacturing is primarily done on a consignment basis  in which we provide all the significant component parts and we pay for assembly charges and for certain additional parts for each board produced 
some products are purchased on a turnkey basis  in which all components and labor are provided by the manufacturer  and the manufacturing price includes parts and assembly costs 
we monitor the quality of the finished product produced by our contract manufacturers 
as of september   we had six qualified contract manufacturers located in malaysia  indonesia  taiwan and china  who are capable of producing our products to our standards 
if demand were to increase dramatically  we believe additional production could be absorbed by these qualified contract manufacturers 
for fiscal and we did not engage any contract manufacturers in europe or north america 
customer service and technical support we maintain customer service and technical support departments in our hauppauge  new york headquarters  as well as in the uk  germany  france  italy  scandinavia  taiwan and in singapore 
technical support is provided to help with installation problems or pre sale and post sale questions on our products  while customer service provides repair service in accordance with our warranty policy free of charge for product that is within the warranty period 
during fiscal customer support and technical support for pctv products was absorbed into the existing hauppauge customer support and technical support infrastructure 
customers and markets we primarily market our products to the personal computer market  including both microsoft windows and apple macintosh based systems 
to reach this market  we sell to a network of computer retailers in the us  europe and asia and through computer products distributors and manufacturers 
to attract new users to our products  from time to time we run special promotions and participate in cooperative advertising with computer retailers 
we actively participate in trade shows to educate and train key computer retail marketing personnel 
most of our sales and marketing budget is aimed at the consumer market 
apart from the typical home user  we also target business users 
one example of a business application is in the securities brokerage industry where our product is primarily used to display financial tv shows in a window on a broker s pc screen while the pc continues to receive financial information 
we have sold our wintv products on a direct corporate sales basis to two large financial services information providers for incorporation into their workstations  and several independent financial institutions 
this market segment is typically project based 
we also offer our products to pc manufacturers that either embed a wintv product in a pc that they sell  or sell the wintv as an accessory to the pc 
sales channels for our products we primarily sell through a sales channel which consist of retailers  pc manufacturers and distributors 
we have no exclusive distributors and retailers 
for fiscal  we had one customer  d h distributing  that accounted for approximately of our net sales 
for fiscal  we had one customer  hon hai precision industry co 
ltd  that accounted for approximately of our sales 
our pctv products are offered as our high end line and are sold through similar retail and distribution channels as our wintv products 
marketing and sales we market our products both domestically and internationally through our sales offices in the us new york and california  germany  the united kingdom  france  taiwan and singapore  plus through independent sales representative offices in the netherlands  spain  scandinavia  poland and italy 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  approximately of our net sales were made within the us  while approximately were made outside the united states 
more information on our geographic segments can be obtained from item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements which comprise part of this annual report on form k 
from time to time  we advertise our products in a number of consumer computer magazines 
we also participate in retailers market promotion programs  such as store circulars and promotions and retail store displays 
these in store promotional programs  magazine advertisements  plus a public relations program aimed at editors of key pc computer magazines and an active website on the internet  are the principal means of getting our product introduced to end users 
our sales in computer retail stores are closely related to the effectiveness of these programs  along with the technical capabilities of the products 
we also list our products in catalogs of various mail order companies and attend trade shows 
we intend to absorb the marketing and sales of our pctv line into our existing sales and marketing structure 
it is anticipated that our existing sales personnel will handle the generating of sales orders and the pctv line will follow marketing and advertising programs that are similar to our wintv programs 
we currently have fifteen sales people located in europe  two sales people in the far east and two sales people in the us  located in new york and california 
in addition to our sales people we also utilize the services of manufacturer representatives in the united states and manufacturer representatives in europe 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with reference to a discussion on the impact seasonality has on our sales 
foreign currency fluctuations for each of the fiscal years ended september  and  at least of our sales were generated by our european subsidiary and were invoiced and collected in local currency  which is primarily the euro 
on the supply side  since we predominantly deal with north american and asian suppliers and contract manufacturers  approximately of the our inventory required to support our european sales is purchased and paid in us dollars 
the combination of sales billed in euros supported by inventory purchased in us dollars results in an absence of a natural local currency hedge 
consequently  our financial results are subject to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rates 
see item a risk factors and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition our business is subject to significant competition 
competition exists from larger companies that possess substantially greater technical  financial  human  sales and marketing resources than we do 
the dynamics of competition in this market involve short product life cycles  declining selling prices  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
we compete against companies such as ati technologies inc  a division of advanced micro devices  inc 
and a number of asian and european companies 
our mediamvp product competes in the consumer electronics market  where competition comes from sony corporation  toshiba corporation  cisco systems  inc and others 
we believe that competition from new entrants into our market will increase as the market for television in a pc expands 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition in the future 
such increased competition may have a material adverse affect on our ability to successfully market our products 
competition is expected to remain intense and  as a result  we may lose some of our market share to our competitors 
further  we believe that the market for our products will continue to be price competitive and thus we could continue to experience lower selling prices  lower gross profit margins and reduced profitability levels for such products than in the past 
item a risk factors 
though management believes that the delivery of tv via the internet will become more popular in the future  we believe that tv delivered via cable  broadcast or satellite will continue to dominate the way consumers watch live television 
since our products connect directly to cable  broadcast and satellite tuners  we view our products as the preferred way to watch and record tv on the pc 
patents  copyrights and trademarks with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology  there is a significant volume of patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties with regard to our market 
there are a number of companies that hold patents for various aspects of the technologies incorporated in some of the pc and tv industries standards 
given the nature of our products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties against us 
we expect that parties seeking to gain competitive advantages will increase their efforts to enforce any patent or intellectual property rights that they may have 
the holders of patents from which we may have not obtained licenses may take the position that we are required to obtain a license from them 
if a patent holder refuses to offer such a license or offers such a license on terms unacceptable to us  there is a risk of incurring substantial litigation or settlement costs regardless of the merits of the allegations or which party eventually prevails 
if we do not prevail in a litigation suit  we may be required to pay significant damages and or cease sales and production of infringing products and accordingly  may incur significant defense costs 
additionally  we may need to attempt to design around a given technology  although there can be no assurances that this would be possible or economical 
we currently use technology licensed from third parties in certain products 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to these third party technologies  including failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the technology delays in shipment of products excess customer support or product return costs due to problems with licensed technology and termination of our relationship with such licensors we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and other means of protection 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technological advantage we may have 
due to the rapid pace of technological change  we believe our success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of our proprietary rights 
however  we intend to aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary 
even though we independently develop most of our products and copyright the operating software which our products use  our success will depend  in a large part  on our ability to innovate  obtain or license patents  protect trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others

item a 
risk factors our operating results and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  that could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  any of which could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our business  operating results and financial condition  past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends for future periods 
if tv technology for the pc  or our implementation of this technology  is not accepted  we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 
our future success depends on the growing use and acceptance of tv and video applications for pcs 
the market for these applications is still evolving  and may not develop to the extent necessary to enable us to further expand our business 
we have invested  and continue to invest  significant time and resources in the development of new products for this market 
our dependence on sales of tv and video products for the pc lack of market diversification concentration on the north american and european market for the majority of our sales potential inability to remain ahead of the development of competing technologies could each have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition if we are unable to address any of the factors listed above 
we rely upon sales of a small number of product lines  and the failure of any one product line to be successful in the market could substantially reduce our sales 
we currently rely upon sales from our existing product lines of internal and external products to generate a majority of our sales 
while we continue to develop additional products within these and other product lines  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
consequently  if the existing or future products are not successful  sales could decline substantially  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we rely heavily on the success of retailers  dealers and pc manufacturers to market  sell and distribute our products 
if these channels are not effective in distributing our products  our sales could be reduced 
these retailers  dealers and pc manufacturers may not effectively promote or market our products or they may experience financial difficulties and even close operations 
our sales channels are not contractually obligated to sell our products  and they typically sell on an as needed basis 
therefore  they may  at any time refuse to promote our products discontinue the use of our products in favor of a competitor s product also  with a distribution channel standing between us and the actual end user  we may not be able to accurately gauge current demand and anticipate future demand for our products 
for example  retailers  dealers and pc manufacturers may place large initial orders for a new product just to keep their stores and products stocked with the newest tv tuners and not because there is a significant demand for them 
we operate in a highly competitive market  and many of our competitors have much greater resources  which may make it difficult for us to remain competitive 
our business is subject to significant competition 
competition exists from larger companies that possess substantially greater technical  financial  human  sales and marketing resources than we do 
the dynamics of competition in this market involve short product life cycles  declining selling prices  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
we compete against companies such as ati technologies inc  a division of advanced micro devices  inc  and a number of asian and european companies 
our mediamvp product competes in the consumer electronics market  where competition comes from sony corporation  toshiba corporation  cisco systems  inc and others 
we believe that competition from new entrants will increase as the market for digital video in a pc expands 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience increased competition in the future 
such increased competition may have a material adverse affect on our ability to successfully market our products 
competition is expected to remain intense and  as a result  we may lose some of our market share to our competitors 
further  we believe that the market for our products will continue to be price competitive and thus we could continue to experience lower selling prices  lower gross profit margins and reduced profitability levels for such products than in the past 
rapid technological changes and short product life cycles in our industry and the availability of new products  services and technologies could harm our business 
the technology underlying our products and other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products  services and technologies  which may have a material adverse impact upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
the pervasive availability of new products  services including internet services and technologies may have a material adverse impact upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
we will need to maintain an ongoing research and development program  and our potential future success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in part  on our ability to respond quickly to technological advances by developing and introducing new products  successfully incorporating such advances in existing products  and obtaining licenses  patents  or other proprietary technologies to be used in connection with new or existing products 
we expended approximately  and  for research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will be successful or that we will be able to foresee and respond to such advances in technological developments and to successfully develop additional products 
additionally  there can be no assurances that the development of technologies  services or products by competitors will not render our products or technologies non competitive or obsolete 
if tv or video capabilities are included in pcs or in operating systems  it could result in a reduction in the demand for add on tv and video devices 
although we believe that our software is a competitive strength  as operating systems such as windows move to integrate and standardize software support for video capabilities  we will be challenged to further differentiate our products 
our operating results and ability to retain our market share are also dependent on continued growth in the underlying markets for pc  tv and video products 
we may not be able to timely adopt emerging industry standards  which may make our products unacceptable to potential customers  delay our product introductions or increase our costs 
our products must comply with a number of current industry standards and practices established by various international bodies 
failure to comply with evolving standards  including video compression standards  tv transmission standards  and pc interface standards  will limit acceptance of our products by the market 
if new standards are adopted in the industry  we will be required to adopt those standards in our products 
it may take a significant amount of time to develop and design products incorporating these new standards  and we may not succeed in doing so 
we may also become dependent upon products developed by third parties and have to pay royalty fees  which may be substantial  to the developers of the technology that constitutes the newly adopted standards 
we are dependent upon foreign markets for sales of our products  primarily the european market  and adverse changes in these markets could reduce our sales 
our future performance will likely be dependent  in large part  on our ability to continue to compete successfully in the european markets  where a large portion of our current and potential customers are located 
our ability to compete in these markets will depend on many factors  including the economic conditions in these regions the value of the euro versus the us dollar the stability of the political environment in these regions adverse changes in the relationships between major countries in these regions the state of trade relations among these regions and the united states restrictions on trade in these regions the imposition or changing of tariffs by the countries in these regions on products of the type that we sell changes in the regulatory environment in these regions export restrictions and export license requirements restrictions on the export of critical technology our ability to develop pc tv products that meet the varied technical requirements of customers in each of these regions our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with our foreign customers and distributors changes in freight rates our ability to enforce agreements and other rights in the countries in these regions difficulties in staffing and managing international operations difficulties assessing new and existing international markets and credit risks potential insolvency of international customers and difficulty in collecting accounts if we are unable to address any of these factors  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are heavily dependent upon foreign manufacturing facilities for our products  primarily facilities in asia  which exposes us to additional risks 
the majority of our products are built at contract manufacturing facilities in asia 
our ability to successfully build products at overseas locations will depend on many factors  including the economic conditions in these regions the acceptance of the us dollar as the currency to purchase manufactured products the stability of the political environment in these regions adverse changes in the relationships between major countries in these regions the state of trade relations among these regions and the united states restrictions on trade in these regions the imposition or changing of tariffs by the countries in these regions on products of the type that we sell changes in the regulatory environment in these regions import restrictions and import license requirements our ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with our foreign manufacturers changes in freight rates difficulties in staffing and managing international operations potential insolvency of vendors and difficulty in obtaining materials if we are unable to address any of these factors  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
foreign currency exchange fluctuations could adversely affect our results 
for the two fiscal years ended september  and  at least of our sales were generated by our european subsidiary and were invoiced and collected in local currency  which was primarily the euro 
on the supply side  since we predominantly deal with north american and asian suppliers and contract manufacturers  approximately of our inventory required to support our european sales are purchased and paid in us dollars 
the combination of sales billed in euros supported by inventory purchased in us dollars results in an absence of a natural local currency hedge 
consequently  our financial results are subject to market risks resulting from the fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rates 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to develop new products that meet customer requirements in a timely manner 
our success is dependent on our ability to continue to introduce new products with advanced features  functionality and performance that our customers demand 
we may not be able to introduce new products on a timely basis  that are accepted by the market  and that sell in quantities sufficient to make the products viable for the long term 
sales of new products may negatively impact sales of existing products 
in addition  we may have difficulty establishing our products presence in markets where they do not currently have significant brand recognition 
we may experience declining margins 
for several years we have experienced declining gross margins due to the following factors  among others larger sales mix of lower margin products changes in foreign currency exchange rates allowances for excess inventory increases in costs charged by contract manufacturers increases in duty and tariff rates increases in shipping costs lower average selling prices increases in material acquisition costs and different gross margins for like products in different markets consequently  as margins may decline  our profitability will be more dependent upon effective cost management controls 
there can be no assurances that such cost and management controls can be implemented and maintained  and if implemented  that they will be successful 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  downward pricing pressure on our products  which could substantially impair our operating performance 
we are experiencing  and are likely to continue to experience  downward pricing pressure on our products 
as a result  we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  declining average sales prices for our products 
increases in the number of units that we are able to sell and reductions in per unit costs may not occur  and if they occur  they may not be sufficient to offset reductions in per unit sales prices  in which case our net income would be reduced and we could incur losses 
since we typically negotiate supply arrangements far in advance of delivery dates  we may need to commit to price reductions for our products before we are aware of how  or if  these cost reductions can be obtained 
as a result  any current or future price reduction commitments and our inability to respond to increased price competition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our cost reduction and operational efficiency programs may not achieve the intended results changing economic and business conditions may dictate that we undertake a plan of cost and operational efficiency reductions 
we cannot be certain that these programs will achieve their intended results 
additionally  these programs may be misplaced or insufficient for purposes of positioning us for future growth  in which case our long term competitive position may suffer 
failure of these programs  if any  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon contract manufacturers for our production 
if these manufacturers do not meet our requirements  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
during fiscal  we subcontracted the manufacturing and assembly of our products to six independent third parties at facilities in various asian countries 
relying on subcontractors involves a number of significant risks  including loss of control over the manufacturing process potential absence of adequate production capacity potential delays in production lead times unavailability of certain process technologies reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs  and unexpected increases in component costs we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential manufacturing disruptions 
if our significant subcontractors become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture these products in required volumes  we will have to identify qualified alternate subcontractors 
additional qualified subcontractors may not be available  or may not be available on a timely or cost competitive basis 
any interruption in the supply of  or increase in the cost of  the products manufactured by third party subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are dependent upon single or limited source suppliers for our components and assembled products 
if these suppliers do not meet the demand  either in volume or quality  then we could be materially harmed 
if the supply of a key component or assembled product  such as the wintv hvr  the wintv nova t stick or a pctv product  were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing or sole vendor delays shipment of such components or completed products  our ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner would be adversely affected 
our business  operating results and financial condition could also be adversely affected  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or  if possible  to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source 
we attempt to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with our key suppliers on product introduction plans  strategic inventories  coordinated product introductions  and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels 
we are also seeking out alternative sources for assembled products  making us less dependent on a single or limited source 
we may need to hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential component shortages or discontinuation 
this could lead to an increase in the costs of manufacturing or assembling our products 
if any single or limited source supplier becomes unable or unwilling to continue to supply these components or assembled products in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements or redesign our products with different components 
additional sources may not be available  or product redesign may not be feasible on a timely basis 
any interruption in the supply of or increase in the cost of the components and assembled products provided by single or limited source suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may incur excessive expenses if we are unable to accurately forecast sales of our products 
we generally ship products within one to four weeks after receipt of orders 
therefore  our sales backlog is typically minimal 
accordingly  our expectations of future net sales and our product manufacturing and materials planning are based largely on our own estimates of future demand and not on firm customer orders 
if we obtain orders in excess of our internal forecasts  we may be unable to timely increase production to meet demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
if our net sales do not meet expectations  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected  we may be burdened with excess inventory  and we may be subject to excess costs or inventory write offs 
we may experience a reduction in sales if we are unable to respond quickly to changes in the market for our products 
our net sales can be affected by changes in the quantity of products that our retail  distributor and pc manufacturer customers maintain in their inventories 
we may be directly and rapidly affected by changes in the market  including the impact of any slowdown or rapid increase in end user demand 
despite efforts to reduce distribution channel inventory exposure  retailers  distribution partners and pc manufacturer customers may still choose to alter their inventory levels  which could cause a reduction in our net sales  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may accumulate inventory to minimize the impact of shortages from manufacturers and suppliers  which may result in obsolete inventory that we may need to write off resulting in losses 
managing our inventory is complicated by fluctuations in the demand for our products as well as the issues of using contract manufacturers and procuring components from suppliers mentioned above 
as we must plan to have sufficient quantities of products available to satisfy our customers demands  we sometimes accumulate inventory for a period of time to minimize the impact of possible insufficient capacity or availability of components from our manufacturers and suppliers 
although we expect to sell the inventory within a short period of time  products may remain in inventory for extended periods of time and may become obsolete because of the passage of time and the introduction of new products or new components within existing products 
in these situations  we would be required to write off obsolete inventory which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need financing  and may not be able to raise financing on favorable terms  if at all  which could increase our costs and limit our ability to grow and operate 
we anticipate that we may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue our long term expansion plans  to respond to competitive pressures or to respond to unanticipated requirements 
on march   our line of credit with the jp morgan chase bank expired and was not renewed 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our failure or inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms could require us to limit our plans for expansion  incur indebtedness that has high rates of interest or substantial restrictive covenants  issue equity securities that will dilute existing stockholders holdings or discontinue a portion of our operations  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become involved in costly intellectual property disputes 
with the proliferation of new products and rapidly changing technology  there is a significant volume of patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
there are a number of companies that hold patents for various aspects of the technologies incorporated in some of the pc and tv industries standards 
given the nature of our products and development efforts  there are risks that claims associated with such patents or intellectual property rights could be asserted by third parties against us 
we expect that parties seeking to gain competitive advantages will increase their efforts to enforce any patent or intellectual property rights that they may have 
the holders of patents from which we may have not obtained licenses may take the position that it is required to obtain a license from them 
if a patent holder refuses to offer such a license or offers such a license on terms unacceptable to us  there is a risk of incurring substantial litigation or settlement costs regardless of the merits of the allegations  or which party eventually prevails 
if we do not prevail in a litigation suit  we may be required to pay significant damages and or to cease sales and production of infringing products and accordingly  may incur significant defense costs 
additionally  we may need to attempt to design around a given technology  although there can be no assurances that this would be possible or economical 
we currently use technology licensed from third parties in certain products 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to these third party technologies  including failure by a licensor to accurately develop  timely introduce  promote or support the technology delays in shipment of products excess customer support or product return costs due to problems with licensed technology termination of our relationship with such licensors we may be unable to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property through patent  copyright  trademark and other means of protection 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate our technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technological advantage we may have 
due to the rapid pace of technological change  we believe our success is likely to depend more upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and service rather than upon legal protection of our proprietary rights 
however  we intend to aggressively assert our intellectual property rights when necessary 
even though we typically develop our products independently  our success  of which there can be no assurances  will depend  in a large part  on our ability to innovate  obtain or license patents  protect trade secrets  copyrights and trademarks  and draw upon our proprietary technology without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we maintain copyrights on our designs and software programs  but currently we have no patent on the wintv board as we believe that such technology cannot be patented 
we have no patents issued or pending that relate to our technology 
we are subject to a number of risks relating to intellectual property rights  including the following the means by which we seek to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent others from misappropriating our technology or from independently developing or selling technology or products with features based on or similar to our products our products may be sold in foreign countries that provide less protection to intellectual property than is provided under us laws our intellectual property rights may be challenged  invalidated  violated or circumvented and may not provide us with any competitive advantage we may not be able to attract and retain qualified managerial and other skilled personnel 
our success  of which there can be no assurances  depends  in part  on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managerial  technical and sales personnel 
our success  of which there can be no assurances  is dependent on our ability to manage effectively the enhancement and introduction of existing and new products and the marketing of such products 
we are particularly dependent on our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified managers  engineers and salespersons 
the loss of the services of a significant number of engineers or sales people or one or more senior officers or managers could be disruptive to product development efforts or business relationships and could seriously harm our business 
we depend on a limited number of key personnel  and the loss of any of their services could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could substantially interfere with our operations 
our products are complex and our market is evolving 
the success of our business depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key officers or employees could adversely affect our future growth and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our dependence upon our key officers and employees is increased by the fact that they are responsible for our sales and marketing efforts as well as our overall operations 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than mr 
plotkin  our president  chairman of the board  chief executive officer and chief operating officer 
the insurance coverage that we have on him may be insufficient to compensate us for the loss of his services 
we may not be able to effectively integrate businesses or assets that we acquire 
we may identify and pursue acquisitions of complementary companies and strategic assets  such as customer bases  products and technology 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities 
if any such opportunity involves the acquisition of a business  we cannot be certain that we will successfully integrate the operations of the acquired business with our own all the benefits expected from such integration will be realized management s attention will not be diverted or divided  to the detriment of current operations amortization of acquired intangible assets will not have a negative effect on operating results or other aspects of our business delays or unexpected costs related to the acquisition will not have a detrimental effect on our business  operating results and financial condition customer dissatisfaction with  or performance problems at  an acquired company will not have an adverse effect on our reputation respective operations  management and personnel will be compatible in most cases  acquisitions will be consummated without seeking and obtaining stockholder approval  in which case stockholders will not have an opportunity to consider and vote upon the merits of such an acquisition 
although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular acquisition  there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess such risks 
our products could contain defects  which could result in delays in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  or failure to achieve market acceptance  or claims against us 
we develop complex products for tv and video processing 
despite testing by our engineers  subcontractors and customers  errors may be found in existing or future products 
this could result in  among other things  a delay in recognition of sales  loss of sales  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance or substantial damage to our reputation 
we could be subject to material claims by customers  and may need to incur substantial expenses to correct any product defects 
we do not have product liability insurance to protect against losses caused by defects in our products  and we also do not have errors and omissions insurance 
as a result  any payments that we may need to make to satisfy our customers may be substantial and may result in a substantial charge to earnings 
we may experience fluctuations in our future operating results  which will make predicting our future results difficult 
historically  our quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly from period to period  and we expect that our results will continue to do so 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including market acceptance of our products changes in order flow from our customers  and their inability to forecast their needs accurately the timing of our new product announcements and of announcements by our competitors increased competition  including changes in pricing by us and our competitors delays in deliveries from our limited number of suppliers and subcontractors difficulty in implementing effective cost management constraints  and market and economic conditions as our sales are primarily to the consumer market  we have experienced certain seasonal revenue trends 
our peak sales quarter  due to holiday season sales of computer equipment  is typically our first fiscal quarter october to december  followed by our second fiscal quarter january to march 
in addition  our international sales  mostly in the european market  were of sales for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
our fiscal fourth quarter sales july to september can be potentially impacted by the reduction of activity experienced in europe during the july and august summer holiday period 
accordingly  any sales or net income in any particular period may be lower than the sales and net income in a preceding or comparable period 
period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in future periods 
failure to meet such expectations  should such an event occur  will likely cause our share price to decline 
our common stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to a high degree of volatility 
numerous factors may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including general conditions in the pc and tv industries product pricing new product introductions market growth forecasts technological innovations mergers and acquisitions announcements of quarterly operating results overall us and international economic and market conditions and economic health stability of the us and international securities markets in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility and broad market fluctuations in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of securities issued by many high technology companies in many cases for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
the price of our common stock has experienced volatility not necessarily related to our performance 
we may not be able to maintain compliance with the requirements under the nasdaq listing rules or we may not be able to maintain our nasdaq listing 
on october   nasdaq notified us that we were subject to delisting based on our failure to timely hold our annual meeting 
in accordance with nasdaq s listing rules  we requested a hearing before a nasdaq hearings panel 
on november   we appeared before the panel and presented our plan to regain compliance 
on december   we held our annual meeting and on december   the panel rendered its determination to continue our listing 
the decision of the panel is subject to review by the nasdaq listing and review council within days following the issuance of the panel s written decision 
on november   we received a letter from nasdaq indicating that we are not in compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price rule 
the letter noted that  for the thirty consecutive trading days prior to november   our minimum closing bid price per share had been below the minimum bid price requirement set forth in nasdaq rule a 
in accordance with nasdaq rule c a  we have days  or until may   to regain compliance 
in its notice  nasdaq indicated that  if at any time during this period the minimum closing bid price is or more per share for at least ten consecutive trading days  nasdaq will provide confirmation that we have regained compliance 
should we fail to regain compliance by may   nasdaq has advised it will then provide a notice to us that our common stock will be delisted 
however  we may be eligible for an additional grace period if we satisfy all the requirements  other than the minimum bid price requirement  for initial listing on the nasdaq capital market  set forth in nasdaq listing rule in order to take advantage of this alternative we will need to submit an application to transfer our securities to the nasdaq capital market 
no assurances can be provided that we will be able to achieve or maintain compliance with the requirements under the nasdaq continued listing rules or standards including the minimum bid price rule or that we will maintain our nasdaq listing 
we may not be able to maintain our listing on the nasdaq global market or be eligible to for admittance on the nasdaq capital market 
if our securities are delisted by nasdaq  then the market liquidity for such securities would likely be negatively affected  which may make it more difficult for holders to sell such securities in the open market  and we could face additional difficulty raising capital necessary for our continued operation 
investors may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our securities 
our amended and restated by laws and the rights agreement to which we are party may have anti takeover effects  limiting the ability of outside stockholders to seek control of management  and any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be delayed 
effective august   the board of directors unanimously approved amended and restated by laws for us the by laws 
the by laws do not permit stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and consequently  an expensive proxy contest cannot occur other than in connection with the annual meeting of stockholders 
the by laws also impose strict requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of prospective board members other than those nominated by or at the discretion of the board of directors 
these amendments may collectively or individually impact a person s decision to purchase voting securities in our company and may have anti takeover effects in that any merger or takeover may be delayed 
accordingly  any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced 
on july   the board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on august  each right entitles the registered holder to purchase from us one common share at a purchase price of per share  subject to adjustment and terms set out in the rights agreement between us and continental stock transfer trust company  as rights agent 
the rights may have certain anti takeover effects 
the rights will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us in a manner which causes the rights to become discount rights unless the offer is conditional on a substantial number of rights being acquired 
accordingly  any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced 
we have paid no dividends and none are anticipated 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not contemplate or anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
it is currently anticipated that earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of the business 
in addition  the note contains restrictions on the payment of dividends  among other things

sales were impacted negatively by the closing of circuit city  the lack of consumer demand due to the weak global economic conditions and a weaker euro exchange rate 
seasonal nature of sales as the chart above indicates  there is a seasonal pattern to our quarterly sales 
listed below are the primary causes of our seasonal sales we primarily sell through a sales channel which consists of retailers  pc manufacturers and distributors 
spurred on by holiday spending  our sales during our first fiscal quarter  which encompasses the holiday season  have historically been the highest of our fiscal year 
for each of the fiscal years ended september  and at least of our sales were generated by our european subsidiary 
we typically experience a slowdown due to the summer holiday period in europe starting with the second half of our fiscal third quarter and into the first half of our fiscal fourth quarter 
we also experience decreased sales in the u 
s during the summer holiday months 
this has historically caused sales for the last six months of our fiscal year to be lower than the first six months of our fiscal year 
as the chart above indicates  our sales for the first six months of fiscal and fiscal accounted for and of sales  respectively  and our sales for the last six months of fiscal and accounted for and of sales  respectively 
although our strategy has been to diversify our sales to minimize the seasonal nature of our business  we anticipate similar seasonal trends for the near term future 
gross profit gross profit decreased  for the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  the decrease in the gross profit is detailed below increase decrease decrease in sales reduction in gross profit due lower euro exchange rate higher gross profit on sales mix lower production and production related costs total decrease in gross profit gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended september  was compared to for the twelve months ended september   an increase of 
the increase in the gross profit percentage is detailed below increase decrease higher gross profit on sales mix reduction in gross profit due lower euro exchange rate higher production and production related costs as a percentage of sales net increase in gross profit percentage the increase in the gross profit percentage for the twelve months ended september  compared to the twelve months ended september  was primarily due to favorable changes in the product sales mix  price increases and the addition of the pctv product line resulted in an increase in the gross profit percentage over fiscal of 
due to the decrease in sales  certain fixed and semi fixed expenses  such as building overhead  production labor and shipping labor increased as a percentage of sales  causing a decrease in gross profit percentage of compared to fiscal a decrease in the average euro to usd rate from for fiscal to for fiscal caused a decrease in the gross profit percentage of compared to fiscal volatility of gross profit percentage the chart above indicates the quarterly fluctuations in gross profit percentage 
over the eight quarters ended with the fourth quarter of fiscal  the gross profit percentage has ranged from a low of to a high of 
factors affecting the volatility of our gross profit percentages are mix of gross profit percentages gross profit percentages vary within our retail family of products as well as for products sold to manufacturers 
varying sales mix of these product lines affects the quarterly gross profit percentage 
fluctuating quarterly sales caused by seasonal trends included in cost of sales are certain fixed costs  mainly for production labor  warehouse labor and the overhead cost of our ireland distribution facility 
when unit and dollar sales decline due to seasonal sales trends  these fixed costs get spread over lower unit and dollar sales  which increases the product unit costs  increases the fixed costs as a percentage of sales and lowers the gross profit percentage 
competitive pressures our market is constantly changing with new competitors joining our established competitors 
these competitive pressures from time to time result in a lowering of our average sales prices to meet our competitors prices which tends to reduce gross profit percentage 
supply of component parts in times when component parts are in short supply we have to manage price increases 
conversely  when component parts supply is high we may be able to secure price decreases 
sales volume as unit sales volume increases we have more leverage in negotiating volume price decreases with our component suppliers and our contract manufacturers 
cost reductions we evaluate the pricing we receive from our suppliers and our contract manufacturers and we often seek to achieve component part and contract manufacturer cost reductions 
mix of sales that impacts the our obligation to pay certain licensing costs 
volatility of fuel prices increases in fuel costs are reflected in the amounts we pay for the delivery of product from our suppliers and the amounts we pay for deliveries to our customers 
therefore  rising fuel prices increase our freight costs and negatively impact our gross profit 
volatility of euro to us dollar exchange rate 
with over of our sales denominated in euros  changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rate impact gross profit 
an increase in the euro tends to increase our gross profit percentage  while a decrease in the euro tends to decrease our gross profit percentage 
managing product mix through market strategy and new products  moderating seasonal trends  efficiently managing shipments and achieving cost reductions are a company priority and are critical to our competitive position in the market 
although our goal is to optimize gross profit and minimize gross profit fluctuations  in light of the dynamics of our market we anticipate the continuance of gross profit percentage fluctuations 
selling  general and administrative expenses the chart below illustrates the components of selling  general and administrative expenses 
twelve months ended september  dollar costs percentage of sales increase decrease increase sales marketing hcw sales marketing pctv technical support general administrative hcw general administrative pctv amortization of intangible assets selling  general and administrative stock compensation expense total selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense decreased  from the prior fiscal year as follows 
excluding the pctv expenses and amortization of intangible assets acquired in the pctv acquisition  selling  general and administrative expense decreased  from the prior fiscal year 
sales and marketing expense for hcw decreased  primarily driven by the decrease in the euro exchange rate compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an expense reduction of  lower compensation expenses of  due to personnel reductions and lower commissions and marketing development fund expense of  due to lower sales 
the decrease in general and administrative expense for hcw of  was primarily due to lower professional fees  primarily for legal and consulting fees  of  a decrease in bad debt expense of  related to the february liquidation of compusa and the november bankruptcy of circuit city  a decrease in compensation expense of  due to staff reductions and a salary reduction  a reduction of  in insurance expense due to lower negotiated premiums  lower communication expense of  and lower travel expense of  due to travel budget reduction 
offsetting the expense decreases were increases of  in sales and marketing expense and  in general and administrative expense related to personnel and overhead expense of the pctv business acquired at the end of december from avid technology  inc amortization of intangible assets was related to intangible assets acquired in the purchase of the pctv business from avid technology  inc selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales the chart above indicates the quarterly fluctuations for technical support  general and administrative  sales and marketing and total selling  general and administrative expense 
due to fixed costs which fluctuate minimally with changes in sales coupled with the seasonal nature of our business  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales are sensitive to seasonal sales fluctuations 
over the eight quarters ending with the fourth quarter of fiscal  selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales has resulted in the following trends due to our first quarter yielding the highest quarterly sales levels of our fiscal year  our total selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales have typically been the lowest during our first quarter 
as reflected in the chart  selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales were the lowest in the first quarter of fiscal and reflecting the seasonal trend in sales  our selling  general and administrative expense for our third or fourth quarter are the highest as a percentage of sales 
as reflected in the chart  total selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales were the highest in the fourth quarter of fiscal and third quarter of fiscal reflecting the decline in sales  total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were higher for fiscal compared to fiscal with the expectation that the seasonal nature sales will continue for the near future  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales to reflect a future trend that is similar to the historical trends we have experienced over the prior two fiscal years 
research and development expense research and development expense increased  from the prior fiscal year as follows research and development expense fiscal increases decreases from fiscal hcw pctv total research and development expense hcw research and development expense pctv stock compensation expense total research and development expense excluding the expense of the pctv division  research and development expense decreased  from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to personnel and personnel related reductions and the timing of development programs in process 
offsetting the expense decreases were  in expense related to personnel and development programs of the pctv business acquired at the end of december other income other income for the twelve months ended september  was  compared to other income of  for the twelve months ended september  as detailed below twelve months ended september  interest income interest expense foreign currency transaction gains losses total other income expense lower interest income was due to lower interest rate yields coupled with less cash invested 
interest expense was due to payment on a note payable to avid technology  inc foreign currency transactions gains were due to favorable euro rates on forward exchange contracts 
tax provision our net tax provision for the year ended september  and is as follows twelve months ended september  income tax benefit due to change in deferred taxes tax expense european operations state taxes net tax benefit provision deferred tax assets and the offsetting tax valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the our hauppauge computer works inc domestic operations 
in evaluating the future realization of our deferred tax asset and the corresponding valuation allowance as of september   we took into consideration our domestic operations had taxable income for three out of the last four fiscal years including royalties paid to our domestic operations by our european subsidiary  we anticipate taxable income for our domestic operations for fiscal our history of utilization of prior domestic net operating losses after evaluating the circumstances listed above  it was our opinion that our net deferred tax asset of  is realizable as of september  as a result of all of the above items mentioned in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we had a net loss of  for the twelve months ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted net loss per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  compared to a net loss of  for the twelve months ended september   which resulted in basic and diluted net loss per share of on weighted average basic and diluted shares of  options to purchase  and  shares of common stock at prices ranging to and to  respectively  were outstanding as of september  and  respectively  but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share of common stock because they were anti dilutive 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  working capital and stockholders equity position is set forth below as of september  cash working capital stockholders equity we had cash and cash equivalents as of september  of  a decrease of  from september  the decrease in cash was due to operating investing financing activities activities activities total sources of cash decrease in inventory increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses proceeds from employee stock purchases decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets total sources of cash less cash used for net loss adjusted for non cash items pctv acquisition net of note payable increase in accounts receivables effect of exchange rates on cash capital equipment purchases total usage of cash net cash decrease net cash used in operating activities was due to an increase in accounts receivable of  and cash used of  to fund the net loss adjusted for non cash items 
offsetting these cash decreases in operating activities was a decrease in inventories of  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  the increase in accounts receivable was due to of the sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal being shipped in september coupled with a  sales increase for the fourth quarter of fiscal over the fourth quarter of fiscal lower fiscal sales resulted in lower inventory levels required to support sales and was the driving force in the decrease in inventory between fiscal and fiscal cash of  was used in investing activities 
of this amount   was used for the acquisition of the pctv business and  was used to purchase fixed assets 
the  used for the pctv acquisition consisted of  paid against the  purchase price   in payments made pursuant to a  note payable to avid technology  inc and  in payments for direct expenses of the acquisition 
as of september    was left to pay on the note payable and  was left to pay for direct acquisition costs 
cash of  from financing activities came from purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our cash requirements for the next twelve months will include  among other things  the cash required to pay off the note to avid technology  inc related to the purchase the pctv business and the cash needed to fund our working capital needs 
with the proper execution of our business and operational integration plan  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of september  and our internally generated cash will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs for the next twelve months 
failure to meet the operating and integration plan could require the need for additional sources of capital 
in light of the current economic and credit conditions there can be no assurances that we will be able to find external sources of financing to fund our additional working capital needs 
on march  our line of credit with the jp morgan chase bank expired and was not renewed 
on november   we approved a stock repurchase program 
the program authorized us to repurchase up to  shares of our own stock 
the stock repurchase program was extended by a resolution of our board of directors on december  at our august  board meeting  our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares which can be repurchased under the plan to  as of september   we held  treasury shares purchased for  at an average purchase price of approximately per share 
sources and usage of cash components the chart below shows our cash balances  sources of cash and usage of cash by quarter for fiscal through fiscal our sources and usage of cash primarily comes from the items listed below net income loss adjusted for non cash items changes in the levels of current assets and current liabilities  primarily accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable employee purchases of stock options purchase of capital equipment purchase of treasury stock since accounts receivable  inventory and current liabilities make up the majority of our current asset and current liability levels  our cash balances are affected by the increase and decrease of these assets and liabilities 
in the quarters where cash was used to increase the current asset levels or decrease the current liability levels  there was usually a corresponding decrease or neutral position in the cash balances during those quarters conversely  in the quarters when we generated cash by reducing the current asset levels or increasing the current liability levels  there was a corresponding increase in the cash balances during those quarters 
during fiscal   or about of the  cash decrease  was used to fund the pctv acquisition  the acquisition related direct costs and the acquisition related note payable to avid technology  inc we expect for the near term future that our operating structure will remain similar to past years  therefore our investment and subsequent changes in our current assets and current liabilities required to fund our operating cycles will continue to have a material impact on our cash generation  cash usage and cash balances 
line of credit on march  our line of credit with the jp morgan chase bank expired and was not renewed 
in addition to our operating cash requirements  our cash requirements during fiscal will include  required to pay the final three installments on the note payable to avid technology  inc with the proper execution of our operational plan we believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of september  and our internally generated cash flow will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our capital needs for the next twelve months 
failure to meet the operating plan could require the need for additional sources of capital 
in light of the current economic and credit conditions there can be no assurances that we will be able to find external sources of financing to fund our additional working capital needs

critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition management s estimates translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies on our european financial statements inventory obsolescence and reserves accounts receivable related reserves intangible assets revenue recognition we sell through a sales channel which consists of retailers  pc manufacturers and distributors 
the majority of our customers are granted lines of credit 
the product is shipped on account with the majority of customers typically given to day payment terms 
those customers deemed as large credit risks either pay in advance or issue us a letter of credit 
we require the customer to submit a purchase order to us 
the price of the product and payment terms are fixed per the terms of the purchase order 
upon shipment of the order to the customer  the title to the goods is passed to the customer 
the customer is legally obligated to pay for the order within the payment terms stated on the customer s purchase order 
the obligation to insure the boards and the cost of any pilferage while in the customer s possession is the responsibility of the customer 
we sell analog  hybrid video recorders or digital computer boards that are stocked on the shelves of retailers and are subject to the normal consumer traffic that retail stores attract 
aside from normal store promotions such as advertisements in the store s circular  we have no further obligation to assist in the resale of the products 
we offer some of our customers a right of return 
our accounting complies with fasb asc sfas revenue recognition when right of return exists  as typically at the end of every quarter we  based on historical data  evaluate our sales reserve level based on the previous six months sales 
due to the seasonal nature of the business coupled with the changing economic environment  management exercises some judgment with regard to the historical data to arrive at the reserve 
we offer mail in rebates on certain products at certain times as we may determine 
the rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales 
we also participate in limited cooperative advertising programs with retailers and distributors and account for these in accordance with fasb asc eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
management s estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to sales provisions  as described above  income taxes  bad debts  inventory allowances and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical data  when available  experience  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the combined results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies on our european financial statements the functional currency of our european subsidiary is the euro 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate assets and liabilities denominated in a non functional currency  mainly us dollars  to euros on the books of our european subsidiary 
this process results in exchange gains and losses depending on the changes in the euro to us dollar exchange rate 
under the relevant accounting guidance  with the exception of inter company accounts which are considered long term in nature  we are obligated to include these gains and losses on our statement of operations  which we report in other income or expense under the caption foreign currency 
the extent of these gains and losses can fluctuate greatly from month to month depending on the change in the exchange rate  causing results to vary widely 
due to the past volatility of the euro  it is difficult to forecast the long term trend of these gains and losses 
inventory obsolescence and reserves the technology underlying our products and other products in the computer industry  in general  is subject to rapid change  including the potential introduction of new types of products and technologies 
due to this  we maintain a program in which we review on a regular basis our inventory forecasting  inventory purchasing and our inventory levels 
we review our inventory realization and inventory reserves on a quarterly basis 
accounts receivable and related reserves on a daily basis we credit approve all orders scheduled for shipment 
customers who are over their credit limit or who have invoices that are past their due date are typically placed on credit hold until the credit problem is resolved 
credit reviews are performed on new customers 
existing customers who request an increased credit line are subject to a new credit review before increases in their credit line are approved 
our reserve for bad debt is done using a specific identification method 
on a quarterly basis we review the age and quality of our accounts receivable 
we reserve amounts due us from companies that have gone bankrupt or companies that we evaluate are near bankrupt 
our products are sold through a sales channel which consist of retailers  pc manufacturers and distributors 
our product is primarily a retail product sold to end user consumers 
similar to other companies in the computer industry  our products are subject to returns by the end user 
in recognition that product may be returned at a later date  at the end of every quarter  based on historical data  we evaluate our sales reserve level based on the previous six months sales and we adjust our sales reserve as required 
intangible assets long lived assets include indefinite and definite lived intangible assets 
definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets 
definite lived intangible assets primarily consist of covenant not to compete  customer relationships and technology 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of trademarks 
when an impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
although we believe our judgments  estimates and or assumptions used in estimating cash flows and determining fair value are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect such impairment analyses and our financial results 
inflation while inflation has not had a material effect on our operations in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to offset the effects of inflation on the costs of our products or services through price increases to our customers without experiencing a reduction in the demand for our products  or that inflation will not have an overall effect on the computer equipment market that would have a material affect on us 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted fasb asc sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a methodology for measuring fair value  and expands the required disclosure for fair value measurements 
on february   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
sfas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which amends sfas no 
by delaying its effective date by one year for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the adoption of sfas no 
for our financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
at september   we did not have any forward exchange contracts outstanding 
if we would have had forward exchange contracts outstanding their fair value at quarter end would have been determined via inputs that included quoted prices for similar foreign exchange contracts in active markets and were thus considered to be level inputs under the sfas hierarchy see note derivative and hedging activities 
effective october   sfas no 
will also apply to all other fair value measurements for us 
we are evaluating the effect the implementation of sfas no 
will have on our non financial assets and non financial liabilities on our consolidated financial statements 
the carrying amount of cash  accounts receivables and accounts payables and other short term financial instruments approximate their fair value due to their short term nature 
we believe that borrowings outstanding under our note payable approximate fair value due to the short term duration of the loan 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance for business combinations that will significantly change the accounting for business combinations in a number of areas including the treatment of contingent consideration  contingencies  acquisition costs  ipr d and restructuring costs 
the changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties in a business combination after the measurement period will impact income tax expense 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet evaluated the impact  if any  of adopting this pronouncement 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests nci and classified as a component of equity 
this new consolidation method will significantly change the accounting for transactions with minority interest holders 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet evaluated the impact  if any  of adopting this pronouncement
