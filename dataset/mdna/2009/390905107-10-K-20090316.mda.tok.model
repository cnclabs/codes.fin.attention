critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss once loans default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
the bank s latest annual regulatory examination was completed in october additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   under the section titled item business allowances for losses on loans and foreclosed assets 
judgments and assumptions used by management in the past have resulted in an overall allowance for loan losses that has been sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships 
from time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance  cash flow of the borrower  value of collateral  or other factors 
in these instances  management may have to revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances 
in some cases  additional losses may be realized  in other instances  the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit 
for the periods included in these financial statements  management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses has not changed significantly 
in addition  the company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management s best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets 
while the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties  the amount that the company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially in the near term from the carrying value reflected in these financial statements  resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangibles assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a process that estimates the fair value of each of the company s reporting units compared with its carrying value 
the company defines reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there are discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed 
as of december   the company has two reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated the bank and the travel division which is a division of a subsidiary of the bank 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then no impairment is recorded 
if the carrying value amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  further testing is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values to those assets to their carrying values 
at december   goodwill consisted of  at the bank reporting unit and  at the travel reporting unit 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to seven years 
at december   the amortizable intangible assets consisted of core deposit intangibles of  at the bank reporting unit and  of non compete agreements at the travel reporting unit 
these amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  the company used a market approach to value its reporting units 
the market approach applies a market multiple  based on observed purchase transactions for each reporting unit  to the metrics appropriate for the valuation of the operating unit 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment may include developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
based on the company s goodwill impairment testing  management does not believe any of its goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired as of december  while the company believes no impairment existed at december   different conditions or assumptions used to measure fair value of reporting units  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the company s impairment evaluation in the future 
current economic conditions the current economic environment presents financial institutions with unprecedented circumstances and challenges which in some cases have resulted in large declines in the fair values of investments and other assets  constraints on liquidity and significant credit quality problems  including severe volatility in the valuation of real estate and other collateral supporting loans 
the financial statements have been prepared using values and information currently available to the company 
given the volatility of current economic conditions  the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements could change rapidly  resulting in material future adjustments in asset values  the allowance for loan losses  or capital that could negatively impact the company s ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity 
general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the bank earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
in the year ended december   great southern s net loans decreased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  as loan demand is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  and because of the competition we face  we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in prior years 
based upon the current lending environment and economic conditions  the company does not expect to grow the overall loan portfolio significantly  if at all  at this time 
however  some loan categories have experienced increases 
the main loan areas experiencing increases in were commercial real estate loans  one to four family and multifamily real estate loans and consumer loans  partially offset by lower balances in construction loans and commercial business loans 
in the year ended december   outstanding residential and commercial construction loan balances decreased million  to million at december  in addition  the undisbursed portion of construction and land development loans decreased million from million at december   to million at december  the company s strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels given the current credit and economic environments 
in addition  the level of non performing loans and foreclosed assets may affect our net interest income and net income 
while we have not had an overall high level of charge offs on our non performing loans prior to  we do not accrue interest income on these loans and do not recognize interest income until the loan is repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loans 
generally  the higher the level of non performing assets  the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income 
we expect loan loss provision  non performing assets and foreclosed assets to remain elevated 
in addition  expenses related to the credit resolution process should also remain elevated 
in the year ended december   great southern s available for sale securities increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the company s mix of securities changed in primarily in two categories 
us government agency debt securities decreased million primarily due to maturing short term securities and longer term securities that were called at par by the issuing agency 
the company elected to replace these securities with us government agency mortgage backed securities  which increased million  to cover pledging requirements for public funds and customer repurchase agreements 
most of these agency mortgage backed securities purchased in have interest rates that are fixed for a period of three to ten years and then adjust annually 
securities which provided the company an acceptable yield were also purchased in to utilize the excess liquidity from loan repayments and the issuance of brokered deposits 
in addition  great southern had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  subsequent to december   additional customer deposits have been placed with great southern  resulting in cash and cash equivalents of million at march  the company could elect to utilize these funds by repaying some of its brokered deposits or purchasing additional investment securities  or it may maintain its cash equivalents 
the company attracts deposit accounts through our retail branch network  correspondent banking and corporate services areas  and brokered deposits 
the company then utilizes these deposit funds  along with federal home loan bank fhlbank advances and other borrowings  to meet loan demand 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million  or 
however  the mix of deposits continued to shift from checking deposits to certificates of deposit  primarily brokered cds 
interest bearing transaction accounts decreased million while non interest bearing checking accounts decreased million 
retail certificates of deposit decreased million 
there is a high level of competition for deposits in our markets 
while it is our goal to gain checking account and certificate of deposit market share in our branch footprint  we cannot be assured of this in future periods 
in and  our non interest bearing checking account balances have decreased  primarily as a result of lower balances being kept in correspondent bank customers accounts 
these lower balances are due to the effects of the correspondent customers clearing checks through other avenues using electronic presentment  thus requiring lower compensating balances 
subsequent to december   correspondent balances have begun to increase again 
a significant amount of the reduction in interest bearing checking balances was the result of customers moving funds into customer reverse repurchase agreements 
total brokered deposits were million at december   up from million at december  included in these totals at december  and december   were great southern bank customer deposits totaling million and million  respectively  that are part of the cdars program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the fdic deposit insurance limit 
the company decided to increase the amount of longer term brokered certificates of deposit in to provide liquidity for operations and to maintain in reserve its available secured funding lines with the federal home loan bank fhlbank and the federal reserve bank 
in  the company issued approximately million of new brokered certificates which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company at its discretion may redeem at par generally after six months 
as market interest rates on these types of deposits have decreased in recent months  the company has begun to redeem some of these deposits in in order to lock in cheaper funding rates or reduce excess cash balances 
in addition in  the company issued approximately million of new brokered certificates  which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company may not redeem prior to maturity 
there are no interest rate swaps associated with these brokered certificates 
these funding changes contributed to decreases in our net interest income and net interest margin 
these longer term certificates carry an interest rate that is approximately basis points higher than the interest rate that the company would have paid if it instead utilized short term advances from the fhlbank 
the company decided the higher rate was justified by the longer term and the ability to keep committed funding lines available 
the net interest margin was also negatively impacted as the company originated some of the new certificates in advance of the anticipated terminations of the existing certificates  thereby causing the company to have excess funds for a period of time 
these excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents at rates that at times caused the company to earn a negative spread 
partially offsetting the increase in brokered cds  several existing brokered certificates were redeemed by the company in as the related interest rate swaps were terminated by the swap counterparties 
these redeemed certificates had effective interest rates through the interest rate swaps of approximately day libor 
interest rate swap notional amounts have decreased from million at december   to million at december  our ability to fund growth in future periods may also be dependent on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and fhlbank advances 
in times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits  we have utilized brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund these loans 
these funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create variable rate funding  if desired  which more closely matches the variable rate nature of much of our loan portfolio 
while we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods  if this should happen  the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by market interest rate changes 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the prime rate and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts 
we also have a portion of our liabilities that will reprice with changes to the federal funds rate or the three month libor rate 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
ongoing changes in the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve pose challenges for interest rate risk management 
beginning in the second half of and through september   the board of governors of the federal reserve system the frb increased short term interest rates through steady increases to the federal funds rate 
other short term rates  such as libor and short term us treasury rates  increased in conjunction with these increases by the frb 
by september   the frb had raised the federal funds rates by from in june and other short term rates rose by corresponding amounts 
however  there was not a parallel shift in the yield curve  intermediate and long term interest rates did not increase at a corresponding pace 
this caused the shape of the interest rate yield curve to become much flatter  which creates different issues for interest rate risk management 
on september   the frb decreased the federal funds rate by basis points and many market interest rates began to fall in the following weeks 
in the months following september  the frb has reduced the federal funds rate by an additional basis points 
the federal funds rate now stands at 
however  funding costs for most financial services companies have not declined in tandem with these reductions in the federal funds rate 
competition for deposits  the desire for longer term funding  elevated libor interest rates and wide credit spreads have kept borrowing costs relatively high in the current environment 
another factor that continues to negatively impact net interest income is the elevated level of libor interest rates compared to federal funds rates as a result of credit and liquidity concerns in financial markets 
these libor interest rates were elevated approximately basis points compared to historical averages versus the stated federal funds rate for much of in the latter portion of december and so far into  libor rates have decreased from their higher levels in comparison to the stated federal funds rate 
while these libor interest rates are still elevated compared to historical averages in relation to federal funds  they have decreased along with recent decreases in the federal funds rate 
the company has reduced the amount and percentage of interest rate swaps and other borrowings that are indexed to libor 
the company does not find libor based interest rate swaps to be attractive at this time 
funding costs related to local market deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have also been elevated due to competition by issuers seeking to generate significant funding 
the frb most recently cut interest rates on december  great southern has a significant portfolio of loans which are tied to a prime rate of interest 
some of these loans are tied to some national index of prime  while most are indexed to great southern prime 
the company has elected to leave its great southern prime rate of interest at in light of the current highly competitive funding environment for deposits  including libor rates that have been elevated 
this does not affect a large number of customers as a majority of the loans indexed to great southern prime are already at interest rate floors which are provided for in individual loan documents 
but for the interest rate floors  a rate cut by the frb generally would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as the federal funds rate adjusts 
because the federal funds rate is already very low  there may also be a negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the company s inability to lower its funding costs in the current environment 
usually any negative impact is expected to be offset over the following to day period  and subsequently is expected to have a positive impact  as the company s interest rates on deposits  borrowings and interest rate swaps would normally also go down as a result of a reduction in interest rates by the frb  assuming normal credit  liquidity and competitive loan and deposit pricing pressures 
any anticipated positive impact will likely be reduced by the change in the funding mix noted above  as well as retail deposit competition in the company s market areas 
in addition  great southern s net interest margin has been negatively affected by certain characteristics of some of its loans  deposit mix  loan and deposit pricing by competitors  and timing of interest rate changes by the frb as compared to interest rate changes in the financial markets 
for the twelve months ended december   and  interest income was reduced million and million  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans which were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest which was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the twelve months ended december   and  respectively  due to work out efforts on non performing assets 
on a combined basis  this reduced net interest income and net interest margin 
in addition  net interest income and net interest margin were negatively impacted by the effects of the accounting entries recorded for certain interest rate swaps amortization of deposit broker origination fees 
this amortization expense reduced net interest income by million and million in and  respectively 
the negative impact of declining loan interest rates has been partially mitigated by the positive effects of the company s loans which have interest rate floors 
at december   the company had a portfolio of prime based loans totaling approximately million with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest 
of this total  million also had interest rate floors 
these floors were at varying rates  with million of these loans having floor rates of or greater and another million of these loans having floor rates between and 
at december   million of these loans were at their floor rates 
during and  the company s loan portfolio had loans with rate floors that were much lower 
however  since market interest rates were also much lower at that time  these loan rate floors went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this contributed to a loan yield for the entire portfolio which was approximately and basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  and  respectively 
as interest rates rose in the second half of and throughout and  these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
at december   the loan yield for the portfolio was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest  resulting in lower interest rate margins 
at december   the loan portfolio yield was approximately basis points lower than the prime rate of interest 
during the latter portion of and throughout  as the prime rate of interest has gone down  the company s loan portfolio again has had loans with rate floors that went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this contributed to a loan yield for the entire portfolio which was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  at december   the loan yield for the portfolio had increased to a level that was approximately basis points higher than the national prime rate of interest 
while interest rate floors have had an overall positive effect on the company s results  they do subject the company to the risk that borrowers will elect to refinance their loans with other lenders 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by our travel  insurance and investment divisions  late charges and prepayment fees on loans  gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments and other general operating income 
non interest income is also affected by the company s interest rate hedging activities 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  expenses related to foreclosed assets  postage  insurance  advertising and public relations  telephone  professional fees  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
non interest income for decreased primarily as a result of the impairment write down in value of the company s investments in available for sale fannie mae and freddie mac perpetual preferred stock and certain other available for sale equity investments and lower commission revenue from the company s travel and investment divisions  partially offset by an increase in income related to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits 
the impairment write down totaled million on a pre tax basis including million related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock  which was discussed in previous filings 
these equity investments have experienced significant fair value declines over the past year 
it is unclear if or when the values of these investment securities will improve  or whether such values will deteriorate further 
based on these developments  the company recorded an other than temporary impairment 
the company continues to hold these securities in the available for sale category 
the company also recorded an impairment write down of million on a pre tax basis in the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits resulted in an increase in non interest income of million in  and an increase of million in income of this magnitude related to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in the fair value of hedged deposits should not be expected in future periods 
this income is part of a accounting restatement in which approximately million net of taxes was charged against retained earnings in this charge has been and continues to be recovered in subsequent periods as interest rate swaps matured or were terminated by the swap counterparty 
total non interest expense increased in compared to due to expenses related to problem loans and foreclosed assets  expenses related to fdic insurance premiums and the continued growth of the company 
due to the increase in the level of foreclosed assets  foreclosure related expenses increased million in compared to in  the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic began to once again assess insurance premiums on insured institutions 
under the new pricing system  institutions in all risk categories  even the best rated  are charged an fdic premium 
great southern received a deposit insurance credit as a result of premiums previously paid 
the company s credit offset assessed premiums for the first half of  but premiums were owed by the company in the latter half of and into the company incurred additional deposit insurance expense of  in compared to the company expects significantly increased expense in as a result of the fdic increasing regular insurance premiums for all banks 
in addition  the fdic has proposed a special assessment to be levied against all banks in see item business  government supervision and regulations  insurance of accounts and regulation by the fdic 
in addition to the expense increases noted above  the company s increase in non interest expense in the year ended december   compared to  related to the continued growth of the company 
late in the first quarter of  great southern completed its acquisition of a travel agency in st 
louis 
in addition  since june  the company opened banking centers in springfield  mo 
and branson  mo 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
business initiatives the company is expanding its retail banking center network in the st 
louis and kansas city metropolitan regions 
this is part of the company s overall long term plan to open two to three banking centers per year as market conditions warrant 
the company s first retail banking center in the st 
louis market is expected to open in april located in creve coeur  mo  the full service banking center will complement a loan production office and a great southern travel office already in operation in this market 
construction will be underway soon on a second banking center in the lee s summit  mo  market  a suburb of kansas city 
the banking center should be completed in late and will enhance access and service to lee s summit area customers 
great southern opened its first lee s summit retail location in great southern is participating in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which consists of two basic components the transaction account guarantee program and the debt guarantee program 
through the transaction account guarantee program  great southern is purchasing additional fdic insurance coverage for its customers 
great southern customers with noninterest bearing deposit accounts  lawyer s trust accounts  and now accounts paying interest at a rate less than percent will be fully insured by the fdic regardless of the account balance  through december  coverage under the transaction account guarantee program is in addition to and separate from the coverage available under the fdic s general deposit insurance rules  which was recently increased from  to  per depositor 
the debt guarantee program  which guarantees newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks and thrifts  could be utilized by the company in the future 
at present  the company has no senior unsecured debt outstanding 
effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank

and r 
the purpose of the proposed statement is intended to improve the quality of financial reporting by expanding disclosures required about certain loss contingencies 
investors and other users of financial information have expressed concerns that current disclosures required in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  do not provide sufficient information in a timely manner to assist users of financial statements in assessing the likelihood  timing  and amount of future cash flows associated with loss contingencies 
if approved as written  this proposed statement would expand disclosures about certain loss contingencies in the scope of sfas no 
or sfas no 
revised  business combinations  and would be effective for fiscal years ending after december   and interim and annual periods in subsequent fiscal years 
the fasb continues to deliberate this proposed standard at this time 
in june  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
the purpose of the proposed statement is intended to simplify hedge accounting resulting in increased comparability of financial results for entities that apply hedge accounting 
specifically  the proposed statement would eliminate the multiple methods of hedge accounting currently being used for the same transaction 
it also would require an entity to designate all risks as the hedged risk with certain exceptions in the hedged item or transaction  thus better reflecting the economics of such items and transactions in the financial statements 
additional objectives of the proposed statement are to simplify accounting for hedging activities  improve the financial reporting of hedging activities to make the accounting model and associated disclosures more useful and easier to understand for users of financial statements  resolve major practice issues related to hedge accounting that have arisen under statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and address differences resulting from recognition and measurement anomalies between the accounting for derivative instruments and the accounting for hedged items or transactions 
if approved as written  the proposed statement would require application of the amended hedging requirements for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the fasb continues to deliberate this proposed standard at this time 
in august  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of financial accounting standards  earnings per share an amendment of fasb statement no 
the fasb is issuing this proposed statement as part of a joint project with the international accounting standards board iasb 
the fasb and the iasb undertook that project to eliminate differences between fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  and ias  earnings per share  in ways that also would clarify and simplify the earnings per share eps computation 
this proposed statement proposes amendments to statement that would improve the comparability of eps because the denominator used to compute eps under statement would be the same as the denominator used to compute eps under ias  with limited exceptions 
the fasb continues to deliberate this proposed standard at this time 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determining the fair value of an asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp clarifies how statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas should be applied when valuing securities in markets that are not active and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value in this circumstance 
the fsp states that an entity should not automatically conclude that a particular transaction price is determinative of fair value 
in a dislocated market  judgment is required to evaluate whether individual transactions are forced liquidations or distressed sales 
when relevant observable market information is not available  a valuation approach that incorporates management s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset in a current sale transaction would be acceptable 
the fsp also indicates that quotes from brokers or pricing services may be relevant inputs when measuring fair value  but are not necessarily determinative in the absence of an active market for the asset 
the adoption of fsp  effective upon issuance  did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of financial accounting standards  subsequent events 
the objective of this proposed statement is to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur subsequent to the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  this proposed statement sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity would evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity would recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that an entity would make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the fasb continues to deliberate this proposed standard at this time 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
and fin r  disclosure by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities 
this fsp amends sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and amends fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  to require public entities to provide additional disclosures about their involvement in variable interest entities and certain special purpose entities 
this fsp was effective for the first reporting period ending after december  the company has not engaged in these types of transfers of financial assets  therefore  no additional disclosures were required 
in january  the fasb issued proposed fasb staff position no 
b and apb a  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this proposed fsp would amend fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements 
this fsp also would amend apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require those disclosures in all interim financial statements 
this fsp  if adopted as it is currently written  is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after march  in february  the fasb decided to reexpose proposed fasb staff position no 
c  measuring liabilities under fasb statement no 
this proposed fsp would clarify the principles in fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements  on the measurement of liabilities 
this fsp  if adopted as it is currently written  will be applied on a prospective basis effective on the beginning of the period that includes the issuance date of the fsp 
in march  the fasb issued proposed fsp fas r a  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
in december  the fasb issued the final fsp fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
this fsp is the result of fasb s redeliberations of that proposed fsp 
the provisions of this fsp only apply to single employer defined benefit plans  the company participates in a multi employer defined benefit pension plan 
therefore  the requirements of this fsp will not affect the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company  or the related disclosures about plan assets 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during the year ended december   the company increased total assets by million to billion 
net loans decreased by million 
the main loan areas experiencing decreases were commercial and residential construction and commercial business 
this was partially offset by increases in single family and multi family residential mortgage loans and consumer loans 
given the current economy  the company expects that loan growth overall may continue to be negative as the construction loan category will likely continue to decrease 
the company expects to continue to increase balances in single family and multi family residential mortgage loans and consumer loans 
available for sale investment securities increased by million  primarily due to increased balances of u 
s 
government and u 
s 
government agency mortgage backed securities which were used for pledging to public fund deposit accounts and customer repurchase agreements  and to provide additional liquidity to the company 
while there is no specifically stated goal  the available for sale securities portfolio has in recent years been approximately to of total assets 
the available for sale securities portfolio was and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents increased million  again due to the company s decision to maintain additional liquidity in and due to funds received from us treasury under the capital purchase program cpp 
foreclosed assets increased million  primarily due to the foreclosure of several loan relationships throughout see non performing assets for additional information on foreclosed assets 
total liabilities increased million from december  to billion at december  deposits increased million  securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements with customers increased million  structured repurchase agreements increased million and short term borrowings increased million  while fhlbank advances decreased million 
the increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with customers was the result of corporate customers desires to place funds in excess of deposit insurance limits in secured accounts 
the increase in short term borrowings related to additional term borrowings from the frb under the term auction facility program 
fhlbank advances decreased from million at december   to million at december  the level of fhlbank advances will fluctuate depending on growth in the company s loan portfolio and other funding needs and sources of the company 
in september  the company entered into a structured repo borrowing transaction for million 
this borrowing bears interest at a fixed rate of if three month libor remains at or less on quarterly interest reset dates  if libor is above the rate on quarterly interest reset dates  then the company s borrowing rate decreases by times the difference in libor up to basis points 
deposits excluding brokered and national certificates of deposit decreased million from december  retail cds and non interest bearing transaction accounts decreased million and million  respectively 
interest bearing checking accounts mainly money market accounts decreased million 
checking account balances totaled million at december   down from million at december  a significant amount of this reduction in checking balances was moved into customer reverse repurchase agreements as noted above 
total brokered deposits were million at december   up from million at december  included in these totals at december  and december   were great southern bank customer deposits totaling million and million  respectively  that are part of the cdars program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the fdic deposit insurance limit 
the company decided to increase the amount of longer term brokered certificates of deposit in to provide liquidity for operations and to maintain in reserve its available secured funding lines with the fhlbank and the frb 
in  the company issued approximately million of new brokered certificates which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company at its discretion may redeem at par generally after six months 
as market interest rates on these types of deposits have decreased in recent months  the company has begun to redeem some of these certificates in in order to lock in cheaper funding rates or reduce excess cash balances 
in addition during  the company issued approximately million of new brokered certificates  which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company may not redeem prior to maturity 
there are no interest rate swaps associated with these brokered certificates 
total stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december  the large increase was the result of the company s participation in the treasury s cpp  under which the company issued million of perpetual preferred stock and common stock warrants 
the company recorded a net loss for fiscal year of million and accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased  total stockholders equity was also reduced by common dividends declared of million and preferred dividends of  in  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share and reissued  shares of company stock at an average price of per share to cover stock option exercises 
at december   common stockholders equity was million of total assets  equivalent to a book value of per common share 
our participation in the cpp currently precludes us from purchasing shares of the company s stock until the earlier of december  or our repayment of the cpp funds 
management has historically utilized stock buy back programs from time to time as long as repurchasing the stock contributed to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the number of shares of stock repurchased and the price paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market 
results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and general including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and  net income decreased million  or  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an increase in provision for loan losses of million  or  an increase in non interest expense of million  or  and a decrease in non interest income of million  or  partially offset by a decrease in provision for income taxes of million  or  and an increase in net interest income of  or

see item selected consolidated financial data restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current and previously reported financial statements due to the company s accounting change for certain interest rate swaps in the information presented in the table below and elsewhere in this report excluding hedge accounting entries recorded for the  and periods is not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the tables below and elsewhere in this report excluding hedge accounting entries recorded for the  and periods contain reconciliations of this information to the reported information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company believes that this non gaap financial information is useful in its internal management financial analyses and may also be useful to investors because the company believes that the exclusion of these items from the specified components of net income better reflect the company s underlying operating results during the periods indicated for the reasons described above 
the amortization of the deposit broker fee and the net change in fair value of interest rate swaps and related deposits may be volatile 
for example  if market interest rates decrease significantly  the interest rate swap counterparties may wish to terminate the swaps prior to their stated maturities 
if a swap is terminated  it is likely that the company would redeem the related deposit account at face value 
if the deposit account is redeemed  any unamortized broker fee associated with the deposit account must be written off to interest expense 
in addition  if the interest rate swap is terminated  there may be an income or expense impact related to the fair values of the swap and related deposit which were previously recorded in the company s financial statements 
the effect on net income  net interest income  net interest margin and non interest income could be significant in any given reporting period

interest income for loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets increased due to higher average balances 
interest income for investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased slightly due to lower average rates of interest while loans experienced a significant decrease in average rates of interest due to the significant rate cuts by the frb in interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest income on loans decreased primarily due to significantly lower average interest rates 
interest income on loans decreased million as the result of lower average interest rates 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  average loan rates were much lower in compared to  as a result of market rates of interest  primarily the prime rate of interest 
during the last quarter of  market interest rates decreased  with the prime rate of interest decreasing by the end of december then in  the prime rate decreased another to a rate of at december  a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
the company has a portfolio of prime based loans which have interest rate floors 
prior to  many of these loan rate floors were in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
during and  as market interest rates rose  many of these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
in  the declining interest rates once again put these loan rate floors in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of a negative basis point 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of basis points 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the higher average balance resulted principally from the bank s increased commercial real estate lending  single family and multi family residential lending and consumer lending 
the bank s commercial and residential construction and commercial business average loan balances experienced small decreases compared to for the years ended december   and  interest income was reduced million and million  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  due to work out efforts on non performing loans 
see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased as a result of higher average balances during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in available for sale mortgage backed securities  where securities were needed for liquidity and pledging against deposit accounts under customer repurchase agreements and public fund deposits 
the balance of available for sale mortgage backed securities has increased from million at december  to million at december  interest income decreased by million as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  in previous years  as principal balances on mortgage backed securities were paid down through prepayments and normal amortization  the company replaced a large portion of these securities with variable rate mortgage backed securities primarily one year and hybrid arms 
as these securities reached interest rate reset dates in  their rates typically increased along with market interest rate increases 
as market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates generally declined in and into  the interest rates on those securities that reprice in likely will decrease at their next interest rate reset date 
the majority of the securities added in are backed by hybrid arms which will have fixed rates of interest for a period of time generally three to ten years and then will adjust annually 
the actual amount of securities that will reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities is subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
in addition at december   the company had several agency securities that were callable at the option of the issuer 
many of these securities were redeemed by the issuer in  so the balance of u 
s 
government agency securities has decreased from million at december  to million at december  this balance has declined further in in addition to the increase in securities  the company has also experienced an increase in interest earning deposits and non interest earning cash equivalents  where additional liquidity was maintained in due to uncertainty in the financial system 
these deposits and cash equivalents earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  total interest expense including the effects of the company s accounting change in for certain interest rate swaps  total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements of million  or  and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or

see item selected consolidated financial data restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current and previously reported financial statements due to the company s accounting change for certain interest rate swaps in interest expense deposits including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and  interest on demand deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest in market rates of interest on checking and money market accounts began to decrease in late and throughout as the frb reduced short term interest rates 
interest on demand deposits increased  due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the company s interest bearing checking balances have grown in the past several years through increased relationships with correspondent  corporate and retail customers 
average interest bearing demand balances were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
average non interest bearing demand balances were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense on deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest in market rates of interest on certificates of deposit began to decrease in late and throughout as the frb reduced short term interest rates 
as certificates of deposit matured in  they were generally replaced with certificates bearing a lower rate of interest 
in and  the company increased its balances of brokered certificates of deposit to fund a portion of its loan growth 
in  the company increased its balances of brokered certificates of deposit to lengthen a portion of its funding liabilities and to increase liquidity on its balance sheet in addition to its off balance sheet funding credit lines 
brokered certificates of deposit balances increased million in  from million at december   to million at december  a large portion of this increase relates to the program described below 
included in the brokered deposits total at december   is which is part of the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
this total includes in cdars customer deposit accounts and in cdars purchased funds 
included in the brokered deposits total at december   was which was part of the cdars 
this total includes in cdars customer deposit accounts and in cdars purchased funds 
cdars customer deposit accounts are accounts that are just like any other deposit account on the company s books  except that the account total exceeds the fdic deposit insurance maximum 
when a customer places a large deposit with a cdars network bank  that bank uses cdars to place the funds into deposit accounts issued by other banks in the cdars network 
this occurs in increments of less than the standard fdic insurance maximum  so that both principal and interest are eligible for complete fdic protection 
other network members do the same thing with their customers funds 
cdars purchased funds transactions represent an easy  cost effective source of funding without collateralization or credit limits for the company 
purchased funds transactions help the company obtain large blocks of funding while providing control over pricing and diversity of wholesale funding options 
purchased funds transactions are obtained through a bid process that occurs weekly  with varying maturity terms 
the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and did not impact interest on demand deposits 
excluding the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and  economically  interest expense on deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest throughout see item selected consolidated financial data restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current and previously reported financial statements due to the company s accounting change for certain interest rate swaps in interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average balances on fhlbank advances from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the reason for this decrease was the company elected to utilize other forms of alternative funding during in addition  fhlbank advances experienced a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   resulting in decreased interest expense of million 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements decreased million due to a decrease in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease  average balances increased from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december   resulting in increased interest expense of million 
the increase in balances of short term borrowings was primarily due to increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with great southern s corporate customers  utilization of the federal reserve s term auction facility and a structured repurchase agreement borrowing entered into in the frb began to lower short term interest rates in the latter portion of and continued to maintain very low rates throughout interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased  due to a decrease in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease  interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased  due to increases in average balances from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the average rate of interest on these subordinated debentures decreased in as these liabilities pay a variable rate of interest that is indexed to libor 
in november  the company redeemed its trust preferred debentures which were issued in and replaced them with new trust preferred debentures 
these new debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at a rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
in july  the company issued additional trust preferred debentures 
these new debentures are also not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at a rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income including the impact of the accounting entries recorded for certain interest rate swaps  net interest income for the year ended december  increased  to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was in the year ended december   compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
most of the decrease in net interest margin resulted from the decision by the company to increase the amount of longer term brokered certificates of deposit during to provide liquidity for operations and to maintain in reserve its available secured funding lines with the fhlbank and the frb 
in  the company issued approximately million of new brokered certificates which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company at its discretion may redeem at par generally after six months 
as market interest rates on these types of deposits have decreased in recent months  the company has begun to redeem some of these certificates in in order to lock in cheaper funding rates 
in addition during  the company issued approximately million of new brokered certificates  which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company may not redeem prior to maturity 
there are no interest rate swaps associated with these brokered certificates 
these longer term certificates carry an interest rate that is approximately basis points higher than the interest rate that the company would have paid if it instead utilized short term advances from the fhlbank 
the company decided the higher rate was justified by the longer term and the ability to keep committed funding lines available throughout the net interest margin was also negatively impacted as the company originated some of the new certificates in advance of the anticipated terminations of these existing certificates  thereby causing the company to have excess funds for a period of time 
these excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents at rates that at times caused the company to earn a negative spread 
the average balance of interest bearing cash equivalents in the three and twelve months ended december   was million and million  respectively 
this compares to the average balance of interest bearing cash equivalents in the three and twelve months ended december   of million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting the increase in brokered cds  several existing brokered certificates were redeemed by the company in as the related interest rate swaps were terminated by the swap counterparties 
interest rate swap notional amounts have decreased from million at december   to million at december  the company expects to redeem or replace more brokered deposits in as the excess liquidity is determined by management to no longer be warranted 
interest rates on brokered deposits of similar maturities to those that are callable by the company have decreased as much as basis points from the rates currently paid on these deposits by the company 
the company currently has approximately million of such brokered deposits which may be redeemed at the company s discretion in the first half of another factor that in negatively impacted net interest income was the elevated level of libor interest rates compared to federal funds rates as a result of credit and liquidity concerns in financial markets 
these libor interest rates were elevated approximately basis points compared to historical averages versus the stated federal funds rate for a significant portion of this elevated spread has continued into as the frb has kept the federal funds rate at 
while these libor interest rates are still elevated compared to historical averages in relation to federal funds  they have decreased along with recent decreases in the federal funds rate 
the company has reduced the amount and percentage of interest rate swaps and other borrowings that are indexed to libor 
funding costs related to local market deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have also been elevated due to competition by issuers seeking to generate significant funding 
for the years ended december  and  interest income was reduced million and million  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin decreased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances decreased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings decreased basis points  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased basis points

the prime rate of interest averaged during the year ended december  compared to an average of during the year ended december  in the last three months of and throughout  the frb decreased short term interest rates 
at december   the national prime rate stood at and the company s average interest rate on its loan portfolio was 
over half of the bank s loans were tied to prime at december   however  most of these loans had interest rate floors or were indexed to great southern bank prime  which has not been reduced below

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in versus million in the increase in provision for loan losses and charge offs for the year ended december   was due principally to the million which was provided for and charged off in the quarter ended march   related to the company s loans to the arkansas based bank holding company and related loans to individuals described in the company s quarterly report on form q for march  in addition  general market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to increased provisions and charge offs 
as properties were transferred into non performing loans or foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
in may  the company determined to record a provision expense and related charge off of million related to a million stock loan to an arkansas based bank holding company abhc and the under collateralized portion of other associated loans totaling million  which loans were previously discussed in the company s annual report on form k filed on march   current report on form k filed on may   and quarterly report on form q filed on may  the charge off resulted from the appointment of the fdic as receiver for abhc s subsidiary  abank  by the occ on may   and the closing of abank by the fdic that same day 
as a result of these regulatory actions  the million loan as well as million  representing the undercollateralized portion of other related loans  were charged off by the company  with the provision expense and associated charge off recorded in the first quarter of management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense 
management has long ago established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio 
more recently  additional procedures have been implemented to provide for more frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size  loan type  delinquencies  on going correspondence with borrowers  and problem loan work outs 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss  and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was  and at december   september   and december   respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on recent internal and external reviews of the company s loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
if economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time  and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate 
non performing assets at december   were million  up million from december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   compared to at december  compared to december   non performing loans decreased million to million while foreclosed assets increased million to million 
commercial real estate  construction and business loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  non performing loans 
compared to december   non performing loans decreased million to million 
non performing loan increases and decreases are described below 
increases in non performing loans in  that remained in non performing loans at december   included an million loan relationship  which is secured primarily by multiple subdivisions in the st 
louis area 
this relationship was charged down million upon transfer to non performing loans 
the million balance represents the company s total exposure  but only of the total borrowers liability  with participated to other banks 
this relationship has been with great southern since and lot sales have slowed 
a million loan relationship  which is secured primarily by eleven houses for sale in northwest arkansas 
four of the houses are either under contract or have contracts pending  but none of these sales have been completed at this time 
a million loan relationship  which is secured primarily by a condominium development in kansas city 
some sales occurred during  with the outstanding balance decreasing million in no sales occurred in  however  some principal reduction payments were made 
this relationship was charged down approximately  upon transfer to non performing loans in the third quarter of  to a balance of million 
a million loan relationship  which is secured primarily by a residential subdivision development and developed lots in various subdivisions in springfield  mo 
this relationship was charged down  to million at december  upon receipt of updated appraisals to establish the current value of the collateral 
a million loan relationship  which is secured primarily by commercial land and acreage to be developed into commercial lots in northwest arkansas 
this relationship was transferred to non performing loans in the third quarter of it was charged down approximately  upon transfer to foreclosed assets in the first quarter of  to a balance of million 
at december   six loan relationships in excess of million accounted for million of the total non performing loan balance of million 
in addition to the five relationships in excess of million noted above  one other significant loan relationship was included in non performing loans at december   and remained there at december  this relationship is described below a million loan relationship  which is secured by a condominium and retail historic rehabilitation development in st 
louis 
the original relationship has been reduced through the receipt of tax increment financing funds and a portion of the federal and state historic tax credits ultimately expected to be received by the company in upon receipt of the remaining federal and state tax credits  the company expects to reduce the balance of this relationship to approximately million  the value of which is substantiated by a recent appraisal

potential problem loans 
potential problem loans decreased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans decreased primarily due to the transfer of four unrelated significant relationships totaling million from the potential problem loans category to other non performing asset categories as previously discussed above 
two of these relationships involve residential construction and development loans one relationship in springfield totaling million and one relationship in the st 
louis area totaling million 
the two other relationships involve a motel in the state of florida totaling million and a condominium development in kansas city totaling million 
in addition  one other relationship that is secured primarily by a subdivision and vacant land near little rock  arkansas was removed from the potential problem loan category due to an ownership change in the project  which added equity to the project as well as additional guarantor support  and a reduction of  from the sale of a portion of the collateral 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans increased primarily due to the addition of four unrelated relationships totaling million to the potential problem loans category 
the first relationship consists of an office building and commercial land near springfield  missouri totaling million 
the borrower has experienced cash flow problems on other projects which have led to payment delinquencies on this project 
the second relationship consists of vacant land pad sites to be developed for condominiums near branson  missouri totaling million

non interest income including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  non interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the million  or  decrease in non interest income was primarily the result of the impairment write down in value of certain available for sale equity investments and lower commission revenue from the company s travel and investment divisions  partially offset by an increase in income related to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits 
the impairment write down totaled million on a pre tax basis including million related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock  which was discussed in the september   quarterly report on form q 
these equity investments have experienced significant fair value declines over the past year 
it is unclear if or when the values of these investment securities will improve  or whether such values will deteriorate further 
based on these developments  the company recorded an other than temporary impairment 
the company continues to hold these securities in the available for sale category 
the company also recorded an impairment write down of million on a pre tax basis in for the year ended december   commission income from the company s travel  insurance and investment divisions decreased million  or  compared to part of this decrease  was in the investment division as a result of the alliance formed with ameriprise financial services through penney  murray and associates 
as a result of this change  great southern now records most of its investment services activity on a net basis in non interest income 
thus  non interest expense related to the investment services division is also reduced 
the company s travel division also experienced a decrease in commission income of  in compared to customers are reducing their travel as a result of current economic conditions 
a significant increase in non interest income was due to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits  which resulted in an increase of million in the year ended december   and an increase of million in the year ended december  income of this magnitude related to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in the fair value of hedged deposits should not be expected in future years 
this income is part of a accounting restatement in which approximately million net of taxes was charged against retained earnings in this charge has been and continues to be recovered in subsequent periods as interest rate swaps matured or were terminated by the swap counterparty 
in the first quarter of  the interest rate swap counterparties have elected to exercise the call options on the remaining callable swaps and the company has elected to redeem the related certificates of deposit

the tables below and elsewhere in this report excluding hedge accounting entries recorded for the and periods contain reconciliations of this information to the reported information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company believes that this non gaap financial information is useful in its internal management financial analyses and may also be useful to investors because the company believes that the exclusion of these items from the specified components of net income better reflect the company s underlying operating results during the periods indicated for the reasons described above 
the amortization of the deposit broker fee and the net change in fair value of interest rate swaps and related deposits may be volatile 
for example  if market interest rates decrease significantly  the interest rate swap counterparties may wish to terminate the swaps prior to their stated maturities 
if a swap is terminated  it is likely that the company would redeem the related deposit account at face value 
if the deposit account is redeemed  any unamortized broker fee associated with the deposit account must be written off to interest expense 
in addition  if the interest rate swap is terminated  there may be an income or expense impact related to the fair values of the swap and related deposit which were previously recorded in the company s financial statements

interest income for both loans and investment securities and other interest earning assets increased due to higher average balances 
interest income for investment securities and other interest earning assets also increased due to higher average rates of interest while loans experienced average rates of interest that were effectively unchanged 
interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to december   interest income on loans increased primarily due to higher average balances 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the higher average balance resulted principally from the bank s increased commercial and residential construction lending  commercial business lending and consumer lending 
the bank s commercial real estate and multi family residential average loan balances experienced small decreases  while one to four family residential average loan balances increased slightly during interest income on loans decreased  as the result of a slight reduction in average interest rates 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  average loan rates were generally similar in and  as a result of market rates of interest  primarily the prime rate of interest 
during the first half of  market interest rates increased  with the prime rate of interest increasing by the end of june a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
the company has a portfolio of prime based loans which have interest rate floors 
prior to  many of these loan rate floors were in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
during and  as market interest rates rose  many of these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of basis points 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of a negative basis point

partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
additionally  recent frb interest rate cuts subsequent to december   have impacted interest income and net interest income 
generally  a rate cut by the frb would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on interest income and net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as fed funds adjust 
this negative impact is expected to be offset over the following to day period  and subsequently is expected to have a positive impact  as the company s interest rates on deposits  borrowings and interest rate swaps should also reduce as a result of changes in interest rates by the frb  assuming normal credit  liquidity and competitive loan and deposit pricing pressures 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased as a result of higher average rates of interest during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income increased by million as a result of an increase in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  in  as principal balances on mortgage backed securities were paid down through prepayments and normal amortization  the company replaced a portion of these securities with variable rate mortgage backed securities primarily one year and hybrid arms which had a lower yield at the time of purchase relative to the fixed rate securities remaining in the portfolio 
as these securities reached interest rate reset dates in  their rates increased along with market interest rate increases 
approximately million will have interest rate resets at some time in  with the currently projected weighted average coupon rate decreasing approximately 
based on market interest rates at december  in addition  approximately million will have initial interest rate resets at some time in the actual amount of securities that will reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities is subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
the company has total variable rate mortgage backed securities of approximately million at december  in addition  the company also increased its portfolio of tax exempt securities issued by states and municipalities over the past two years from million at december  to million at december  these securities generally have coupon yields that are comparable to treasury market interest rates  however  the tax equivalent yield is higher 
interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in available for sale agency securities  where securities were needed for liquidity and pledging to deposit accounts under customer repurchase agreements and public fund deposits 
many of these agency securities are callable at the option of the issuer  so it is likely that  as market interest rates have declined  agency security balances will be reduced in total interest expense including the effects of the company s accounting change in for certain interest rate swaps  total interest expense increased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in interest expense on deposits of million  or  an increase in interest expense on short term borrowings of million  or  and an increase in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of million  or

average interest bearing demand balances were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
average non interest bearing demand balances were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense on deposits increased million as a result of an increase in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the average interest rates increased due to higher overall market rates of interest throughout and into as certificates of deposit matured in and the first half of  they were generally replaced with certificates bearing a higher rate of interest 
market rates of interest on new certificates began to increase in the latter half of through the first half of as the frb raised short term interest rates 
in  the company increased its balances of brokered certificates of deposit to fund a portion of its loan growth 
brokered certificates of deposit balances decreased million in  to million 
retail certificates of deposit increased million in  to million 
in addition  the company s interest rate swaps repriced higher in and in conjunction with the increases in market interest rates  specifically libor 
libor interest rates increased compared to federal funds rates in the last half of as a result of credit and liquidity concerns in financial markets 
these libor interest rates were elevated approximately basis points compared to historical averages versus the stated federal funds rate

market rates of interest on short term borrowings increased beginning in the middle of through early as the frb raised short term interest rates 
the frb began to lower short term interest rates in the latter portion of and has continued to lower these rates in the first two months of interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased  due to increases in average balances from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the average rate of interest on these subordinated debentures decreased slightly in as these liabilities pay a variable rate of interest that is indexed to libor 
in november  the company redeemed its trust preferred debentures which were issued in and replaced them with new trust preferred debentures 
these new debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at a rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
in july  the company issued additional trust preferred debentures 
these new debentures are also not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at a rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income including the impact of the accounting entries recorded for certain interest rate swaps  net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was in the year ended december   compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
this margin decrease was caused by several factors 
for the years ended december   and  interest income was reduced million and  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
another factor that negatively impacted net interest income and net interest margin in  was the increase in the spread between libor interest rates compared to federal funds rates in the last half of as a result of credit and liquidity concerns in financial markets 
these libor interest rates were elevated approximately basis points compared to historical averages versus the stated federal funds rate 
the company has interest rate swaps and other borrowings that are indexed to libor  thereby causing increased funding costs 
these relative higher libor interest rates have declined to more normal levels in additionally  recent frb interest rate cuts have impacted net interest income 
generally  a rate cut by the frb would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as fed funds adjust 
this negative impact is expected to be offset over the following to day period  and subsequently is expected to have a positive impact  as the company s interest rates on deposits  borrowings and interest rate swaps should also reduce as a result of changes in interest rates by the frb  assuming normal credit  liquidity and competitive loan and deposit pricing pressures 
the company s overall interest rate spread decreased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the decrease was due to a basis point increase in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin decreased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis point while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets increased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits increased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances increased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings decreased basis points  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased basis points

the allowance for loan losses decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in versus million in the increases in charge offs and foreclosed assets were due to general market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects 
as properties were transferred into foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on recent internal and external reviews of the company s loan portfolio and current economic conditions

current projections by the company indicate that a positive return on the investment is expected once the space is leased 
a million loan relationship  which is secured by a restaurant building in northwest arkansas 
the company has begun foreclosure on this property 
a million loan relationship  which was described in the march   quarterly report on form q

a million loan relationship  which is secured by partially developed subdivision lots in northwest arkansas 
the company has begun foreclosure proceedings 
at december   eight significant loan relationships accounted for million of the total non performing loan balance of million 
in addition to the five relationships noted above  three other loan relationships were previously included in non performing loans and remained there at december  these relationships were described in the december   annual report on form k  and in previous quarterly reports on form q 
one of these relationships  a million loan on a nursing home in the state of missouri  was paid off in the first quarter of upon the sale of the facility 
the company had previously recorded a charge to the allowance for loan losses regarding this relationship and recovered approximately  to the allowance upon receipt of the loan payoff 
the other two unrelated relationships totaled million and million  respectively 
both of these relationships are secured primarily by single family houses and residential subdivision lots 
the million relationship has been foreclosed upon and transferred to foreclosed assets at a book value of  after a charge off to the allowance for loan losses of  the company is in process of foreclosing on the million relationship and is currently determining what  if any  charge off to the allowance for loan losses is needed regarding this relationship 
two other significant relationships were both added to the non performing loans category and subsequently transferred to foreclosed assets during the year ended december  a million loan relationship  described in the june   quarterly report on form q  which is secured by two residential developments in the kansas city  mo  metropolitan area 
at the time of the transfer to foreclosed assets  the asset was reduced to million through a charge off to the allowance for loan losses 
a million loan relationship  which was described in the june   quarterly report on form q

these five significant relationships remain in foreclosed assets at december   and are described below 
at december   five separate relationships totaled million  or  of the total foreclosed assets balance 
these five relationships include a million relationship  which involves a motel in the state of illinois 
as discussed above  the motel was sold in the first quarter at no additional loss to the company 
a million relationship  which involves residential developments in northwest arkansas 
one of the developments has some completed houses and additional lots

a million relationship  which involves residential developments  primarily residential lots in three different subdivisions and undeveloped ground  in the branson  mo  area 
the company has been in contact with various developers to determine interest in the projects 
potential problem loans 
potential problem loans increased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans increased primarily due to the addition of six unrelated relationships totaling million to the potential problem loans category 
four of these relationships involve residential construction and development loans 
two relationships are in springfield  mo  and total million and million  respectively  one relationship near little rock  ark 
totals million  and one relationship in the st 
louis area totals million 
this st 
louis area relationship was foreclosed in the first quarter the company recorded a loan charge off of million at the time of transfer to foreclosed assets based upon updated valuations of the assets 
the company is pursuing collection efforts against the guarantors on this credit

during the first quarter of  performance on the relationship improved and the company obtained additional collateral 
at december   two other large unrelated relationships were included in the potential problem loan category 
both of these relationships were included in the potential problem loan category at december  the first relationship totaled million at december   and was reduced to million at december   through the sale of houses and townhomes 
the relationship is secured primarily by a retail center  developed and undeveloped residential subdivisions  and single family houses being constructed for resale in the springfield  missouri  area 
the second relationship totaled million and is secured primarily by a motel in the state of florida 
the motel is operating but payment performance has been slow at times 
at december   these eight significant relationships described above accounted for million of the potential problem loan total 
non interest income including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  non interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the  or  decrease in non interest income was primarily the result of the impairment write down in value of one available for sale freddie mac preferred stock security 
this write down totaled million 
this security has an interest rate that resets to a market index every months and currently yields a tax equivalent interest rate of about 
the security has had unrealized gains and losses from time to time 
these unrealized gains and losses were recorded directly to equity in prior periods  so this other than temporary write down did not affect total equity 
throughout the first ten months of  as expected  the fair value of the security increased as market interest rates fell 
however  in november and december the value of this security declined sharply due to the credit and capital concerns faced by many financial services companies  including government sponsored enterprises freddie mac and fannie mae 
freddie mac and fannie mae have recently issued new perpetual preferred stock at higher yields than this security and that has also driven the value down for many of the previously issued preferred stocks 
the company has the ability to continue to hold this security in its portfolio for the foreseeable future and believes that the fair value of this security may recover from the current level in future periods  if and when credit and capital concerns subside for these government sponsored enterprises 
other items of non interest income in increased  compared to  primarily as a result of higher revenue from commissions and deposit account charges  partially offset by lower fees on loans 
for the year ended december   service charges on deposit accounts and atm fees increased  or  compared to due to the increase in deposit accounts

louis travel agency in the first quarter of and internal growth 
total late charges and fees on loans decreased  in the year ended december   compared to the same period in due primarily to the early repayment of five unrelated loans that triggered total prepayment fees of  in the year ended december  although the company does receive prepayment fees from time to time  it is difficult to forecast when and in what amounts these fees will be collected 
non interest income increased million in the year ended december   and increased million in the year ended december   as a result of the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits 
see item selected consolidated financial data restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the current and previously reported financial statements due to the company s accounting change for certain interest rate swaps in other income in and includes the net benefits realized on federal historic tax credits utilized by the company in both and the company expects to utilize federal historic tax credits in the future  however  the timing and amount of these credits will vary depending upon availability of the credits and ability of the company to utilize the credits

due to the increases in levels of foreclosed assets  foreclosure related expenses in were higher than by approximately  net of income received on foreclosed assets 
as previously disclosed in the company s filings for the fourth quarter and full year  these periods included an expense item of   after tax  which was a non cash write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the redemption of the cumulative trust preferred securities of great southern capital trust i

the company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities during each of these same time periods 
cash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the statements of cash flows have been primarily related to changes in accrued and deferred assets  credits and other liabilities  the provision for loan losses  charges related to other than temporary impairments of invesetment securities  depreciation  and the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and discounts premiums on loans and investments  all of which are non cash or non operating adjustments to operating cash flows

the number of shares of stock repurchased and the price paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is negative 
generally  a rate increase by the frb which does not appear likely in the near term based on current economic conditions would be expected to have an immediate negative impact on great southern s net interest income 
as the federal funds rate is now very low  the company s interest rate floors have been reached on most of its prime rate loans 
in addition  great southern has elected to leave its great southern prime rate at for those loans that are indexed to great southern prime rather than wall street journal prime 
while these interest rate floors and prime rate adjustments have helped keep the rate on our loan portfolio higher in this very low interest rate environment  they will also reduce the positive effect to our loan rates when market interest rates  specifically the prime rate  begin to increase 
the interest rate on these loans will not increase until the loan floors are reached and the wall street journal prime interest rate exceeds 
the operating environment has not been normal and interest cost for deposits and borrowings have been and continue to be elevated because of abnormal credit  liquidity and competitive pricing pressures  therefore we expect the net interest margin will continue to be somewhat compressed 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
the company has entered into interest rate swap derivatives  primarily as an asset liability management strategy  in order to hedge the change in the fair value from recorded fixed rate liabilities long term fixed rate cds 
the terms of the swaps are carefully matched to the terms of the underlying hedged item and when the relationship is properly documented as a hedge and proven to be effective  it is designated as a fair value hedge
