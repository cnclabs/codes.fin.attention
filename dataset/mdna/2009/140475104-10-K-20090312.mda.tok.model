during  the company announced that a special committee of its board of directors the special committee had engaged banc of america securities llc bas as its financial advisor to assist the special committee in exploring and considering a range of strategic alternatives for the company that would enhance shareholder value 
bas is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with expertise in the senior living industry and is prominent in both healthcare and real estate 
the strategic alternatives explored by bas included the following considerations a a sale of the company for cash or stock  b a going private transaction  c a restructuring of the company s portfolio  which may include sales and or acquisitions of assets  d a merger with a private company in which the company s stockholders may or may not retain a majority equity interest in the surviving entity  e the institution of a share buyback or dividend recurring or extraordinary  f the execution of the company s existing business plan without alteration  and g any other alternative or combination of alternatives that has the potential to enhance shareholder value 
subsequent to december   the special committee recommended  and the company s board of directors approved  the implementation of a stock repurchase program of up to million of the company s common stock 
under the stock repurchase program  the company is authorized to repurchase shares of its common stock in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and extent to which the company may repurchase its shares of common stock will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations

the strategic alternatives review process has not led to a material modification in the operational direction of the company or a change in management style or intent 
the senior living industry has been negatively impacted by unfavorable conditions in the housing  credit and financial markets and by deteriorating conditions in the overall economy  generally resulting in lower than anticipated occupancy rates

for communities owned by joint ventures and third parties  the company typically receives a management fee of of gross revenues 
in addition  certain of the contracts provide for supplemental incentive fees that vary by contract based upon the financial performance of the managed community 
the company believes that the factors affecting the financial performance of communities managed under contracts with third parties do not vary substantially from the factors affecting the performance of owned and leased communities  although there are different business risks associated with these activities 
the company s third party management fees are primarily based on a percentage of gross revenues 
as a result  the cash flow and profitability of such contracts to the company are more dependent on the revenues generated by such communities and less dependent on net cash flow than for owned communities

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition resident and health care revenue is recognized at estimated net realizable amounts  based on historical experiences  due from residents in the period to which the rental and other services are provided 
revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for approximately of the company s revenue in fiscal  and six communities are providers of services under medicaid programs 
accordingly  the communities are entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that are lower than private pay rates 
patient service revenue for medicaid patients is recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates are set prospectively by the state upon the filing of an annual cost report 
two communities are providers of services under the medicare program and are entitled to payment under the foregoing programs in amounts determined based on rates established by the federal government 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing 
while no such regulatory inquiries have been made  compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines  penalties  and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs

the company periodically reevaluates assets held for sale to determine if the assets are still recorded at the lower of fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value 
the company has one parcel of land classified as held for sale at december  the fair value of this property is generally determined based on market rates  industry trends and recent comparable sales transactions 
the actual sales price of this asset could differ significantly from the company s estimate 
lease accounting the company determines whether to account for its leases as either operating  capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of the lease agreement

the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such 
table of contents asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value  generally based on discounted cash flows  of the long lived asset 
the company analyzed certain long lived assets with operating losses  under the undiscounted cash flow method  for impairment

under fin  the company is required to recognize a tax benefit in its financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that its position is more likely than not ie  a greater than percent likelihood to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance  if considered necessary  based on such evaluation 
the company s policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense 
the company has evaluated future expectations of net income and various tax planning strategies that it believes are both prudent and feasible including various strategies to utilize net built in gains on the company s appreciated assets 
the company believes based upon this analysis that the realization of the net deferred tax asset is reasonably assured and therefore has not provided for a valuation allowance
