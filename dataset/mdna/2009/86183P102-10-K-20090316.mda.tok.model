our increase in net sales was predominantly attributable to net new business sales 
this increase was partially offset by volume reductions and contractual price reductions at our major customers in the automotive vehicle market for the year ended december  our net loss was due to a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million and a non cash deferred tax asset valuation of million 
we achieved income from continuing operations excluding restructuring  the effect of the goodwill impairment charge and the deferred tax asset valuation allowance other non recurring items in of million  or per share  compared with million  or per share  in we aggressively pursued restructuring efforts starting in late and during to adjust the cost structure and eliminate overhead centers to enhance profitability in robust economic times and protect profitability when market adversity occurs

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and sfas  accounting for income taxes  the results also include an after tax non cash goodwill impairment charge in our control device reporting segment of million  or per share  and a non cash valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million or per share 
the impact of the non cash impairment charge and deferred tax asset valuation allowance was driven by adverse equity market conditions that caused a decrease in current market multiples and our stock price as of december  affecting our profitability were restructuring initiatives that began in the fourth quarter of to improve the company s manufacturing efficiency and cost position by ceasing manufacturing operations at our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  united kingdom locations

restructuring expenses that were general and administrative in nature were included in the company s consolidated statements of operations as restructuring charges  while the remaining restructuring related expenses were included in cost of goods sold 
in  our pst eletr nica sa pst joint venture in brazil  which is an electronic system provider focused on security and convenience applications primarily for the vehicle and motorcycle industry  continued to perform well  resulting in equity earnings of million compared to million in the previous year 
we also received dividend payments from pst of million and million in and  respectively 
we currently hold a equity interest in pst 
the results of pst in will be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates

recent trends and market conditions the automotive and commercial vehicle industries experienced significantly unfavorable developments during primarily the second half of  particularly in north america and europe 
these trends include general economic factors disruptions in financial markets and restrictions on liquidity are adversely impacting the availability and cost of incremental credit for many companies 
these disruptions are also adversely affecting the global economy  further negatively impacting consumer spending patterns in the automotive and commercial vehicle industries 
our customers and suppliers are attempting to respond to rapidly changing consumer preferences  restricted liquidity and increased cost of capital any of which could negatively impact their business and could result in further restructuring or even reorganization or liquidation under bankruptcy laws 
any such negative event could  in turn  negatively affect our business either through loss of sales to our customers or through our inability to meet our commitments or inability to meet them without excess expense  due to the loss of supplies from any of our suppliers so affected 
production levels and product mix in the us and europe  overall negative economic conditions  including the deterioration of global financial markets  reduced credit availability and lower consumer confidence have significantly impacted the automotive and commercial vehicle industries 
as such  automotive and commercial vehicle production and sales have deteriorated substantially and are not expected to recover significantly in the near term 
therefore  considering the drastic changes to consumer demand for vehicles  and corresponding decrease in production and demand for our products  as well as are common share price  we tested our goodwill for impairment and recognized a pre tax non cash million goodwill impairment charge in in recent years  and continuing into  general motors  ford and chrysler detroit three have seen a steady decline in their market share for vehicle sales in north america 
declining market share  inherent legacy issues with the detroit three and the impact of declining consumer confidence have led to recent  unprecedented production cuts and permanent capacity reductions 
during  the detroit three north american production levels declined approximately compared to these declines will have a continuing negative impact on our sales  liquidity and results of operations 
in addition  in order to address market share declines  reduced production levels  negative industry trends such as change in mix of vehicles  general macroeconomic conditions and other structural issues specific to their companies such as significant overcapacity and pension and healthcare costs  the detroit three and certain of our other customers continue to implement or may implement various forms of restructuring initiatives including  in certain cases  reorganization under bankruptcy laws 
these restructuring actions have had and may continue to have a significant impact throughout our industry  including our supply base 
outlook in the fourth quarter of the north american automotive and the global commercial vehicle markets experienced the beginning of a significant decline that is unprecedented in its breadth  depth and speed 
it is currently accelerating into the first part of the uncertainty of the activity of the global economy makes it difficult to predict how demand for automotive and commercial vehicle products will develop in significant factors inherent to our markets that could affect our results for include general economic conditions and the financial stability of our customers and suppliers as well as our ability to successfully execute our planned restructuring  productivity and cost reduction initiatives 
we are undertaking these initiatives to mitigate significant sales volume reductions in our served markets and customer demanded price reductions 
our management team is focused on improving operational efficiency while adapting to the needs of our customers 
we continue our transition to low cost manufacturing locations 
initially  this initiative will result in restructuring costs stemming from facility closures and production relocations 
however  the longer term effects of such an initiative will enable us to reduce our operating costs and increase global sourcing capacity to our customers 
we will continue to monitor business conditions and will take the necessary steps to address the current economic environment 
results of operations we are primarily organized by markets served and products produced 
under this organizational structure  our operations have been aggregated into two reportable segments electronics and control devices 
the electronics reportable segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture electronic instrument clusters  electronic control units  driver information systems and electrical distribution systems  primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for electrical power and signal distribution 
the control devices reportable segment includes results from our operations that design and manufacture electronic and electromechanical switches  control actuation devices and sensors 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for our reportable segments  excluding inter segment sales  for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease electronics control devices total net sales the increase in net sales for our electronics segment was primarily due to new business sales and increased sales volume in contractual price reductions and foreign currency exchange rates negatively affected net sales by approximately million in the decrease in net sales for our control devices segment was primarily attributable to production volume reductions at our major customers in the north american automotive market 
additionally  the loss of sensor product revenue at our sarasota  florida  facility had a negative impact on net sales 
net sales by geographic location for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease north america europe and other total net sales the increase in north american sales was primarily attributable to net new business sales of electronics products 
the increase was partially offset by lower sales volume in our north american automotive market 
our decrease in sales outside north america was primarily due to reduced volume in light vehicle products and reduced european commercial vehicle sales volume 
consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and are presented in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase decrease net sales costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative gain on sale of property  plant equipment  net goodwill impairment charge restructuring charges operating income loss interest expense  net equity in earnings of investees loss on early extinguishment of debt other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss cost of goods sold

selling  general and administrative expenses 
product development expenses included in sg a were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily related to development spending in the areas of instrumentation and wiring 
the company intends to reallocate its resources to focus on the design and development of new products rather than primarily focusing on sustaining existing product programs 
the increase in sg a expenses  excluding product development was due primarily to increased compensation related items 
gain on sale of property  plant and equipment  net 
the gain for was primarily a result of selling manufacturing lines which was part of the line transfer initiative at our mitcheldean  united kingdom facility 
the gain for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the sale of non strategic assets including two idle facilities and the company airplane 
goodwill impairment charge 
a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded during the year ended december  during the fourth quarter  as a result of the deterioration of the global economy and its effects on the automotive and commercial vehicle markets  we were required to perform an additional goodwill impairment test subsequent to our annual october  test 
the result of the december  impairment test was that our goodwill was determined to be significantly impaired and was written off 
the goodwill related to two reporting units in the control devices segment 
restructuring charges 
the increase in restructuring charges that were general and administrative in nature  were primarily the result of the ratable recognition of one time termination benefits that were due to employees and the cancellation of certain contracts upon the closure of our sarasota  florida  and mitcheldean  united kingdom  locations 
additionally  in  we announced additional restructuring initiatives at our canton  massachusetts  orebro  sweden and tallinn  estonia locations 
the majority of this charge resulted in the recognition of one time termination benefits that were due to affected employees 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because the assets were transferred to our other locations for continued production 
restructuring expenses that were general and administrative in nature were included in the company s consolidated statements of operations as restructuring charges  while the remaining restructuring related expenses were included in cost of goods sold 
these initiatives were substantially completed in restructuring charges recorded by reportable segment during the year ended december  were as follows in thousands electronics control devices total consolidated restructuring charges severance costs contract termination costs other costs total restructuring charges severance costs relate to a reduction in workforce 
contract termination costs represent expenditures associated with long term lease obligations that were cancelled as part of the restructuring initiatives

restructuring charges recorded by reportable segment during the year ended december  were as follows in thousands electronics control devices total consolidated restructuring charges severance costs other costs total restructuring charges restructuring related expenses  general and administrative in nature  for the year ended december  were primarily severance costs as a result of the ratable recognition of one time termination benefits that were due to employees upon the closure of our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  united kingdom locations that were announced in equity in earnings of investees 
the increase was predominately attributable to the increase in equity earnings recognized from our pst joint venture 
the increase primarily reflects higher volume for pst s security product lines and favorable exchange rates throughout most of income loss before income taxes 
income loss before income taxes is summarized in the following table by reportable segment in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease electronics control devices other corporate activities corporate interest expense income loss before income taxes the increase in income before income taxes in the electronics segment was related to higher net sales  which increased by million in this was partially offset by increased restructuring related expenses of million in when compared to the decrease in income before income taxes in the control devices reportable segment was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million recognized in additionally  net sales reduced by million and the segment recognized an additional million of restructuring related expenses in the increase in income before income taxes from other corporate activities was primarily due to an increase in equity earnings from our pst joint venture of million in income loss before income taxes by geographic location for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  decrease decrease north america europe and other income loss before income taxes our north american profitability was adversely affected by the million goodwill impairment charge  which was offset by new business sales of electronic products 
other factors impacting the results were increased restructuring related expenses of million and lower north american automotive production 
the decrease in profitability outside north america was primarily due to increased restructuring related expenses of million and design and development expenses 
the decrease was partially offset by increased european commercial vehicle production during the first half of provision for income taxes 
we recognized a provision for income taxes of million  or of pre tax loss  and million  or of pre tax income  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for was primarily attributable to the recording of a valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets 
due to the impairment of goodwill the company was in a cumulative loss position for the period pursuant to the accounting guidance the company was required to record a valuation allowance 
additionally  the effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by the costs incurred to restructure our united kingdom operations 
since we do not believe that the related tax benefit of those losses will be realized  a valuation allowance was recorded against the foreign deferred tax assets associated with those foreign losses 
finally  offsetting the impact of the current year valuation allowances  the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a combination of audit settlements  successful litigation and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for our reportable segments  excluding inter segment sales  for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease electronics control devices total net sales the decrease in net sales for our electronics segment was primarily due to a substantial decline in medium and heavy duty truck production in north america 
medium and heavy duty truck production in was unfavorably impacted by the new diesel emissions regulations that were implemented on january  in the us offsetting the unfavorable impact of the new diesel emissions standards were new program revenues in north america and europe  increased production volume in our european commercial vehicle operations and favorable foreign currency exchange 
favorable foreign currency exchange rates contributed million to net sales for the year ended december  the increase in net sales for our control devices segment was primarily attributable to new product launches in our temperature and speed sensor businesses 
the increase was partially offset by production volume reductions at our major automotive customers 
net sales by geographic location for the years ended december  and are summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase decrease decrease north america europe and other total net sales the decrease in north american sales was primarily attributable to lower sales to our commercial vehicle customers as a result of lower demand because of the new us diesel emission regulations and lower production volume from our north american light vehicle customers 
the decrease was partially offset by sales related to new program launches of sensor products and new electronic products supplied for the production of military vehicles 
our increase in sales outside of north america for the year was primarily due to increased production volume  new product revenues and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates affected net sales outside north america by million for the year ended december  consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  and are presented in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase decrease net sales costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative gain on sale of property  plant and equipment  net restructuring charges operating income interest expense  net equity in earnings of investees other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income cost of goods sold 
the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was due to increased sales volume from new business awards  ongoing procurement initiatives and favorable product mix

selling  general and administrative expenses 
product development expenses included in sg a were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase related to development spending in the areas of tachographs and instrumentation 
the increase in sg a expenses  excluding product development expenses  in compared with was primarily attributable to the increase in our selling and marketing activity to support new products in europe  the increase in systems implementation expenses related to a new information system in europe  and a million one time gain in the third quarter of related to the settlement of the life insurance benefits portion of a postretirement plan 
restructuring charges 
the increase in restructuring charges was primarily the result of one time termination benefits related to the restructuring initiatives announced in to improve manufacturing efficiency and cost position by ceasing manufacturing operations at our sarasota  florida and mitcheldean  united kingdom locations 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because assets are primarily being transferred to our other locations for continued production 
restructuring charges recorded by reportable segment during the year ended december  were as follows in thousands electronics control devices total consolidated restructuring charges severance costs other costs total restructuring charges also included in severance costs for the electronics reporting segment in was million of expense related to the rationalization of certain manufacturing facilities in europe and north america announced in these restructuring initiatives were completed in restructuring charges recorded by reportable segment during the year ended december  were as follows in thousands electronics control devices total consolidated restructuring charges severance costs other costs total restructuring charges severance costs related to a reduction in workforce 
other associated costs include miscellaneous expenditures associated with exiting business activities 
gain on sale of property  plant and equipment  net 
the increase was primarily attributable to a gain on the sale of two closed facilities during exceeding the gain on the sale of land during the first quarter of equity in earnings of investees 
the increase in equity earnings from investees was predominately attributable to the increase in equity earnings recognized from our pst joint venture in brazil 
the increase primarily reflects higher volume for pst s security product lines 
income before income taxes 
income before income taxes is summarized in the following table by reportable segment in thousands for the years ended december  increase decrease electronics control devices other corporate activities corporate interest expense income before income taxes the decrease in income before income taxes in the electronics segment was related to reduced volume and increased sg a expenses 
the increased sg a expenses were predominantly due to increased development spending in the areas of tachographs and instrumentation and higher selling and marketing costs associated with new product introductions 
the increase in income before income taxes in the control devices reportable segment was primarily due to increased sales volume and new product launches 
these factors were offset by operating inefficiencies related to a new product launch 
the increase in income before income taxes from other corporate activities was primarily due to a reduction in foreign exchange losses recorded in the previous year and an increase in equity earnings from our pst joint venture of million 
income before income taxes by geographic location for the years ended december  and is summarized in the following table in thousands for the years ended december  increase increase north america europe and other income before income taxes the increase in our profitability in north america was primarily attributable to increased revenue from new sensor product launches and new electronic products supplied for the production of military vehicles

the increase in our profitability outside north america was primarily due to increased european commercial vehicle production and revenue from new program launches 
the increase was offset by higher sg a related to increased development spending in the areas of tachographs and instrumentation and higher selling and marketing costs associated with new product introductions 
provision for income taxes 
we recognized a provision for income taxes of million  or of pre tax income  and million  or of pre tax income  for federal  state and foreign income taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the increase in higher taxed domestic earnings and the increase over the prior year of the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in the united kingdom 
these increases were partially offset by a deferred tax benefit related to a change in state tax law 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flows in thousands for the years ended december  increase decrease cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net change in cash and cash equivalents the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower accounts receivable balances in the current year 
the increase in net cash used for investing activities reflects an increase in cash used for capital projects 
the increase was due in part to the expansion of our lexington facility during in addition  net cash used for investing activities includes the proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets  including two idle facilities and the company airplane 
the increase in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to cash used to purchase and retire million in par value of the company s senior notes during as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the purpose of these investments is to reduce exposure related to our british pound denominated receivables and mexican peso denominated payables 
at december   the company also used forward currency contracts to reduce the exposure related to the company s mexican peso and swedish krona denominated receivables 
the estimated fair value of the british pound contract at december  and  per quoted market sources  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair market value of the mexican peso denominated contracts at december   per quoted market sources  was approximately million 
for the year ended december   we recognized a million gain related to foreign currency contracts in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of other expense income  net 
as discussed in note  we entered into a fixed price swap contract in december for million pounds of copper  which lasted through december in september  we entered into a fixed price swap contract for million pounds of copper  which will last from january to december the purpose of these contracts is to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
as of december  and  the fair value of the fixed price commodity swap contract  per quoted market sources  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments  as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases employee benefit plans total contractual obligations our capital expenditures are expected to be slightly lower than our expenditures  due to lower expected demand in the markets that we serve 
management will continue to focus on reducing its weighted average cost of capital and believes that cash flows from operations and the availability of funds from our asset based credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our future growth and operating needs 
we will continue to monitor business conditions and will take the necessary steps to ensure our position in the current economic environment 
as outlined in note to our consolidated financial statements  our asset based credit facility  permits borrowing up to a maximum level of million 
this facility provides us with lower borrowing rates and allows us the flexibility to refinance our outstanding debt 
at december   there were no borrowings on this asset based credit facility 
the available borrowing capacity on this credit facility is based on eligible current assets  as defined 
at december  and  the company had borrowing capacity of million and million  respectively  based on eligible current assets 
the decrease in borrowing capacity was due primarily to lower accounts receivable balances 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december as of december   the company s million senior notes were redeemable at 
given the company s senior notes are redeemable  we may seek to retire the senior notes through a redemption  cash purchases  open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such redemptions  purchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
during  we have purchased and retired million in face value of our senior notes 
inflation and international presence given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity prices  we believe that an increase in such items could significantly affect our profitability 
furthermore  by operating internationally  we are affected by foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions of certain countries 
based on the current economic conditions in these countries  we believe we are not significantly exposed to adverse exchange rate risk or economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on authorized returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is our obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses immediately 
there were no such instances in these agreements generally may also be terminated by our customers at any time 
on an ongoing basis  we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers  which include pricing terms 
purchase orders do not always specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content  the cost of our products and other commercial factors 
such pricing adjustments are recognized as they are negotiated with our customers 
warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims 
to estimate the warranty reserve  we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
although we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have concentrations of sales and trade receivable balances with a few key customers 
therefore  it is critical that we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  we review historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
we do not have collateral requirements with our customers 
contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating that amount of probable loss 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for us inventories and by the first in  first out fifo method for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the valuation methodologies employed by the company use subjective measures including forward looking financial information and discount rates that directly impact the resulting fair values used to test the company s business units for impairment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill 
share based compensation 
the estimate for our share based compensation expense involves a number of assumptions 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
we estimate volatility and forfeitures based on historical data  future expectations and the expected term of the share based compensation awards 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense could have varied 
pension benefits 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels and mortality rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the expected long term return on assets is determined as a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class held by the defined benefit pension plan at the date 
the expected return on bonds has been based on the yield available on similar bonds by currency  issuer and duration at that date 
the expected return on equities is based on an equity risk premium of return above that available on long term government bonds of a similar duration and the same currency as the liabilities 
discount rates for our defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom are determined using the weighted average long term sterling aa corporate bond 
on december   the yield was approximately deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations 
our deferred tax assets include  among other items  net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods 
these deferred tax assets will begin to expire  if unused  no later than and  respectively 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and in making this evaluation  the company considers available positive and negative evidence  including past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent periods  our forecast of taxable income for the current year and future years and tax planning strategies 
risk factors include the continuing deterioration in economic conditions in the us automotive and commercial vehicle markets of which the company has significant us operations and higher than planned volume or price reductions from key customers 
during the fourth quarter of this year  we concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
as a result we provided a full valuation allowance  net of certain future reversing taxable temporary differences  in the amount of million with respect to our us deferred tax assets 
to the extent that realization of a portion or all of the tax assets becomes more likely than not to be realized based on changes in circumstances a reversal of that portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be recorded 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  which are deemed permanently reinvested 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended  in accounting for financial instruments 
under sfas  the gain or loss on derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability  as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item  are recognized in net earnings during the period of the change in fair values 
for derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify as hedges of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  the gain or loss on the derivative is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive earnings and reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations when the hedged transaction affects net earnings 
any gain or loss on the derivative in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item is recognized on the consolidated statement of operations during the period of change 
restructuring 
we have recorded restructuring charges in the recent period in connection with improving manufacturing efficiency and cost position by transferring production to other locations 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
also in connection with this initiative  we recorded liabilities for severance costs 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because assets are primarily being transferred to our other locations for continued production 
estimates for work force reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information as necessary 
management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the initial estimate 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report

forward looking statements may be identified by the words will  may  designed to  believes  plans  expects  continue  and similar words and expressions 
the forward looking statements in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include  among other factors the loss or bankruptcy of a major customer  the costs and timing of facility closures  business realignment  or similar actions  a significant change in medium and heavy duty  agricultural  automotive or off highway vehicle production  our ability to achieve cost reductions that offset or exceed customer mandated selling price reductions  a significant change in general economic conditions in any of the various countries in which we operate  labor disruptions at our facilities or at any of our significant customers or suppliers  the ability of our suppliers to supply us with parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis  the amount of debt and the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facility  customer acceptance of new products  capital availability or costs  including changes in interest rates or market perceptions  the successful integration of any acquired businesses  the occurrence or non occurrence of circumstances beyond our control  and those items described in part i  item ia risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
at december   however  all of our debt was fixed rate debt 
at this time  we do not use financial instruments to manage this risk 
commodity price risk given the current economic climate and fluctuations in certain commodity costs throughout most of  we currently are experiencing an increased risk  particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  zinc  resins and certain other commodities 
we manage this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers 
we may also consider pursuing alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over a period of time 
the recent decline in certain commodity costs has positively affected our operating results  however an increase in certain commodity costs could adversely impact our profitability 
in december  we entered into a fixed price swap contract for million pounds of copper  which lasted through december in september  we entered into a fixed price swap contract for million pounds of copper  which will last from january to december the purpose of these contracts is to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
going forward  we believe that our mitigation efforts will offset a substantial portion of any financial impact caused by these costs increasing 
however  no assurances can be given that the magnitude or duration of any increased costs will not have a material impact on our future operating results 
a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in commodity prices would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk our risks related to foreign currency exchange rates have historically not been material  however  given the current economic climate  we are more closely monitoring this risk 
we use derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other foreign currency exposures 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the purpose of these foreign currency contracts is to reduce exposure related to the company s british pound denominated receivables 
at december   the company used forward currency contracts to reduce exposure to future mexico peso denominated purchases 
at december   the company also used forward currency contracts to reduce the exposure related to swedish krona denominated receivables 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december  and  per quoted market sources  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s foreign currency option contracts expire throughout we do not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million and million or million for the company s british pound denominated receivables and for the company s mexican peso denominated receivables  respectively  as of december  for foreign currency contracts outstanding at december   a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million as of december  it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
therefore  a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted foreign currencies would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
