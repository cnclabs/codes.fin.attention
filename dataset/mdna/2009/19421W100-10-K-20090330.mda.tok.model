we do so by building and leveraging deep consumer insights that will allow us to continually anticipate trends and increase our relevance to our consumers lifestyles

in addition  we plan to continue to grow our portfolio of brands through internal development  licensing and acquisition

the company used cash on hand to fund the 
table of contents acquisition of collective licensing and the proceeds from a million term loan as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisition of stride rite 
payless payless operates over  retail stores in countries and territories in north america  the caribbean  central america  and south america 
in the third quarter of  we opened our first stores in colombia and announced plans for further international expansion to the middle east through a franchising agreement 
our franchisor plans to open stores in our mission is to democratize fashion and design in footwear and accessories 
payless sells a broad assortment of quality footwear  including athletic  casual and dress shoes  sandals  work and fashion boots  slippers  and accessories such as handbags and hosiery

stores sell footwear under brand names including airwalk  american eagle  champion and dexter 
select stores also currently sell exclusive designer lines of footwear and accessories under names including abaete for payless  lela rose for payless  and alice olivia for payless 
payless seeks to compete effectively by bringing to market differentiated  trend right merchandise before mass market discounters and at the same time as department and specialty retailers but at a more compelling value 
payless is comprised of two reporting segments  payless domestic and payless international 
the payless strategy focuses on four key elements on trend  targeted product  effective brand marketing  a great shopping experience  and efficient operations 
by offering on trend targeted product  we successfully build a connection with our customers 
we interpret fashion trends timely and translate this into on trend product in our stores through an extensive due diligence process 
beginning about a year in advance  we review key fashion markets worldwide 
we employ trend services and examine the industry s ready to wear forecasts  then  we test product 
by doing so  we gain valuable intelligence well in advance of the seasons arrival 
we refine our ideas  commit to a product assortment  and display that assortment in our stores at about the same time as other fashion oriented higher priced competitors 
customers demand on trend products  but have different definitions of what that means 
importantly  we believe merchandise can be on trend at a great value 
customers will always find tiered pricing at payless with good better best price points 
through elements of promotion and pricing tiers  we strive to maintain market share with budget oriented shoppers while driving the opportunity to increase market share with expressive customers 
the next component of the payless strategy is brand marketing effectiveness  and the development of a house of brands architecture 
we are building  licensing and buying appropriate authentic and aspirational brands to appeal to our major customer segments 
as we continue to increase the proportion of branded footwear in our assortment  we will have more pricing flexibility to increase the average selling price per unit 
the results of our branded programs validate our strategy and demonstrate that we have additional expansion opportunities ahead 
we are also creating a great shopping experience through improved store operations execution 
our passionate and skilled store teams offer friendly helpful service 
in addition  our hot zone store design improves our ability to showcase our merchandise  improve the in store experience for our customers  and further support the payless brand identity 
our hot zone design features attractive gondolas and tables with product featured by style in the front of the store  while maintaining the traditional shopping experience by size in the back of the store 
hot zone will be the design for our remodels  new stores  and relocations as we move forward 
the last major component of our payless strategy is improving the efficiency of our operations 
our new distribution center model allows us to better service our customer base in the united states  which is located predominately on the nation s coasts and borders 
the distribution center investments are intended to improve speed to market and replenishment of product for our stores 
the distribution center initiative will also reduce our disaster recovery and business interruption risk 
we opened our west coast distribution center in california in the second quarter of and opened another distribution center in ohio in the fourth quarter of once both new distribution centers are operating satisfactorily  we plan to close our current facility in topeka  kansas  which is expected to be in the second quarter of we also plan on incorporating some of stride rite s operations into payless distribution network by shifting distribution from stride rite s huntington  indiana distribution center to our brookville  ohio distribution center 
stride rite stride rite is one of the leading marketers of high quality men s  women s and children s footwear 
stride rite was founded on the strength of the stride rite children s brand  but today includes a portfolio of brands addressing different markets within the footwear industry 
stride rite is predominantly a wholesaler of footwear  selling its products mostly in north america in a wide variety of retail formats including premier department stores  independent shoe stores  value retailers and specialty stores 
stride rite markets products in countries outside north america through owned operations  independent distributors and licensees 
stride rite also markets its products directly to consumers by selling children s footwear through its 
table of contents stride rite retail stores and by selling all of its brands through stride rite outlet stores and through e commerce 
in total  stride rite operates over retail locations 
stride rite is comprised of two operating segments  stride rite retail and stride rite wholesale 
the stride rite retail stores are one of the largest premium retailers of children s non athletic shoes 
stride rite has over years of expertise in the development of children s shoes 
most of the stride rite brand s sales come from its plus retail stores  which account for approximately thousand square feet of retail space 
the rest of the brand s sales come from a variety of channels including department stores and licensed dealers 
stride rite is currently merchandised and marketed at premium price points primarily for consumers up to six years of age 
one of the elements of our stride rite brand strategy is to expand our market to older children 
we intend to build upon stride rite s position as the premier brand in children s footwear 
we also continue to build sperry top sider and keds into nautical lifestyle and athletic lifestyle brands  respectively  and to leverage saucony s authentic running heritage to build a greater global athletic and lifestyle footwear and apparel business 
sperry top sider sperry is a brand with a powerful heritage in the boat shoe category 
our strategy for the sperry brand is centered primarily on expanding beyond boat shoes  driving its women s business and expanding internationally 
we have created new footwear products in the dress casual  casual and performance markets 
we are also building upon our early success in women s a larger footwear market than our core men s target market 
new women s products are multi generational  year round  and distributed at a broad array of retail channels 
international growth trends are to be strengthened by focusing on specific markets with the best opportunities  adding resources to our international infrastructure  and leveraging us marketing and imagery 
the saucony brand strategy is focused on creating and delivering authentic technical running products  growing share in new and existing wholesale channels  and re establishing a product line known as saucony originals 
we are driving business with those who shop the specialty running channel by evolving and improving our designs 
we offer an array of award winning products specifically engineered with emphasis on different levels of performance including stability  cushioning  and motion control 
our saucony products are expected to be compelling due to improved technical design  aesthetic design  and broader pricing 
in addition  we have launched an apparel line focused on the specialty running channel 
keds is an iconic american brand 
the strategy to grow this brand is predicated upon executing opportunities related to keds consumer  product  distribution  and operations 
the keds target consumer is a woman up to twenty four years old 
we believe twenty four years old is an age that many potential and existing keds consumers aspire to be in their lifestyles 
key events the significant challenges facing the global economy in and the highly uncertain global economic outlook have adversely affected consumer confidence and spending levels 
we believe that these conditions are likely to persist throughout these conditions  along with severe credit market disruptions  among other factors  have also adversely affected the global footwear retailing industry 
to mitigate this impact  we plan to continue to focus on reaching customers with new styles at compelling prices with great service 
in addition  we are managing inventory very closely  flowing seasonal product closer to the time it is worn  and executing a number of gross margin driving initiatives 
we are also allocating our capital more heavily towards investments which have higher financial returns  such as our international business 
finally  we intend to reduce our operating cost structure through a series of continuous improvement initiatives which focus on reducing costs and increasing cash flow 
these include occupancy cost rationalization  prudent marketing and advertising spending  renegotiating procurement contracts and re examining existing contracts for cost reduction opportunities  and establishing new processes in merchandise sourcing that more effectively utilize factory capacity and ensure the best pricing 
see item a risk factors for a further discussion of the potential impact of the weak economy on our financial position and results of operations 
we are experiencing inflationary pressures in china  where the majority of our products are made 
these pressures are exacerbated by a weak us dollar 
we are working to control costs by partnering with our factories on opportunities for production further inland and north in china and other countries such as indonesia and india  as well as expanding our existing presence in vietnam 
we believe we will be able to manage cost by using a number of initiatives such as more direct sourcing and the consolidation of raw material suppliers and factories 
in addition  with the current development of lower crude oil prices and the stabilization of the us dollar  we expect to see a softening of inflationary pressure for as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  we are currently involved in litigation with adidas america  inc and adidas salomon ag collectively  adidas  crocs  inc  american eagle outfitters  inc and others in the ordinary course of business 
on may   a jury returned a verdict against us in the aggregate amount of million in connection with our litigation with adidas 
on september  the court reduced the monetary award to million and 
table of contents on march   the court entered a supplemental judgment of approximately million that increases the total award to approximately million 
we believe that the verdict and resulting judgment were excessive  unjustified and the product of legal error 
as described under legal proceedings herein  although we are expeditiously taking steps to protect our legal rights  there can be no assurances that our efforts will be successful 
the jury verdict and judgment in our litigation with adidas have negatively impacted our business and we expect the negative impacts to continue until the matter is finally resolved 
our litigation with adidas has occupied a significant amount of management time and resources 
since the entry of the jury verdict  management s time commitment and the related expenses  including the expenses associated with outside advisors  have increased and are expected to continue until the litigation is finally resolved 
we are also subject to an injunction preventing us from selling certain two and four striped shoes 
the injunction could adversely affect our financial results if we are not able to find suitable replacements to sell in our stores 
see item a risk factors for a further discussion of the risks to our business resulting from our litigation with adidas 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax loss in connection with our adidas litigation 
this loss  which was recorded within cost of sales on our consolidated statement of earnings  resulted in an equal amount being recorded in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheet 
the likelihood of further losses and the ultimate amount of any such losses are not reasonably determinable at this time  however  the actual resolution of our litigation may result in a reversal of the loss or further losses  which could be significant and could materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the period in which those losses are recorded 
on june   we entered into a settlement agreement with k swiss inc k swiss to resolve our outstanding claims with them 
under the settlement agreement neither party admits liability to the other  however  we have paid k swiss million  which was recorded within cost of sales on our consolidated statement of loss earnings 
k swiss has given us a full release of all known or unknown claims with respect to any shoe advertised  marketed  or sold by payless or its affiliates up to june   including claims that were or could have been brought in the pending action 
under the settlement agreement  we have also agreed to refrain from making  advertising  promoting or selling footwear confusingly similar to that sold by k swiss  including footwear that bears k swiss trademark or trade dress and had until december  to sell any existing inventory of shoes whose sale would be precluded under the terms of the settlement agreement 
in  we incurred million of net pre tax expenses related to our litigation with adidas and k swiss 
this amount includes the million pre tax loss related to adidas and the million settlement paid to k swiss  as well as legal fees and other expenses related to both matters  partially offset by the impact of insurance recoveries 
in the fourth quarter of  due to weakening economic conditions combined with weaker than expected holiday sales  we revised our financial projections related to certain tradenames and reporting units 
as described in our critical accounting policies these revisions indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets and  as such  we assessed the fair value of these items to determine if their book value exceeded their fair value 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that the book value of certain indefinite lived tradenames and goodwill exceeded their fair value and we recognized million of pre tax impairment charges for our indefinite lived tradenames and million of pre tax impairment charges for goodwill 
in  we also incurred tangible asset impairment primarily for stores and other charges consisting of performance share unit cancellation and severance costs totaling million 
we also incurred million related to pre tax incremental costs resulting from the flow through of acquired inventory recorded at fair value purchased in the stride rite acquisition 
total pre tax charges related to key events are summarized by reporting segment in the table below payless stride rite stride rite in millions domestic retail wholesale total impairment of tradenames net litigation expenses impairment of goodwill tangible asset impairment and other charges costs resulting from the flow through of acquired inventory recorded at fair value impairment of goodwill is recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of loss earnings

total exit costs are currently estimated to be approximately million  consisting of approximately million of non cash accelerated depreciation expenses  approximately million for employee severance expenses  and approximately million related to contract termination and other exit costs 
the exit costs are recorded as costs of sales within the payless segment in the consolidated statement of loss earnings 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
the significant components of the exit costs incurred as of january   are summarized as follows total costs incurred as of accrual balance as of weeks ended january  accrual balance as of dollars in millions january  february  costs incurred cash payments january  employee severance costs contract termination subtotal accelerated depreciation total cost of sales was  million in  up from  million in the increase in cost of sales from to is primarily due to incremental sales due to the acquisition of stride rite and higher distribution center expenses

table of contents in  selling  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of from million in the period

impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit using both a market approach and an income approach 
if potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a change in events or circumstances  including a decision to hold an asset or group of assets for sale  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  due to weakening economic conditions combined with weaker than expected holiday sales  we revised our financial projections 
these circumstances indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill and  as such  we assessed the fair value of our goodwill to determine if its book value exceeded its fair value 
as a result of this update we determined that the book value of our goodwill did exceed its fair value and we recorded an impairment charge of million within the stride rite retail reporting segment 
interest income expense interest income and expense components were dollars in millions interest expense interest income interest expense income  net the increase in interest expense for compared to is primarily due to borrowings on our term loan facility used to fund the stride rite acquisition as well as borrowings on the revolving loan facility  offset by lower rates on the unhedged portion of the term loan facility 
the decline in interest income for is primarily a result of lower interest rates on our invested cash balance 
the increase in interest expense in compared to is due primarily to the increased borrowings of million used to fund the stride rite acquisition in august the decline in interest income is a result of the decrease in invested balances due to cash used to fund the stride rite and collective licensing acquisitions 
income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations was in versus in our effective tax rates have differed from the us statutory rate principally due to the impact of our operations conducted in jurisdictions with rates lower than the us statutory rate  the benefit of jurisdictional and employment tax credits  favorable adjustments to our income tax reserves due primarily to favorable settlements of examinations by taxing authorities and the on going implementation of tax efficient business initiatives 
our effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted in due to the impairment of goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for more information detailing the relative impact of these items on our tax rate on a comparative basis 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on february  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits is often highly judgmental 
determinations regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit can change as additional developments occur relative to the issue 
accordingly  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits 

table of contents we anticipate that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at january  will decrease by up to million within the next months due to potential settlements of on going examinations with tax authorities and the potential lapse of the statutes of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent that these tax benefits are recognized  the effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by up to million 
at january  deferred tax assets for state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards are million  less a valuation allowance of million 
the net operating losses related to recorded assets will expire as follows million in  million by  million in and  and million by federal foreign tax credit carryforwards are million  million of this credit will expire if not utilized by  and the remaining million of this credit will expire if not utilized by federal general business credit carryforwards are million which will expire if not utilized by state income tax credit carryforwards are million  less a valuation allowance of million 
the tax credit carryforwards related to the recorded assets expire as follows million by and million may be carried forward indefinitely 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for more information detailing the major components of our net deferred tax liability 
we recorded a valuation allowance against million of deferred tax assets arising in in addition  we reduced a valuation allowance by million during the year related to deferred tax assets of operations in a latin american country as a result of improved profitability in that country 
our consolidated balance sheet as of january  includes deferred tax assets  net of related valuation allowances  of million 
in assessing the future realization of these assets  we concluded it is more likely than not the assets will be realized 
this conclusion was based in large part upon management s belief that we will generate sufficient quantities of taxable income from operations in future years in the appropriate tax jurisdictions 
if our near term forecasts are not achieved  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
this could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in a particular period 
as of january   we have not provided tax on our cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries of approximately million  because it is our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely 
the calculation of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is complex and is not practicable 
if earnings were distributed  we would be subject to us taxes and withholding taxes payable to various foreign governments 
based on the facts and circumstances at that time  we would determine whether a credit for foreign taxes already paid would be available to reduce or offset the us tax liability 
we currently anticipate that earnings would not be repatriated unless it was tax efficient to do so 
impact of inflation in  we experienced inflationary pressures in china  where the majority of our products are made 
these pressures were exacerbated by a weak us dollar 
we are looking for ways to control costs by working with our factory partners on opportunities for production further inland and north in china  and other countries such as indonesia and india  as well as expanding our existing presence in vietnam 
we believe we will be able to manage cost by using a number of initiatives such as more direct sourcing and the consolidation of raw material suppliers and factories 
we expect to see a softening of inflationary pressure for minority interest  net of income taxes minority interest represents our joint venture partners share of net earnings or losses on applicable international operations 
the increase in minority interest expense from to and to is due to increased earnings from our joint ventures 
discontinued operations discontinued operations include parade  chile and peru stores as well as payless stores in north america and japan retail operations 
the loss from discontinued operations of million  net of income taxes and minority interest  during primarily relates to lease termination costs associated with the exit from parade 
there was no income or loss from discontinued operations in the loss from discontinued operations of million  net of income taxes and minority interest  during primarily relates to operating performance and disposal costs associated with our retail operations in japan

we plan to contribute million to our stride rite pension plan during the fiscal year 
our contributions beyond will depend upon market conditions  interest rates and other factors and may vary significantly in future years based upon the plan s funded status as of the measurement date 
we believe our internal cash flow will finance all of these future contributions 
cash flow used in investing activities in  our capital expenditures totaled million which included million for our payless domestic and payless international segments and million for our stride rite retail and stride rite wholesale segments 
for our payless domestic and payless international segments  capital expenditures for new and relocated stores were million  capital expenditures to remodel existing stores were million  capital expenditures for information technology hardware and systems development were million  capital expenditures for supply chain of million and capital expenditures for other necessary improvements including corporate expenditures were million 
we expect that cash paid for capital expenditures during will be approximately million

financial condition ratios a summary of key financial information for the periods indicated is as follows debt capitalization ratio debt to capitalization has been computed by dividing total debt by capitalization 
total debt is defined as long term debt including current maturities  notes payable and borrowings under the revolving line of credit  if applicable 
capitalization is defined as total debt and shareowners equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio  including the present value of future minimum rental payments under operating leases as debt and as capitalization  was   and  respectively  for the periods referred to above 
the increase of the debt capitalization ratio from to is primarily due to lower capitalization due to lower shareowners equity as a result of net losses in the increase in the debt capitalization ratio from to is due to the additional debt incurred to finance the stride rite acquisition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
inventories merchandise inventories in our stores are valued by the retail method and are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out fifo basis  or market 
prior to shipment to a specific store  inventories are valued at the lower of cost using the fifo basis  or market 
the retail method is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
under the retail method  cost is determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio across groupings of similar items  known as departments 
as a result  the retail method results in an averaging of inventory costs across similar items within a department 
the cost to retail ratio is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis 
current owned retail represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a regular basis reduced for any permanent or clearance markdowns 
as a result  the retail method normally results in an inventory valuation that is lower than a traditional fifo cost basis 

table of contents inherent in the retail method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including markdowns and shrinkage  which can significantly impact the owned retail and  therefore  the ending inventory valuation at cost 
specifically  the failure to take permanent or clearance markdowns on a timely basis can result in an overstatement of cost under the retail method 
we believe that our application of the retail method reasonably states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
wholesale inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the fifo method 
we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenues and operating margins may suffer if we are unable to effectively manage these risks 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable  which primarily relate to receivables from our wholesale customers  and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we also consider a review of accounts receivable aging  industry trends  customer financial strength  credit standing  and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred  while expenditures for store remodels  refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the product capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized 
projects in progress are stated at cost  which includes the cost of construction and other direct costs attributable to the project 
no provision for depreciation is made on projects in progress until such time as the relevant assets are completed and put into service 
property and equipment are reviewed on a store by store basis if an indicator of impairment exists to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable 
estimated future cash flows on a store by store basis are used to determine if impairment exists 
the underlying estimates of cash flows include estimates of future revenues  gross margin rates and store expenses and are based upon the stores past and expected future performance 
to the extent our estimates for revenue growth and gross margin rates are not realized  assessments of collectibility could result in impairment charges 
defined benefit plans the company has defined benefit pension plans 
one of the plans is frozen and no longer accrues future retirement benefits 
major assumptions used in the accounting for this employee benefit plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on our data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we use a cash flow matching approach for determining the appropriate discount rate for the defined benefit pension plan 
the approach is derived from us treasury rates  plus an option adjusted spread varying by maturity  to derive hypothetical aa corporate bond rates 
the calculation of pension expense is dependent on the determination of the assumptions used 
a basis point change in the discount rate will change expense by approximately million 
a basis point change in the expected long term return on assets will result in an approximate change of million in the expense 
insurance programs we retain our normal expected losses related primarily to workers compensation  physical loss to property and business interruption resulting from such loss and comprehensive general  product  and vehicle liability 
we purchase third party coverage for losses in excess of the normal expected levels 
provisions for losses expected under these programs are recorded 
table of contents based upon estimates of aggregate liability for claims incurred utilizing independent actuarial calculations 
these actuarial calculations utilize assumptions including historical claims experience  demographic factors and severity factors to estimate the frequency and severity of losses as well as the patterns surrounding the emergence  development and settlement of claims 
accounting for taxes we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  on february  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits is often highly judgmental 
determinations regarding the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit can change as additional developments occur relative to the issue 
accordingly  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate will be recovered from future taxable income 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to recognize the extent to which  more likely than not  the future tax benefits will not be realized 
if our near term forecasts are not achieved  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
this could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in a particular period 
environmental reserves we accrue for costs associated with environmental obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities sop 
accruals to address estimated costs for environmental obligations generally are recognized no later than the date when we learn what cleanup measures  if any  are likely to occur to address the environmental conditions at issue 
in accordance with sop  included in such obligations are the estimated direct costs to investigate and address the conditions on our property and the associated engineering  legal and consulting costs 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
in connection with the stride rite acquisition  we acquired property with a related environmental liability 
the liability as of january  was million  million of which was included as an accrued expense and million of which was included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the assessment of the liability and the associated costs were based upon available information after consultation with environmental engineers  consultants and attorneys assisting the company in addressing these environmental issues 
as of january   the costs to address these environmental conditions were million  including million of costs that have already been paid 
we estimate the range of total costs related to this environmental liability to be between million and million 
actual costs to address the environmental conditions may change based upon further investigations  the conclusions of regulatory authorities about information gathered in those investigations  the inherent uncertainties involved in estimating conditions in the environment  and the costs of addressing such conditions 
share based compensation we account for share based awards in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
as required by sfas no 
r  share based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the fair value of equity awards using a binomial model 
the binomial model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected life  stock price volatility and the forfeiture rate 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
accounting for goodwill we assess goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
this assessment is performed at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we have five 
table of contents reporting units for the purposes of assessing goodwill payless domestic  payless international  stride rite wholesale  stride rite retail  and collective licensing 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its book value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and the company must complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to the book value of the goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
fair value of the reporting units is determined using a combined income and market approach 
the income approach uses a reporting unit s projection of estimated cash flows that is discounted using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the market approach may involve use of the guideline transaction method  the guideline company method  or both 
the guideline transaction method makes use of available transaction price data of companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business as the respective reporting unit 
the guideline company method uses market multiples of publicly traded companies with operating characteristics similar to the respective reporting unit 
we consider value indications from both the income approach and market approach in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  giving them equal weighting in our analysis 
we also compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization at each reporting period 
management judgment is a significant factor in determining whether an indicator of impairment has occurred 
management relies on estimates in determining the fair value of each reporting unit  which include the following critical quantitative factors anticipated future cash flows and long term growth rates for each reporting unit 
the income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of expected changes in operating margins 
our projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in the our industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate could change 
a change in events or circumstances  a change in strategic direction  or a change in the competitive or economic environment could adversely affect the fair value of one or more reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  due to weakening economic conditions combined with weaker than expected holiday sales  we revised the financial projections of certain reporting units 
these circumstances indicated a potential impairment of our goodwill and  as such  we assessed the fair value of our goodwill to determine if the book value exceeded its fair value 
as a result of this update we determined that the book value of our goodwill exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment charge of million within the stride rite retail reporting segment 
if additional goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our goodwill totaled million as of january  a basis point increase in the discount rate or a basis point decrease in the long term growth rate used in determining the fair value of our reporting units  holding all other variables constant  could result in an incremental goodwill impairment of up to approximately million 
accounting for intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount 
favorable leases  certain tradenames and other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives using the straight line method 
customer relationships are amortized using a based on the time period over which the benefits of the asset are expected to occur 

table of contents each period we evaluate whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated useful life of each intangible asset 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
as of january   we had million of finite lived intangible assets and million of indefinite lived tradenames that are not amortized but are assessed for impairment on an annual basis and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of these assets may exceed their fair value 
the impairment test for indefinite lived tradenames compares each tradename s fair value to its book value 
if the book value of a tradename exceeds its fair value  the tradename is considered impaired and the company recognizes an impairment charge for the difference 
the fair values of our tradenames are determined using the relief from royalty method  which is a form of the income approach 
this method is based on the theory that the owner of the tradename is relieved of paying a royalty or license fee for the use of the tradename 
management judgment is a significant factor in determining whether an indicator of impairment for tradenames has occurred 
management relies on estimates in determining the fair value of each tradename  which include the following critical quantitative factors anticipated future revenues and long term growth rates for each tradename 
the relief from royalty approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future revenues  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
the company s projections of future revenues are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
reasonable market royalty rate for each tradename 
the relief from royalty approach to determining fair value requires selection of appropriate royalty rates for each tradename 
the rates selected depend upon  among other things  licensing agreements involving similar tradenames  historical and forecasted operating profit for each tradename and qualitative factors such as market awareness  history  longevity  and market size 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that these royalty rates could change 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the relief from royalty approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in the company s industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate could change 
in the fourth quarter of  due to changes in our financial projections as a result of the economic environment and a repositioning of our strategy for certain tradenames  we assessed certain of our tradename s book value and recorded an impairment charge  within cost of sales  of million related to our indefinite lived tradenames 
of this charge  million related to the stride rite tradename and million related to the keds tradename 
the estimate of fair value is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
if additional intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet become impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the company s intangible assets book value  net of amortization  was million as of january  the following table highlights the sensitivity of the stride rite and keds tradename impairment charge to changes in these assumptions  assuming all other assumptions remain constant 
approximate incremental dollars in millions impairment charge decrease of basis points in royalty rate decrease of basis points in average growth rate increase of basis points in the discount rate the estimated fair values for all of our other indefinite lived tradenames exceed their book value under the sensitivity changes described in the table above 
accounting for derivatives we participate in interest rate related derivative instruments to manage our exposure on our debt instruments 
we record all derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value under the provisions of sfas no

 fair value measurements sfas no 

the calculation of the fair value of the interest rate related derivative instruments is based on estimates of future interest rates and consideration of risk of nonperformance  which may change based on economic or other factors 
changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded either through net loss earnings or as other comprehensive loss  depending on the type of hedge designation 
gains and losses on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item 
as of january   a basis point increase in libor on the unhedged portion of the company s debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million annually or approximately million per quarter 
accounting for contingencies we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
except for income tax contingencies  we record accruals for contingencies to the extent that we conclude that their occurrence is probable and that the related liabilities are estimable and we record anticipated recoveries under existing insurance contracts when assured of recovery 
we consider many factors in making these assessments including the progress of the case  opinions or views of legal counsel  prior case law  the experience of the company or other companies in similar cases  and our intent on how to respond 
because litigation and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts do occur  these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
new accounting standards see note of the consolidated financial statements for new accounting standards  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest on our revolving loan facility  which is entirely comprised of a revolving line of credit  is based on the london inter bank offered rate libor plus a variable margin of to  or the base rate  as defined in the credit agreement 
there are no outstanding borrowings on the revolving loan facility at january   however  if we were to borrow against our revolving loan facility  borrowing costs may fluctuate depending upon the volatility of libor 
on august   we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement for million to hedge a portion of our variable rate term loan facility 
as of january   we have hedged million of our term loan facility 
the interest rate swap provides for a fixed interest rate of approximately  portions of which mature on a series of dates through may of the unhedged portion of the term loan facility is subject to interest rate risk depending on the volatility of libor 
as of january   a basis point increase in libor on the unhedged portion of the company s debt would impact pretax interest expense by approximately million annually or approximately million per quarter 
foreign currency risk we have operations in foreign countries  therefore  our cash flows in us dollars are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we adjust our retail prices  when possible  to reflect changes in exchange rates to mitigate this risk 
to further mitigate this risk  we may  from time to time  enter into forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies 
for the weeks ended january   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our operations or cash flows and we did not enter into any forward contracts to purchase or sell foreign currencies 
a significant percentage of our footwear is sourced from the people s republic of china the prc 
the national currency of the prc  the yuan  is currently not a freely convertible currency 
the value of the yuan depends to a large extent on the prc government s policies and upon the prc s domestic and international economic and political developments 
since  the official exchange rate for the conversion of the prc s currency was pegged to the us dollar at a virtually fixed rate of approximately yuan per us dollar 
however  during  the prc s government revalued the yuan and adopted a more flexible system based on a trade weighted basket of foreign currencies of the prc s main trading partners 
under the new managed float policy  the exchange rate of the yuan may shift each day up to in either direction from the previous day s close  and as a result  the valuation of the yuan may increase incrementally over time should the prc central bank allow it to do so  which could significantly increase the cost of the products we source from the prc 
as of january   the last day of trading in our fiscal year  the exchange rate was yuan per us dollar compared to yuan per us dollar at the end of our fiscal year and yuan per us dollar at the end of our fiscal year
