significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions of businesses and technologies  cash dividends and common stock repurchases 
cash balances and cash provided from operations continue to be the company s primary source of funds 
although the global financial markets and worldwide economies continue to experience extreme disruption and volatility  the company believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financing flexibility

due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows  the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

table of contents and business combinations 
in connection with some of these activities  the company agrees to make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved  such as the achievement of research and development targets  receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets 
such payments  when made  are allocated to specific intangible asset categories  assigned to excess of cost over net assets acquired or charged to research and development  depending on the nature of the arrangement 
purchase obligations the company s business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers 
these inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the company s projected requirements over the related terms and are in the normal course of business 
other long term liabilities the company s estimate of required funding obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and deferred compensation 
management s use of non gaap measures net sales on a constant currency basis is a non gaap financial measure 
the company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods 
because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales  the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company s investors 
constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior year s local currency sales by the current period s exchange rate 
constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows 
the limitation of these non gaap measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis 
non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable gaap disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for gaap results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described below are areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition generally  sales to end user customers and european distributors are recognized at the point of delivery  and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment 
in certain circumstances  end user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customer s location 
in the case of consignment inventories  revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment fas r 
under this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company utilizes a binomial model 
inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at grant date with a term equal to the expected term of the stock option 
ii 
table of contents the company s expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the company s stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options 
the company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility 
this approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations 
with respect to the weighted average option life assumption  the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including  for example  product liability matters  environmental matters  employment disputes  disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes  the outcomes of which are not within the company s complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
the company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and or costs related to claims  settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  the company accrues the minimum amount of the range 
the company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers when those recoveries are probable and collectible 
there is no guarantee  however  that amounts will be adequate to cover damages and or costs  that insurers will be able to pay claims or that coverage will otherwise be available 
legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside the united states 
the company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities 
these positions relate to  among others  transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions and other matters 
effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
the recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on the company s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
the company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions 
the reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired or the position is effectively settled 
the company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial position or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a future period 
allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns the company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the company s accounts receivable  amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market 
in estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers 
in estimating the allowance for customer rebates  management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customer s rebate claim  customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate 
the company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts 
in estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns  management considers product obsolescence  quantity on hand  future demand for the product and ii 
table of contents other market related conditions 
the company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value 
the company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists 
it is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change 
depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors  the impact to the company s financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change 
acquisitions the company accounts for acquired businesses using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets is recorded as goodwill 
purchased r d is expensed at the date of acquisition if technological feasibility has not been established and no alternative future use exists 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased r d and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for purchased r d  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
when the company acquires net assets that do not constitute a business under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  no goodwill is recognized 
the judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
intangible assets other than goodwill and other long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
pension plans the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
a change of plus minus basis points in the discount rate assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million favorable unfavorable impact on the company s net pension cost 
a change of plus minus basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption  with other assumptions held constant  would have an estimated million favorable unfavorable impact on the company s net pension cost 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments 
the company s foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the company s international operations 
the company s objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets  liabilities  net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations 
the instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
the company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow 
the principal currencies the company hedges are the euro  the british pound  the mexican peso and the japanese yen 
any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
bard s risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at december  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million  and if the us dollar uniformly weakened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by million 
any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
in december  the company issued million of notes due note holders had a one time option to redeem the notes at par value on december  in the fourth quarter of  approximately million of the notes were redeemed 
the market value of the notes approximated million at december  assuming a basis point increase or decrease in us interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity  the market value of the notes would have approximated million or million  respectively  on december  ii
