item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and to item a 
risk factors herein 

table of contents data storage media industry the global data storage market  including hardware and services  is estimated to be in excess of billion  of which the removable data storage media market is approximately billion including magnetic and optical media  flash and solid state drives  removable and external hard disk drives 
our removable data storage media products are designed to help users capture  create  protect  preserve and retrieve valuable digital assets 
our primary products include recordable and rewritable optical discs  magnetic tape cartridges  usb flash drives  and external and removable hard drives used by business and individual customers 
demand for data storage capacity is expected to grow for the next several years  driven by the rapid growth of information in digital form  the growth of complex databases as a result of new hardware and software applications  increased ability to access data remotely and across multiple locations  increased regulatory requirements for record retention and the pervasive use of the internet 
this increased quantity of data has put data security and archiving at the forefront of critical business processes 
further  the continued growth in the variety and functionality of consumer electronic devices has increased demand for a range of convenient  low cost removable data storage media to capture  store  edit and manage data  photographs  video  images and music 
within the data storage media industry  the magnetic tape market remains important to imation with growing demand for storage capacity across a substantial installed base of commercial information technology users  a relatively small number of competitors and high barriers to entry 
imation enjoys a leading market share  significant intellectual property portfolio  solid industry reputation and relationships among key original equipment manufacturers oems 
many of our legacy tape formats  which are proprietary or semi proprietary  have the highest gross profit margins among all our products 
while the need for removable data storage capacity is expected to grow slightly  the removable media market size is expected to decline in terms of revenue 
the magnetic tape industry has consistently addressed the growth in demand for storage capacity with new non proprietary storage formats with higher capacity cartridges resulting in lower cost per gigabyte and a decline in actual number of units of media shipped 
in addition  these non proprietary open formats experience greater price competition than proprietary formats 
non proprietary open format tape typically is more competitive with lower gross margins and continues to gain share against legacy formats 
these factors inhibit the overall revenue growth of the industry 
in the current economic environment  we have seen this trend accelerate  especially among some of our enterprise class customers  most notably financial institutions which represent approximately percent of our magnetic tape revenues 
in addition  lower cost disk and optimization strategies such as virtual tape and de duplication remain a factor in certain sectors of the market 
as a result  we expect our tape revenue and margins to continue to be under pressure as these factors result in a decline in the size of the total tape media market over time and a shift in the mix of total tape revenue toward lower margin open formats 
our recordable optical media product sales are primarily composed of cds and dvds sold throughout the world under various brands we own or control imation  memorex and tdk life on record as well as under a distribution agreement for the hp brand 
we also have a majority interest in global data media gdm a sales and marketing joint venture for optical media 
while our different brands have varying strengths in different regions of the world  in aggregate we have the leading overall market share for recordable optical media globally 
while the overall market for cds and dvds is declining as hard disk and flash media replace optical media in some applications such as music and video recording  we have increased both our optical revenue and market share through our acquisitions 
in addition  we sell blu ray recordable media as a new and emerging higher capacity format targeted at the recording of high definition video content 
our optical media products are sold through a variety of retail and commercial distribution channels and sourced from manufacturers primarily in taiwan and india 
our flash media sales are primarily composed of usb flash drives sold through a variety of retail and commercial distribution channels around the world under the imation  memorex and tdk life on record brands and are sourced from manufacturers in asia 
the removable flash media market is competitive with highly variable price swings driven by nand chip manufacturing volumes and capacity as well as market demand in the much larger embedded flash market 
focused and efficient sourcing and distribution  as well as diligent management of inventories  channel placement and promotional activity  are critical elements for success in this market 
these are areas of focus as we implement our strategy focused on our transformation to a brand and product management company as further described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein  in addition to usb flash drives  we sell a limited amount of flash cards and solid state drives ssd 

table of contents audio and video consumer electronics industry we also participate in the audio and video marketplace of the much larger consumer electronics market 
the consumer electronics market is broadly defined as traditional analog based audio and video devices as well as digital based audio and video hardware and accessories for recording and replaying audio and video content 
the accessories market includes cases  cleaning and labeling products  cables and connectors sold through retail outlets and distribution channels 
both consumer electronic products and accessories are sourced from manufacturers throughout asia 
consumer electronic products are sold based on a variety of factors  including brand and reputation  product features and designs  distribution coverage  innovation and price 
the global consumer electronics market is a very large and highly diverse market in terms of competitors  channels and products 
our current product offerings focus on a subset of this market which we estimate to be approximately billion audio and video products and accessories 
products we sell include cd and dvd players  lcd displays flat panel televisions and digital picture frames  ipod accessories  mp players  karaoke machines  and alarm clocks and clock radios sold primarily under the memorex brand name and certain character based properties under license 
we compete primarily in mass merchant channels for second tier brand preference in the united states and are expanding into canada  mexico and europe with the memorex brand  targeting female consumers  and the xtrememac brand  targeting the apple enthusiast 
business segments we operate in two broad market categories removable data storage media products and accessories and audio and video consumer electronic products and accessories electronic products 
data storage media products and accessories the data storage media market is organized  managed and reported  internally and externally  as three segments differentiated by the regional markets we serve americas  europe and asia pacific 
each of these segments has the responsibility for selling virtually all of our product lines except for consumer electronic products which are sold primarily through our electronic products segment 
the americas segment  our largest segment by revenue  includes north america  south america and the caribbean 
the united states represents the largest current market for our products 
it has a great variety and sophistication of distribution channels from value added resellers  oems  retail outlets  mass merchants and on line resellers 
the countries of south america and the caribbean represent potential growth markets with increasing penetration of information technology in the commercial and consumer markets 
europe is our second largest segment by revenue and also incorporates our business results in most of the middle east  africa and most of the results of gdm 
western europe exhibits traits similar to north america in terms of overall breadth of products  high penetration of end user markets and breadth and sophistication of distribution channels 
emerging markets in eastern europe and the middle east represent potential growth markets for our products as it end user and consumer markets grow 
asia pacific apac is our smallest segment in terms of revenue and largest segment in terms of geographic area covered and populations served 
it also has the widest diversity of languages  cultures and currencies of any of our segments 
japan is the single largest market in apac and is similar to north america and western europe in terms of overall penetration of it into the market  though distribution channels are less developed than those in other regions 

table of contents audio and video consumer electronic products and accessories we entered into the consumer electronics market with the memcorp acquisition during the third quarter of and created our electronic products ep segment 
the ep segment sells consumer electronics and is currently focused primarily in north america and primarily under the memorex brand name 
this segment experiences some degree of seasonality with its focus on consumer channels resulting in the second half of the year being relatively stronger than the first 
the chart below breaks out our revenue by segment pie chart see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business segments and geographic information 
description of business products and application areas the table below describes our revenue by product category 
optical products consist of recordable cds  dvds and blu ray 
magnetic products consist of data storage tape media  floppy diskettes and audio and video tape products 
flash products consist of usb flash drives  flash cards and ssd and are sold primarily under the memorex brand 
electronic products consist of consumer electronic products sold by the memcorp business 
accessories and other include cd and dvd labeling products  storage cases and cleaning products as well as products and services not otherwise classified 
years ended december  of of of dollars in millions revenue total revenue total revenue total optical magnetic flash electronic products  accessories and other total data storage products  whether for business or consumer applications  are addressed by our broad range of media across magnetic  optical  solid state usb flash drives and hard disk platforms 
storage capacities on more established products range from megabyte cd r recordable and cd rw rewritable optical discs to gigabyte gb double sided dvd optical discs 
products include usb flash drives with capacities ranging from gb up to gb 
the capacities for usb flash drive and hard disk continue to increase as new products are introduced 
our blu ray recordable media currently offers gb to gb of capacity 
capacity for removable hard disk drive cartridges ranges from gb to terabyte tb 

table of contents our tape products are used for back up  business and operational continuity planning  disaster recovery  near line data storage and retrieval  cost effective mass storage and archival storage and are used across major application areas  including enterprise data centers  the network server environment and small medium businesses 
native capacity of our tape products ranges from less than gb up to tb per piece of media 
our consumer electronics portfolio includes cd and dvd players  lcd displays flat panel televisions and digital picture frames  ipod accessories  mp players  karaoke machines  and alarm clocks and clock radios sold primarily under the memorex brand name and certain character based properties under license 
the portfolio continues to evolve with consumer demand and with development of our brands 
customers  marketing and distribution as described above  our removable data storage media products are used by business customers and by individual consumers and our electronic products are sold primarily to individual consumers 
no one customer constituted percent or more of our revenue in  or our products are sold through a combination of distributors  wholesalers  value added resellers  oems and retail outlets 
worldwide  approximately percent of our revenue came from distributors  percent came from the retail channel and percent came from oems 
we maintain a company sales force of approximately representatives to generate sales of our products around the world 
we have sales offices worldwide  with in the united states and internationally 
we work with oems that develop or market tape drives  tape libraries  tape automation systems and servers with storage subsystems for differing customer applications 
oems include sun storagetek  ibm  hp and tandberg 
we are the sole source of supply for certain tape cartridges for use with sun storagetek  ibm and tandberg drives used in the high end data center 
the development of future tape formats with key oems is an important element in our ability to successfully compete in the tape market and the loss of such a relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  we began to enhance and build our brand management capabilities as we expanded our brand portfolio 
we are building a brand and marketing management organization  comprised of individuals from both within and outside of imation as well as acquired businesses  combining industry experience and consumer marketing expertise 
competition the global market for our products is highly competitive and characterized by continuing changes in technology  frequent new product introductions and performance improvements  diverse distribution channels  aggressive marketing and pricing practices and ongoing variable price erosion 
competition is based on a multitude of factors  including brand strength  distribution presence and capability  channel knowledge and expertise  geographic availability  breadth of product line  product cost  media capacity  access speed and performance  durability  reliability  scalability and compatibility 
our primary competitors in magnetic tape include fujifilm corporation  sony corporation and hitachi maxell ltd 
our primary competitors in optical include sony corporation  hitachi maxell ltd  verbatim corporation and sandisk corporation 
our primary competitors in flash include sandisk corporation  lexar media  inc  pny electronics  inc  and kingston technology  inc 
our primary competitors in external and removable hard drives include wd  seagate technology  lacie  iomega corporation and tandberg 
while these companies compete in the removable data storage media market  most of them generally do not report financial results for these business lines on a stand alone basis 
therefore  it is difficult for us to estimate our relative market share 
however  we use a variety of industry sources to estimate market size and share and we estimate that in  the latest period for which data is available  we held a leading market share in magnetic and optical products with more than one third of those markets 
we estimated that we held a much smaller market share in flash and removable and external hard disk products 

table of contents our competitors in the consumer electronics market are numerous manufacturers and brands  including the ihome  philips  rca  vizio and griffin brands  some of which are much larger companies than imation 
our total of the united states consumer electronics market share is currently less than one percent 
manufacturing we conduct coating operations for the manufacture of magnetic data storage tape products at our facility in weatherford  oklahoma  which is certified to iso quality standards and has a state of the art magnetic tape coating capability that began operation in in  we announced our intention to exit our wahpeton  north dakota facility and in we announced our intention to exit our camarillo  california facility 
by the end of we ceased manufacturing operations at both the wahpeton  north dakota facility and the camarillo  california facility 
as part of those steps we consolidated all coating activity in weatherford  oklahoma and either ended or outsourced other manufacturing activities occurring in those locations by the end of those outsourced include conversion of coated tape into finished cartridges and manufacture of plastic components 
to manufacture magnetic tape media  a thin film material is precisely and uniformly coated with a magnetic dispersion solution 
the coating of high quality magnetic tape media requires exacting manufacturing process steps with precise physical  electrical and chemical tolerances as well as significant technical expertise in several areas including coating processes  servo writing and magnetic and material science 
to meet the market requirements for future advanced tape media products with higher data transfer rates  greater data density  and faster tape speeds  we must be capable of coating thinner substrates with smaller particle sizes and increased uniformity  surface smoothness and bit and track density 
we do not manufacture optical media  removable or external hard disk  usb flash drive products or consumer electronic products or storage accessories 
they are currently sourced from manufacturing plants outside the united states 
raw materials and other purchased products the principal raw materials we use for the manufacture of removable data storage media products include plastic resins  polyester films  magnetic pigments  specialty chemicals and solvents 
we make significant purchases of these and other materials and components for use in our manufacturing operations from domestic and foreign sources 
there are two sources of supply for the base film  one of which supplies the newer  more advanced base film  and there are two sources for the metal particulate pigments on which the industry relies for use in the manufacture of higher capacity magnetic data storage cartridges 
if supply was disrupted or prices significantly increased for any of these key materials  our business and the business of our competitors could be negatively impacted 
we also rely on certain partners as sole suppliers for components and raw materials used in our manufacturing processes 
the loss of these certain suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the business 
except as noted above  we are not overly dependent on any single supplier of raw materials 
on july   we acquired substantially all of the assets relating to the marketing  distribution  sales  customer service and support of removable recording media products  accessory products and ancillary products being sold under the tdk life on record brand name tdk recording media  from tdk corporation  a japanese corporation tdk  including the assets or capital stock of tdk s operating subsidiaries engaged in the tdk recording media business 
in conjunction with our acquisition of the tdk recording media business we also entered into a supply agreement  dated july   with tdk supply agreement  to purchase a limited number of lto tape media and blu ray removable recording media products and accessory products for resale under the tdk life on record brand name 
tdk agreed to supply such products on competitive terms  and tdk agreed not to sell any such products to third parties for resale under the tdk life on record brand name during the term of the trademark license agreements 
the trademark license agreements will continue unless terminated by tdk no earlier than the supply agreement will continue for the greater of five years or for so long as tdk manufactures any of the products 

table of contents we also make significant purchases of finished and semi finished products  including optical media and usb flash drives  certain finished tape and tape cartridges and electronic products  primarily from asian suppliers 
for our optical media  we procure our supply primarily from three companies 
if supply were disrupted from any of these companies  our business could be negatively impacted 
the loss of these certain suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the business 
we view the sourcing and distribution of finished goods as a critical success factor for those products we do not manufacture 
therefore  we seek to establish and maintain strategic sourcing relationships with several key suppliers 
research and development development and timely introduction of new removable data storage media products are important to our future success 
we maintain an advanced research facility and invest resources in researching and developing potential new products and improving existing products 
we invest in research  development and capital equipment in order to remain competitive and successfully develop  manufacture and source media that meets market requirements 
we also invest  through third party industrial designers  in design and feature enhancements for our removable and external hard drive and consumer electronic products 
we are also engaged in certain research programs that do not yet have specific commercialized products in the market  related to future generations of magnetic tape  both on our own and in collaboration with other organizations 
our research and development r d expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in  we announced a strategy focused on our transformation to a brand and product management company 
this transformation included a cost reduction program in our manufacturing and research and development organization 
the decrease in our r d expense was due to an alignment of our resources with our strategic direction 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and copyright laws  trade secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements to protect the intellectual property rights related to our products 
we register our patents and trademarks in the united states and in a number of other countries where we do business 
united states patents are currently granted for a term of twenty years from the date a patent application is filed 
united states trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade 
pursuant to trademark license agreements between tdk and imation and its affiliates  tdk granted imation and its affiliates a long term exclusive license to use the tdk life on record brand for current and future recordable magnetic  optical  flash media and accessory products globally 
that right is revocable by tdk in the year  with a one year wind down 
during  we were awarded united states patents and at the end of the year held over patents in the united states 
sourcing  supply chain and distribution as our revenue mix shifts increasingly to sales from products we do not manufacture  our sourcing  supply chain and distribution capabilities worldwide are increasingly important 
as a result  in we centralized our corporate operations organization to coordinate sourcing for purchased finished goods products across all our businesses 
we also have consolidated distribution centers in the united states  europe and parts of asia 
employees at december   we employed approximately  people worldwide  with approximately employed in the united states and approximately employed internationally 
environmental matters our operations are subject to a wide range of federal  state and local environmental laws 
environmental remediation costs are accrued when a probable liability has been determined and the amount of such liability has been reasonably estimated 
these accruals are reviewed periodically as remediation and investigatory activities proceed and are adjusted accordingly 
compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our financial results 
as of december   we had environmental related accruals totaling million and we had minor remedial activities underway at one of our facilities 
we believe that our accruals are adequate  though there can be no assurance that the amount of expense relating to remedial actions and compliance with applicable environmental laws will not exceed the amounts reflected in our accruals 

table of contents international operations approximately percent of our total revenue came from sales outside the united states  primarily through subsidiaries  sales offices  distributors and relationships with oems throughout europe  asia  latin america and canada 
the removable data storage market is at different levels of development and penetration in different geographic regions 
as a result  growth rates will typically vary in different application areas and product categories in different parts of the world 
our ep segment does not have material operations internationally 
we do not manufacture outside the united states 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information by geographic region 
as discussed under risk factors in item a of this form k  our international operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties that are not present in our domestic operations

risk factors 
our business faces many risks 
any of the risks discussed below  or elsewhere in this form k or our other sec filings  could have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our global business is subject to a number of risks related to the global credit crisis and economic downturn 
as widely reported  markets globally have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months  including  among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
worldwide economic conditions have deteriorated  with many countries  including the united states  formally announcing that their economies are in a recession 
this downturn is evidenced by declining revenues and profitability across many industries  increased unemployment  reduced capital spending  increasing rates of consumer default and corporate bankruptcies  and decreased consumer confidence and spending 
governments have taken unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions 
there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in global financial markets in major economies 
we cannot predict the duration or severity of this economic downturn or the extent of which the global economic conditions could negatively effect our business  operating results and financial condition 
these economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways 
unfavorable economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to improve our performance 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders or non payment of amounts owed to imation 
the decline in economic conditions may also diminish consumer demand for our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the significant and rapid downturn in the global economy has negatively affected demand for both our commercial and consumer product lines  and is impacting suppliers  distributors and channel partners 
for example  as a result of the financial market turmoil  data center customers in several large financial institutions scaled back  deferred or stopped purchase activity altogether 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries 

table of contents significant litigation matters could result in large costs and distraction to our business 
we are subject to various pending or threatened legal actions  including the philips and sandisk disputes and in the ordinary course of our business 
litigation is always subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable 
we cannot ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of any monetary liability or financial impact that may be incurred by us in litigation 
see item legal proceedings herein for a description of our disputes with philips and sandisk 
continued disruption in united states and international credit markets may adversely affect our ability to draw on our credits lines or obtain financing from alternative sources on reasonable terms or at all  and may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
recent disruptions in national and international credit markets have lead to a scarcity of credit  tighter lending standards and higher interest rates on business loans 
continued disruption may materially limit our credit availability 
we could incur significant expenses or shortfalls in anticipated cash generated as a result of unanticipated events in our business or competitive  regulatory  or other changes in the markets in which we compete 
as a result  we may  in the future  need to obtain financing 
the availability of such financing is limited by the tightening of the global credit markets 
if our lenders are adversely affected by economic conditions in domestic or international capital markets  they may become unwilling or unable to fund borrowings under their credit facilities with us 
in such a case  we might not be able to locate replacement lenders or other sources of financing  on reasonable terms  or at all  which could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development and other corporate needs 
failure of lenders to provide sufficient financing may constrain our ability to operate or grow the business and to make complementary strategic business and or brand acquisitions 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to extend our current credit facilities or to enter into a new credit facility could be impaired if current market conditions continue or worsen 
lenders may seek more restrictive lending provisions and higher interest rates that may reduce our borrowing capacity and increase our costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
if other financing is not available on acceptable terms or at all  we may not be able to respond adequately to these changes or maintain our business  which could adversely affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock 
our financial success depends in part on our ability to profitably grow our business in the consumer electronics market 
one element of our strategy is the sourcing of a portfolio of consumer video  audio and electronic products 
this is a strategic segment where we have had limited sales and marketing experience 
our financial success is dependent on successfully increasing our brand portfolio and product offerings to profitably grow market share in the united states and worldwide 
if we are not successful in profitably expanding our product portfolio  creating brand awareness and developing new customers our financial results could be impacted 
additionally  in an economic recession or under other adverse economic conditions described above  customers and vendors could make fewer purchases of our products  and may be more likely to fail to meet contractual terms or their payment obligations and product areas such as consumer electronics may be significantly affected 
our international operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in political  economic and other conditions and foreign currency fluctuations 
we conduct our business on a global basis  with percent of our revenue derived from operations outside of the united states 
our international operations may be subject to various risks which are not present in domestic operations  including political and economic instability  terrorist activity  the possibility of expropriation  trade tariffs or embargoes  unfavorable tax laws  restrictions on royalties  dividend and currency remittances  changes in foreign laws and regulations  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
in addition  our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets 
changes in local and regional economic conditions  including fluctuations in exchange rates  may affect product demand in our non us operations and export markets 
foreign currency fluctuations can also affect reported profits of our non us operations where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies 
in addition  currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 

table of contents accordingly  fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non us operating units are translated into us dollars 
given that the majority of our revenues are non us based  a strengthening of the us dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 
while these factors or the impact of these factors are difficult to predict  any one or more of them could adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
if we do not successfully implement our global restructuring plans and realize the benefits expected from the restructuring  our financial results will be affected 
we have announced multiple restructuring plans focused on transforming imation into a brand and product management company 
this transformation has included cost reduction restructuring programs in our manufacturing and r d organizations along with programs intended to redesign and simplify our corporate structure globally 
these programs are focused on aligning our resources with our strategic direction 
we may not be able to realize the expected benefits and cost savings if we do not successfully consolidate or outsource our magnetic tape cartridge converting operations 
if these factors limit our ability to restructure our operations successfully  or on a timely basis  our expectations of future results of operations  including certain cost savings expected to result from the restructuring may not be met 
if such difficulties are encountered or such cost savings are not realized  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not successfully manage our multiple brands on a global basis  it could have a material impact on our financial results 
one element of our company s profitable growth strategy is to acquire and successfully manage a balanced portfolio of strong commercial and consumer brands focused on data storage media and consumer electronic products 
our financial success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage the brands to maintain our strong recognition and presence in existing markets worldwide  grow brand recognition and presence in other areas of the world  grow our recognition and presence in areas of the world in which we do not currently operate and to grow our retail channel penetration 
our success is dependent on a number of factors including our ability to develop effective sales and marketing programs that enhance the strength of our brands and ability to increase retail channel penetration with leading edge product innovation and increased product offerings 
if one of our brands suffers a substantial impediment to its reputation due to real or perceived quality issue  our market share declines significantly or our sales and marketing programs are not effective  our results could be negatively impacted 
we must make strategic decisions from time to time as to the products and technologies in which we invest and if we choose the wrong product or technology  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
our operating results are dependent upon our ability to successfully develop  manufacture  source and market innovative new products and services 
new product and technology innovations may require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability and a return on the investment may never be realized 
because of the rapid technology changes in our industry  we may not be able to compete if we cannot quickly develop  source and introduce differentiating and innovative products 
we operate in a highly competitive environment against competitors who are both larger and smaller than us in terms of resources and market share 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions 
in these highly competitive and changing markets  our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to continue to develop and introduce differentiated and innovative products and services cost effectively and on a timely basis 
the success of our offerings is dependent on several factors including our differentiation from competitive offerings  timing of new product introductions  effectiveness of marketing programs and maintaining low manufacturing  sourcing and supply chain costs 
no assurance can be given with regard to our ability to anticipate and react to changes in market requirements  react to the actions of competitors or react to the pace and direction of technology changes 
we may be dependent on third parties for new product introductions or technologies in order to introduce our own new products 
we are dependent in some cases upon various third parties  such as certain drive manufacturers  for the introduction and acceptance of new products  the timing of which is out of our control 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will maintain existing or create new oem relationships 
there can be also no assurance that we will continue to have access to significant proprietary technologies through internal development and licensing arrangements with third parties  or that we will continue to have access to new competitive technologies that may be required to introduce new products

table of contents operating losses in tax jurisdictions with deferred tax assets could hinder our ability to continue to carry the deferred tax assets  which would result in a valuation allowance negatively impacting our consolidated results and net worth 
in a tax jurisdiction with a net deferred tax asset  the considerations for determining whether the asset can continue to be carried on the financial statements  include  amongst others  whether there has been cumulative profit defined as pre tax income adjusted by permanent differences over the preceding three year period 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that while we have reported a consolidated cumulative loss over the three year period ended december   this loss includes certain goodwill impairments which can be excluded from the calculation of cumulative profit 
excluding these goodwill impairments  we have a consolidated cumulative profit over the most recent three year period in all tax jurisdictions where a net deferred tax asset is recorded 
while we have a history of profits  our profitability has declined over the last three years and we recorded a loss in the current year in the united states where the majority of our deferred tax assets are recorded 
therefore achievement of profitability in the united states in will be a significant factor in determining our continuing ability to carry these deferred tax assets 
significant negative events could impact the ability to carry the deferred tax assets in future periods impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth 
goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired 
goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units 
we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to the fair value of the unit 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we revalue all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including goodwill  to determine if goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount  impairment has occurred 
our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model and then compared to the market capitalization of the company 
growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long range planning process 
we also make estimates of discount rates  perpetuity growth assumptions  market comparables and other factors 
we evaluate assets on our balance sheet  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
our estimate of the fair value of the assets may be based on fair value appraisals or discounted cash flow models using various inputs 
as of december   we had million of definite lived intangible assets subject to amortization and million of goodwill 
while we believe that the current carrying value of these assets is not impaired  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses 
our stock price may be subject to significant volatility due to our results or market trends 
if revenue  earnings or cash flows in any quarter fail to meet the investment community s expectations  there could be an immediate negative impact on our stock price 
our stock price may also be affected by broader market trends and world events unrelated to our performance 
our financial success depends upon our ability to manufacture  source and deliver products to our customers at acceptable quality  volume and cost levels 
our success depends on our ability to source  manufacture and deliver products to our customers at acceptable quality  volume and cost levels 
the manufacture of our magnetic tape products involves complex and precise processes requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments 
if we do not manage these processes effectively  changes could significantly hurt our ability to meet our customers product volume and quality needs at acceptable costs 
even within a clean room environment  minor equipment malfunctions in any one of the many manufacturing process steps could halt production and lead to additional costs 
further  existing manufacturing techniques may not achieve our volume and cost targets 
in these cases  there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve these targets 
for sourced products  we must be able to obtain quality products at a price that will allow us to sell the products at an acceptable gross margin 
to the extent we cannot control costs or price erosion is greater than expected  our financial results may be negatively impacted 

table of contents if we do not achieve the expected benefits from strategic relationships  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
in  we entered into a series of agreements with mbi that established mbi as a significant  non exclusive source for our optical media products and created gdm as a joint venture sales and distribution company for optical media products 
we hold a percent interest in gdm and mbi holds a percent interest 
as the controlling shareholder of this subsidiary  we consolidate the results of gdm in our financial statements 
we have also entered into other strategic relationships and distribution agreements over the past several years with ibm  hp  sun storagetek  tandberg and others  where we are the exclusive distributor on a global or regional basis 
if we do not perform at levels expected with these relationships  our volumes and growth prospects may not be realized which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
significant changes in discount rates  rates of return on pension assets  mortality tables and other factors could affect our future earnings  equity and pension funding requirements 
pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual investment results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions 
our funding requirements are also based on these assumptions in addition to the performance of the assets in the plans 
the most critical assumptions are the discount rate  the long term expected return on assets and mortality 
other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age 
some of these assumptions  such as the discount rate  are largely outside of our control 
changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings  equity and funding requirements 
in  the declines in the united states equity markets resulted in a significant decrease in our plan assets 
we use a variety of raw materials  supplier provided parts  components  sub systems and third party contract manufacturing services in our businesses  and significant shortages  supplier capacity constraints  supplier production disruptions or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 
our reliance on suppliers  third party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials  parts and components used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials 
in some instances  we depend upon a single source of supply  manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers 
a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers  supplier capacity constraints  supplier and third party contract manufacturer production disruptions  price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs 
we believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices 
no assurances can be given that acceptable cost levels will continue in the future 
in addition  some critical raw materials and key components have a limited number of suppliers 
if we cannot obtain those raw materials or critical components from the suppliers  we will not be able to produce certain of our products 
in the global consumer electronics market  flat panel displays are in high demand and if our vendors fail to supply us with products we may not meet the demands of our customers and revenue could decline 
a material change in customer relationships or in customer demand for products could have a significant impact on our business 
we are transforming the company into a brand and product management organization and increasing our reliance on retail customers 
our success is dependent on our ability to successfully offer trade terms that are acceptable to our customers and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets 
our business could suffer if we cannot reach agreements with key customers based on our trade terms and principles 
in addition  our business would be negatively impacted if key customers were to significantly reduce the range or inventory level of our products 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights  including the imation  tdk life on record  memorex and xtrememac brands  and to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims of others  including the philips patent cross license claim 
claims may arise from time to time alleging that we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
if we are not successful in defending ourselves against those claims  we could incur substantial costs in implementing remediation actions  such as redesigning our products or processes  paying for license rights or paying to settle disputes 
the related costs or the disruption to our operations could have a material adverse effect on us

in the normal course of business  we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
there have historically been no material losses related to such indemnifications 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we are the subject of various pending or threatened legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
all such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
consequently  as of december   we are unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of any monetary liability or financial impact that we may incur with respect to these matters 
while these matters could materially affect operating results depending upon the final resolution in future periods  it is our opinion that after final disposition  except for possibly the philips dispute described below  any monetary liability beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  would not be material to our financial position 
philips imation filed a declaratory judgment action on october   in federal district court in st 
paul  minnesota requesting that the court resolve an ongoing dispute with philips electronics nv  nv philips corporation and north american philips corporation collectively  philips 
philips has asserted that the patent cross license between m company and philips was not validly assigned to imation in connection with the spin off of imation from m company in  imation s percent owned subsidiary  global data media gdm  is not a subsidiary as defined in the cross license  the coverage of the cross license does not apply to imation s acquisition of memorex  the cross license does not apply to dvd discs  certain philips patents that are not covered by the cross license are infringed by imation  and as a result  imation owes philips royalties for the prior and future sales of cd and dvd discs 
we believe that these allegations are without merit and filed a declaratory judgment action to have a court reaffirm imation s rights under the cross license 
on february   the parties signed a standstill agreement and the litigation was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice 
imation and philips held settlement negotiations but were unable to come to an agreement 
imation re filed its declaratory judgment action on august  philips filed its answer and counterclaims against imation and mbi  imation s partner in gdm 
philips alleged that the cross license does not apply to companies that imation purchased or created after march   gdm is not a legitimate subsidiary of imation  imation s formation of gdm is a breach of the cross license resulting in termination of the cross license at that time  imation including memorex and gdm infringes various patents that would otherwise be licensed under the cross license  and imation including memorex and gdm infringes one or more patents that are not covered by the cross license 
philips originally claimed damages of million plus interest and costs  as well as a claim requesting a trebling of that amount 
imation was aware of these claims prior to filing its declaratory judgment action 

table of contents on october   imation filed its answers to philips counterclaims and a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the patent cross license was validly assigned by m company to imation 
philips did not contest imation s motion and on november   the parties filed a stipulation affirming that the cross license was validly assigned to imation 
on april   philips amended its counterclaims to add claims that dvd discs sold by imation infringe its patents  and withdraw its specific claim of million in damages in favor of the more general damages in an amount to be proved at trial 
on may   philips filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings that the cross license does not apply to subsidiaries acquired or formed by imation after march  under this interpretation  the license would not apply to gdm or memorex products  inc imation disagrees with this interpretation 
the parties held court ordered settlement discussions from june through september  however  no agreement was reached 
on october   imation filed a motion for leave to amend its complaint 
on november   the magistrate judge denied imation s motion 
imation filed its objection to the magistrate judge s order and on february   the court affirmed the magistrate judge s decision 
on november   the court issued a decision granting philips motion for judgment on the pleadings relating to subsidiaries formed after march  following this ruling  imation and mbi filed a motion for the court to certify the ruling on this issue as final under frcp b allowing for an interlocutory appeal to the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the court granted this motion on january  and on january   imation filed its notice of appeal with the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on december   mbi filed two patent related summary judgment motions 
a hearing on these motions was held on january  the court has not yet ruled on these motions 
although all litigation carries risk  we continue to aggressively dispute philips claims 
given the present status of the proceedings  there currently is no probable or estimable liability 
discovery is ongoing and trial of the matter is currently scheduled for fall in the interim  the parties may continue to conduct settlement discussions 
although the company is not a party to this lawsuit  on august   philips initiated a lawsuit against moser baer india ltd 
mbi in the hague  netherlands  based on mbi s optical license agreements with philips 
mbi has made a claim for indemnification of its legal expenses and potential liabilities for damages that may be incurred with respect to this claim as well as the us litigation described above 
imation has made payments to mbi and accrued liabilities in connection with a portion of mbi s legal fees incurred with respect to the philips litigation 
we continue to review mbi s claims for reimbursement to determine the extent of our obligations under the relevant agreements with mbi 
sandisk on october   sandisk corporation filed a patent infringement action in us district court  western district of wisconsin  against imation and its subsidiaries  imation enterprises corp 
and memorex products  inc the lawsuit also names over twenty other companies as defendants 
this action alleges that we have infringed five patents held by sandisk us patent     and  sandisk alleges that our sale of various flash memory products  such as usb flash drives and certain flash card formats  infringes these patents and is seeking damages for prior sales  and an injunction and or royalties on future sales 
this action has been stayed pending resolution of the related case described below 

table of contents also on october   sandisk filed a complaint with the united states international trade commission itc against the same imation entities listed above  as well as over twenty other companies 
this action involves the same patents and the same products as described above and sandisk is seeking an order from the itc blocking the defendants importation of these products into the united states 
the itc hearing was held october  through november  prior to the hearing  sandisk affirmatively withdrew three of the five patents us nos 
  and  from the case 
on november   the itc investigative staff counsel released its post hearing brief recommending that us patent no 
 be found invalid and that us patent no 
 be found valid and infringed 
the itc judge will consider the itc staff counsel s recommendation  and the briefs of the other parties  and will issue an initial determination by april  the final determination of the itc should follow four months later  in august  and an exclusion order  if any  would likely take effect two months later  in october some of our suppliers are already licensed by sandisk 
we are also generally indemnified by our suppliers against claims for patent infringement 
additionally  our suppliers have indicated that they will be providing us with usb flash drives with different controllers  which sandisk has stipulated are not covered by us patent no 
 well prior to any action by the itc 
therefore  at this time we do not believe that either of the sandisk actions will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to be read in conjunction with item business  the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading global marketer and developer of products in digital storage  audio and video electronics and accessories that enable people to capture  save and enjoy digital information 
the primary brand names under which our products are sold are imation  memorex  tdk life on record and xtrememac 
we sell removable data storage media products in approximately countries around the world and under several different brand names across multiple technology platforms or pillars magnetic media  recordable optical media  usb flash drives and external and removable hard drives 
we also sell a range of audio and video consumer electronic products and accessories primarily in north america and primarily under the memorex brand name 
except for certain magnetic tape media formats  we do not manufacture the products we sell and distribute 
we seek to differentiate these products through unique designs  product positioning  packaging  merchandising and branding 
we source these products from a variety of third party manufacturers 
in addition to overall industry trends described under business in item of this form k  we have seen unexpected softness in the markets we participated in during we expect these negative trends to continue in the significant and rapid downturn in the global economy has negatively affected demand for both our commercial and consumer product lines  and is impacting suppliers  distributors and channel partners 
these impacts  in many cases  have been of greater magnitude than we had expected and are of longer duration 
for example  as a result of the financial market turmoil data center customers in several large banks and financial services firms scaled back  deferred or stopped purchase activity altogether 
this impacted tape sales for some of our highest margin products 
in addition  consumer spending has slowed globally in  which impacted sales of our consumer electronic products 
strategy our long term strategy is built upon three key elements which we describe as optimize  grow and extend 
optimize our magnetic tape business 
the magnetic tape market remains an attractive market for imation because of our significant market share  brand and product portfolio  intellectual property  solid industry reputation and relationships among key original equipment manufacturers oems  global distribution  and manufacturing capability 
there is growing demand for data storage capacity across a substantial installed base of commercial information technology users  a relatively small number of competitors  and high barriers to entry 
at the same time  it is highly competitive  and the overall market size  in terms of revenue  is declining 
in may of we started a major restructuring of our manufacturing operations to optimize our magnetic tape business and stabilize or reduce our manufacturing costs 
as a result we are concentrating our direct manufacturing investments on coating operations and outsourcing other parts of manufacturing operations for magnetic tape 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we continue to invest broadly in tape technology and seek to maintain and extend value added technology capabilities in key areas  including precision thin film tape coating and servo writing 
grow the data storage media business across the four pillars of storage offering products under multiple brands 
over the years  we have brought to market recordable media products beyond magnetic tape  including recordable optical media  removable usb flash drives and flash cards  solid state drives  and external and removable hard disk products 
we have also acquired additional brands  beyond the imation brand  and established distribution agreements for other brands  as described above 
the strength of our brands has allowed us to gain market share in the world wide optical media markets 
in addition  with over half of our revenue coming from outside the united states  we seek to leverage our global marketing and distribution capability in bringing products to market across multiple geographies 

table of contents extend certain brands selectively across multiple product categories 
we sell accessories and certain consumer electronic products  selectively  under multiple brands in various regions of the world 
with the acquisition of memcorp we entered into the consumer electronics market to sell certain products which we did not offer previously 
our product portfolio includes tvs and digital displays  including flat panel liquid crystal displays lcd and digital picture frames  ipod accessories  clock radios and mp players 
the portfolio also includes home theater video  portable and fashion dvd players  karaoke systems and office products such as voice recorders 
the xtrememac acquisition provided a broader product set and greater distribution presence targeting apple ipod  iphone and apple tv users 
while retaining our tape media business as a cornerstone of the company  we are transforming the company into a brand and product management company  with the majority of our products sold to individual consumers  primarily through retail distribution channels 
we have taken several actions which have significantly increased our industry presence and relevance in both commercial and consumer retail channels and markets globally  to broaden the scope of our business and to address the large and growing consumer market for data storage media and audio video consumer electronics and accessories 
the more important actions driving this change over the past five years include the following we entered into a series of agreements with moser baer india ltd 
mbi in that established mbi as a significant  non exclusive source for our optical media products and created a joint venture sales and distribution company  global data media gdm 
we hold a percent interest in gdm 
as the controlling shareholder of the subsidiary  gdm s results are consolidated into our financial statements 
an agreement with ibm in established us as the exclusive global distributor for ibm branded tape media products  whether manufactured by imation or others 
on april   we acquired substantially all of the assets of memorex international inc memorex  including the memorex brand name and the capital stock of its operating subsidiaries engaged in the business of the design  development  sourcing  marketing  distribution and sale of hardware  media and accessories used for the storage of electronic data under the memorex brand name 
this action strengthened our position in optical products and accessories  especially in the united states retail channel 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
on july   we acquired memcorp 
this action established our foundation in the consumer electronic products in the mass merchant channel and enabled us to better manage the memorex brand name across all retail channels in the united states

during the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million consisting of a full impairment of the goodwill associated with our americas consumer and europe reporting units 
the goodwill impairments in resulted from a general decline in the outlook for profitability for the products sold by our americas consumer and europe reporting units combined with the fact that a market participant s view of our fair value was substantially reduced as reflected by the decline in our stock price

this program began in the third quarter of when our board of directors approved the camarillo  california restructuring plan as further implementation of our manufacturing strategy 
we ended manufacturing at our camarillo plant and have exited the facility as of december  we will focus our manufacturing efforts on magnetic tape coating operations at our existing plant in weatherford  oklahoma 
the plant closing resulted in the elimination of approximately positions  of which were included under previously announced programs 
we expect exit of the camarillo plant to result in approximately million to million in annualized cost eliminations intended to partially mitigate projected declines in tape gross profits in future years

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances 
we record income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas requires a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the sfas more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused  and tax planning alternatives 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million of which relates to deferred tax assets in the united states 
these net deferred tax assets are net of valuation allowances of million 
the valuation allowance relates to various worldwide operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize 
based on our assessment  it appears more likely than not that the recorded net deferred tax asset at december  will be realized through future taxable earnings 
we will continue to assess the required valuation allowance in the future 
in a tax jurisdiction with a net deferred tax asset  the considerations for determining whether the more likely than not criterion is met  include  whether there has been cumulative profit defined as pre tax income adjusted by permanent differences over the preceding three year period 
our analysis of the need for a valuation allowance recognizes that while we have reported a consolidated cumulative loss over the three year period ended december  this loss includes goodwill impairments which are nondeductible permanent differences 
excluding these nondeductible permanent differences  we have a consolidated cumulative profit over the most recent three year period and cumulative three year profit  excluding nondeductible permanent differences  in all tax jurisdictions where a net deferred tax asset is recorded 
while we have a history of profits  our profitability has declined over the last three years and we recorded a loss in the current year in the united states where the majority of our deferred tax assets are recorded 
therefore achievement of the expected profitability in the united states in will be a significant factor in determining our continuing ability to carry these deferred tax assets 
significant negative events could impact the ability to carry the deferred tax assets in future periods 

table of contents we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results  including further market deterioration  may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
if future results from our operations are less than projected particularly in our primary markets  a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets  which could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period in which it is recorded 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
these tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if recognized 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
fiscal years and remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service 
the years through remain subject to examination by foreign tax jurisdictions and state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdictions 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense 
within the next months  we do not expect that our unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly 
litigation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record a liability when a loss from litigation is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
based upon information presently available  management believes that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
while these matters could materially affect operating results in future periods depending on the final resolution  it is our opinion that after final disposition  any monetary liability to us beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to our financial position except for the philips dispute 
imation believes that philips claims are without merit and consequently there is no probable or estimable liability 
see item legal proceedings for a description of our dispute with philips 
as additional information becomes available  the potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates will be revised as necessary 
goodwill and other intangibles 
we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  the determination of useful lives of intangible assets and subsequent impairment analyses require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under certain situations  interim impairment tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
other intangible assets are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 

table of contents intangible assets are amortized using methods that approximate the benefit provided by utilization of the assets 
in determining the useful life of a trade name  we consider the following the overall strength of the trade name in the market in terms of market awareness and market share  the length of time that the trade name has been in existence  the period of time over which the trade name is expected to remain in use and the strength of the trade name and its perseverance through changes in the data storage industry 
in determining the useful lives of other intangible assets  we consider the period over which a majority of the economic benefits provided by the asset will be realized by the company 
we periodically review the carrying value of our long lived assets including intangible assets to test whether current events or circumstances indicate that such carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the tests indicate that the carrying value of the asset is greater than the expected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset  an impairment loss would be recognized which is determined as the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units in which we have recorded goodwill 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management on a regular basis 
we have determined that our reporting units are our segments with the exception of the americas data storage media segment which is further divided between the americas consumer and americas commercial reporting units 
inherent in the determination of fair value of our reporting units are certain estimates and judgments  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations as well as our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with the annual test of goodwill impairment  impairments were identified and recorded in an aggregate amount of million related to the americas commercial  asia pacific and electronic products reporting units 
we had previously performed an interim test for impairment at september  and determined that no impairments were present 
during the fourth quarter  the continuing and accelerating deterioration of general economic conditions including shortfalls against our anticipated fourth quarter operating profitability resulted in lower expectations for growth and profitability in future periods 
in addition  we experienced a decline in our stock price reflecting a further reduction in a market participant s view of fair value of our underlying reporting units 
during the fourth quarter of  in conjunction with our annual test of goodwill impairment  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million consisting of a full impairment of the goodwill associated with our americas consumer and europe reporting units 
the goodwill impairments in resulted from a general decline in the outlook for profitability for the products sold by our americas consumer and europe reporting units combined with the fact that a market participant s view of our fair value was substantially reduced reflected by a decline in our stock price 
in evaluating whether goodwill was impaired  we compared the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned to their carrying value step of the impairment test 
in calculating fair value  we used a weighting of the valuations calculated using market multiples and the income approach 
the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecasts 
future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate fair value 
the market approach establishes fair value by comparing our company to other publicly traded guideline companies or by analysis of actual transactions of similar businesses or assets sold 
in determining the fair value of reporting units  we weighted values under the income approach percent and values determined from market comparables percent 
the summation of our reporting units fair values is compared and reconciled to our market capitalization as of the date of our impairment test 
in the situation where a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the measurement of the impairment step of the impairment test is calculated by determining the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill 
in calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 

table of contents in determining the fair value of our reporting units under the income approach  our expected cash flows are affected by various assumptions 
fair value on a discounted cash flow basis uses forecasts over a year period with an estimation of residual growth rates thereafter 
we use management business plans and projections as the basis for expected future cash flows 
the significant assumptions incorporated in these forecasts for the most recent goodwill impairment tests included annual revenue changes in future period from percent to percent for americas commercial  from percent to percent for asia pacific and from percent to percent for electronic products 
terminal growth rates of zero to four percent were used for all reporting units 
discount rates of percent were used for all reporting units other than electronic products which used a market participant rate of percent to reflect the relevant risks of the higher growth assumed for this reporting unit 
the selection of discount rates has a significant impact on the determination of fair value 
an increase or decrease of one percent in the discount rate would have had no impact on the impairments recorded for americas commercial and asia pacific  however  an increase in the discount rate of one percent would have increased the impairment in the electronic products by million while a decrease in the discount rate by one percent would have decreased the impairment charge in this reporting unit by million 
there are also various assumptions used under the market approach that affect the valuation of our reporting units 
the most significant assumptions are market multiples and control premium 
in estimating the fair value of our company under the market approach  we considered the relative merits of commonly applied market capitalization multiples based on the availability of data 
based on our analysis  we determined the market value of invested capital to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization multiple to be the most appropriate valuation multiple to be applied in the application of the market approach 
as a result of our analysis of fair value from the combination of our discounted cash flow modeling and market comparisons  we utilized an implied stock price of per share at november  in determining and allocating fair value to our reporting units as compared to a market price of per share on the november  testing date for goodwill impairment 
a control premium of percent was used in our determination of fair value which represents the value an investor would pay above minority interest transaction prices in order to obtain a controlling interest in the company 
the control premium was determined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years 
an increase in the assumed control premium by percent to percent would have decreased the impairment charge in by approximately million while a decrease in the assumed control premium by percent to percent would have increased the impairment by million 
after considering the goodwill impairments recorded in fiscal years and  remaining goodwill in the amount of million relates to our electronic products reporting unit 
while management s most recent analyses indicates that this goodwill is not impaired  to the extent that assumptions about future economic conditions or potential for our growth and profitability in this business changes  it is possible that our conclusion regarding the remaining goodwill could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we extend credit to our customers in the normal course of business 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses based upon our loss history and our aging analysis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review the allowance for doubtful accounts each reporting period based on a detailed analysis of our accounts receivable 
in the analysis  we primarily consider the age of the customer s receivable and also consider the creditworthiness of the customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and general economic conditions  among other factors 
if any of these factors change  we may also change our original estimates  which could impact the level of our future allowance for doubtful accounts 
if payment is not made timely  we will contact the customer to try to obtain payment 
once all collection efforts are exhausted  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
excess inventory and obsolescence accruals 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolescence to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  adjustments to these reserves may be required 
as of december   the excess inventory and obsolescence accrual was million 

table of contents rebates 
we maintain an accrual for customer rebates that totaled million as of december  included in other current liabilities 
this accrual requires a program by program estimation of outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit sell through volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
other accrued liabilities 
we also have other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to us 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on our assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and projected salary increases 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is december see note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosures of these assumptions for both the us and international plans 
the discount rate assumptions are tied to portfolios of long term high quality bonds and are  therefore  subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate used in calculating the benefit obligation in the united states was percent at december   as compared to percent at december  a discount rate reduction of percent decreases us pension plan expense pre tax by approximately million 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the investment portfolios for the pension plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the respective portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
we use historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the rate of return used in calculating the pension expense for  and was percent 
a change of percent for the expected return on plan assets assumption will impact united states net pension plan expense pre tax by million 
expected returns on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the united states plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
in the united states  we have used the rate of percent for the past three years 
mortality assumptions were obtained from the irs static mortality table

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk 
international operations  which comprised approximately percent of our revenue in  may be subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations 
the additional risks include political and economic instability  terrorist activity  the possibility of expropriation  trade tariffs or embargoes  unfavorable tax laws  restrictions on royalties  dividends and currency remittances  requirements for governmental approvals for new ventures and local participation in operations such as local equity ownership and workers councils 
our foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of the foreign currency risks over near term periods  however  we cannot ensure that these risk management activities will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
although we attempt to utilize hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which we sell products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which we incur costs  our revenue or costs are adversely impacted 
in accordance with established policies and procedures  we may utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options  combination option strategies and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging include the accuracy of our forecasts  the volatility of the currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 
the utilization of derivatives and hedging activities is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
an immediate adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables including interest rates held constant would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million 
we are exposed to credit risk associated with cash investments and foreign currency derivatives 
we do not believe that our cash investments and foreign currency derivatives present significant credit risks because the counterparties to the instruments consist of major financial institutions and we monitor and manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with each counterparty
