item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in part ii  item of this report 
overview of our business shoe carnival  inc is one of the nation s largest family footwear retailers 
as of january   we operated stores in states primarily in the midwest  south and southeast regions of the united states 
we offer a distinctive shopping experience  a broad merchandise assortment and value to our customers while maintaining an efficient store level cost structure 
our stores combine competitive pricing with a highly promotional  in store marketing effort that encourages customer participation and creates a fun and exciting shopping experience 
we believe this highly promotional atmosphere results in various competitive advantages  including increased multiple unit sales  the building of a loyal  repeat customer base  the creation of word of mouth advertising  and enhanced sell through of in season goods 
our objective is to be the destination store of choice for a wide range of consumers seeking moderately priced  current season name brand and private label footwear 
our product assortment includes dress and casual shoes  sandals  boots and a wide assortment of athletic shoes for the entire family 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of both athletic and non athletic footwear  we are able to reduce our exposure to shifts in fashion preferences between those categories 
our marketing effort targets moderate income  value conscious consumers seeking name brand footwear for all age groups 
we believe that by offering a wide selection of popular styles of name brand merchandise at competitive prices  we generate broad customer appeal 
our cost efficient store operations and real estate strategy enable us to price products competitively 
low labor costs are achieved by housing merchandise directly on the selling floor in an open stock format  enabling customers to serve themselves  if they choose 
this reduces the staffing required to assist customers and reduces store level labor costs as a percentage of sales 
we locate stores predominantly in strip shopping centers in order to take advantage of lower occupancy costs and maximize our exposure to value oriented shoppers 
in fiscal  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  which was to terminate upon the earlier of the repurchase of the maximum amount or december  on october   the board of directors extended the date of termination one year to december  share repurchases under this authorization may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements and other market conditions 
as of january   approximately million shares had been repurchased at an aggregate cost of million 
the amount that remained available under the existing repurchase authorization at january  was million 
our fiscal year is a week year ending on the saturday closest to january unless otherwise stated  references to years     and  relate respectively to the fiscal years ended january   february   february   january   and january  fiscal year consisted of weeks and the other fiscal years consisted of weeks 
executive summary fiscal  and especially the second half of the year  proved to be a difficult economic environment during which our targeted moderate income consumer further reduced their discretionary spending 
consequently  like many retailers in the united states  we experienced a continuing decline in customer traffic which negatively impacted our business 
this resulted in a comparable store sales decrease of for the year 
sales results by product category were uneven during the fiscal year 
weakness throughout the year in our non athletic product categories  particularly women s non athletic  accounted for approximately of the comparable store sales decline for the year 
athletic sales saw benefit from the economic stimulus checks in the second quarter along with the need presented by the back to school period  resulting in a comparable store sales increase through august 
however  as the economic climate worsened in the second half of the fiscal year  and particularly in the fourth quarter  we saw our athletic category accelerate in comparable store sales declines to also end the year negative 
total comparable store sales reached their lowest levels during the fourth quarter  as general economic conditions worsened and consumer confidence continued to deteriorate 
our store managers and merchants worked diligently throughout the year to control inventories 
at the end of each quarter  inventories were at or below the prior year on a per store average 
while the heavily promotional retail environment contributed to the basis point decline in our merchandise margins  we exited fiscal with inventories on a per store basis percent lower than prior year levels 
during fiscal  selling  general and administrative expenses were reduced  from the prior year 
reductions in advertising and employee incentive and benefit costs were able to more than offset the cost of operating an average of more stores and incurring an additional million in store closing costs 
we opened new stores during fiscal  and consistent with our real estate strategy  these stores were located in large and small markets in both new and existing geographic areas 
we continued to fill in under penetrated markets with additional stores and enter smaller one or two store markets 
we closed under performing stores and identified an additional under performing stores for closure in future periods 
during fiscal  we were able to generate free cash flow of million and end the year with million in cash and cash equivalents and no interest bearing debt 
we realize the current level of economic uncertainty and rising unemployment within the us marketplace has altered the spending habits of most consumers and we believe the economy will continue to have a negative impact on customer traffic during fiscal therefore  we intend to scale back plans to open new stores  significantly reduce capital expenditures  slightly lower per store inventories from fiscal levels and maintain tight control over expense 
we believe these are tremendously important strategies during what we expect to be a volatile year in retail 
through proper execution  we expect to continue to generate free cash flow and maintain a debt free balance sheet 
critical accounting policies it is necessary for us to include certain judgments in our reported financial results 
these judgments involve estimates that are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the accounting policies that require the more significant judgments are merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
in determining market value  we estimate the future sales price of items of merchandise contained in the inventory as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in this determination include  among others  current and recently recorded sales prices  the length of time product has been held in inventory and quantities of various product styles contained in inventory 
the ultimate amount realized from the sale of certain product could differ materially from our estimates 
we also estimate a shrinkage reserve for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and annually when no such event has occurred 
we evaluate the ongoing value of assets associated with retail stores that have been open longer than one year 
when events such as these occur  the assets subject to impairment are adjusted to estimated fair value and  if applicable  an impairment loss is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment  including current and future economic trends for stores  are subject to a high degree of judgment and if actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated  additional losses may be recorded 
income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
and account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
fin 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the estimated tax rates in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
under fin  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations are often complex  ambiguous and change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
insurance reserves we use a combination of self insurance and third party insurance for workers compensation  employee medical and general liability insurance 
these plans have stop loss provisions that protect us from individual and aggregate losses over specified dollar values 
when estimating our self insured liabilities  we consider a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  statistical trends and  in certain instances  valuation assistance provided by independent third parties 
we will continue to evaluate our self insured liabilities and the underlying assumptions on a quarterly basis and make adjustments as needed 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimating process 
in the event we determine an accrual should be increased or reduced  we will record such adjustments in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the following fiscal years fiscal years net sales cost of sales including buying  distribution  and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income in the regular course of business  we offer our customers sales incentives including coupons  discounts  and free merchandise 
sales are recorded net of such incentives and returns and allowances 
if an incentive involves free merchandise  that merchandise is recorded as a zero sale and the cost is included in cost of sales 
comparable store sales for the periods indicated below include stores that have been open for full months prior to the beginning of the period  including those stores that have been relocated or remodeled 
therefore  stores opened or closed during the periods indicated are not included in comparable store sales 
compared to net sales net sales decreased million to million in fiscal  a decrease from net sales of million in fiscal comparable store sales decreased  or approximately million  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in net sales was partially offset by a million increase in sales generated by the stores opened in fiscal and the effect of a full year s worth of sales for the stores opened in fiscal  net of the sales loss from the stores which were closed during the last two years 
gross profit gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal  a decrease from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin decreased compared to the prior year  while buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased 
as was seen across the retail sector  heavy promotions throughout the year were necessary to keep inventory turning at an acceptable level and consequently negatively impacted margins 
we experienced a increase in occupancy costs  as a percentage of sales  primarily as a result of the lower comparable store sales  an increase in costs due to the additional stores we operated throughout the year and additional store closing costs 
this increase  as a percentage of sales  was partially offset by a decline in distribution costs 
our distribution costs  both as a percentage of sales and in dollars  declined as a result of the increased costs associated with the conversion to our new distribution center during the first quarter of the prior year  a reduction in volume for fiscal and increased efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal the savings in dollars was primarily the result of a million reduction in advertising costs from our decision to decrease advertising during non peak periods along with a million decrease in the expense for employee incentives and benefits 
these decreases were partially offset by million of additional costs incurred from the operation and support of the net new stores opened since the beginning of fiscal pre opening costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  in both fiscal and in fiscal we opened stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
the total amount of pre opening expense incurred will vary by store depending on the specific market and the promotional activities involved 
our average pre opening costs per store were  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the portion of store closing costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was million  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to the closing of stores in fiscal and the impairment and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores at future dates 
in fiscal  we incurred million  or as a percentage of sales  in costs related to the closing of five stores in fiscal and the impairment and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close certain underperforming stores at future dates 
currently  we have identified stores to close in fiscal  eight in fiscal  four in fiscal  and one in fiscal we are currently accelerating applicable expenses on all of these stores 
we will continue to evaluate underperforming stores for possible closing on a routine basis  which may result in the identification of additional store closings for the current or future fiscal years 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets to be disposed of at closing and the amount of any lease buyout 
interest income and expense interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the rate available on investments 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit and tax credits 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded  of state tax credits related to the investment in our new distribution center  which was the primary factor in reducing our effective tax rate in fiscal compared to net sales net sales decreased million to million in fiscal  a decrease from net sales of million in fiscal comparable store sales for the week period ended february  decreased  or approximately million  compared to the week period ended february  this decrease in net sales was partially offset by a million increase in sales generated by the stores opened in fiscal and the effect of a full year s worth of sales for the stores opened in fiscal  net of the sales loss from the stores which were closed during the same periods 
additional sales of approximately million were recorded in the rd week of fiscal we believe the constriction of the general economy during fiscal directly affected our target customer through higher gasoline prices  escalating food costs  housing and mortgage issues and increased consumer debt loads 
these conditions had a direct negative impact on traffic in our stores  and consequently  resulted in lower sales for fiscal the decline in comparable store sales was broad based  with all product categories experiencing a decline 
gross profit gross profit decreased million to million in fiscal  a decrease from gross profit of million in fiscal the gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal as a percentage of sales  the merchandise margin remained unchanged compared to the prior year  while buying  distribution and occupancy costs increased 
an increase in occupancy costs related primarily to the operation of net new stores coupled with declining sales accounted for of the increase 
the remaining was primarily related to increases in fixed distribution costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during fiscal from in fiscal pre opening costs were million  or of sales  in fiscal as compared to  or of sales in fiscal we opened stores in fiscal as compared to stores in fiscal pre opening costs  such as advertising  payroll and supplies  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense in the period they are incurred 
our average pre opening costs per store were  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising expenditures 
the portion of store closing costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal was million  or as a percentage of sales 
these costs related to five fiscal store closings and the impairment and acceleration of expenses associated with management s determination to close stores in fiscal  four in fiscal and one each in fiscal and in fiscal  we incurred  or as a percentage of sales  in store closing costs related to six fiscal store closings and an impairment charge for one store 
the timing and actual amount of expense recorded in closing a store can vary significantly on a store by store basis depending  in part  on the period in which management commits to a closing plan  the remaining basis in the fixed assets at the store and any amounts required to be paid as part of the lease termination 
additional significant items associated with this net increase in selling  general and administrative expenses included million of additional expense to operate and support the net new stores stores opened since the beginning of fiscal  net of store closings  which was partially offset by million in comparable store expense savings primarily attributable to variable expense controls along with a million decrease in performance based incentive compensation expense 
the increase in costs associated with providing general and administrative services to the corporation account for the balance of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and are not materially significant as individual items 
interest income and expense interest income decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average cash and cash equivalents balances available for investment purposes throughout fiscal interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate was for fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate for both years differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state and local income taxes  net of the federal tax benefit and tax credits 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded  of state tax credits related to the investment in our new distribution center  which was the primary factor in reducing the company s effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal discontinued operations we evaluate our store closings for discontinued operations classification utilizing the guidance within fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
based on this evaluation  we have determined that each of our stores is the lowest level at which the operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the rest of the company 
although each of our stores  on its own  is a component of the company  there may be cases in which we expect significant sales from store closures to transfer to our other existing stores that we continue to operate 
in these cases  we believe the operations and cash flows from the store closures will not be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the company  and should not be classified as discontinued operations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
the following table summarizes our discontinued operations for the years ended january   february  and february  in thousands  except per store data fiscal years total stores closed during year stores closed in which sales transferred to existing store locations discontinued operations stores net sales for discontinued operations stores   net loss for discontinued operations stores  net of tax  these stores are not located near other existing stores to facilitate transference of sales nor do we have significant continuing involvement in their operations after closing 
we have not segregated the results of operations for these stores in our consolidated financial statements as the amounts are deemed immaterial 
liquidity and capital resources our sources and uses of cash are summarized as follows s fiscal years net income plus depreciation and amortization   deferred income taxes  lease incentives  changes in operating assets and liabilities    other operating activities   net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities   net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   our primary sources of funds are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal these amounts reflect the income from operations adjusted for non cash items and working capital changes 
this increase in cash provided by operations  when comparing the two periods of each year  was primarily due to a reduction in inventory on a per store basis and the timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by a decrease in net income 
working capital increased to million at january  from million at february  this was primarily attributable to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a million decrease in accounts payable partially offset by an million decrease in merchandise inventories 
the current ratio at january  was and for february  was we had no outstanding interest bearing debt at january  or february  capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal no capital lease obligations were incurred during this three year period 
of the fiscal capital expenditures  approximately million was used for new stores  million was used for remodels and relocations and million was used for technology 
the remaining capital expenditures for fiscal were used for in store graphics  fixture improvements and normal asset replacement activities 
lease incentives received from landlords were million   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures are expected to be million to million in fiscal we intend to open approximately stores at an expected total cost of approximately million in fiscal we anticipate the remediation to the distribution center will cost up to million 
the remaining capital expenditures are expected to be incurred for store remodels and various other store improvements  along with continued investments in technology and normal asset replacement activities 
the actual amount of cash required for capital expenditures for store operations depends in part on the number of new stores opened  the amount of lease incentives  if any  received from landlords and the number of stores remodeled 
the opening of new stores will be dependent upon  among other things  the availability of desirable locations  and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms and general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending in areas we target for expansion 
our current store prototype uses between  and  square feet depending upon  among other factors  the location of the store and the population base the store is expected to service 
capital expenditures for a new store in fiscal are expected to average approximately  the average inventory investment in a new store is expected to range from  to  depending on the size and sales expectation of the store and the timing of the new store opening 
pre opening expenses  such as advertising  salaries and supplies  are expected to average approximately  per store in fiscal on a per store basis  for the stores opened during fiscal  the initial inventory investment averaged  capital expenditures averaged  and lease incentives received from landlords averaged significant contractual obligations as of january  and the fiscal years in which payments are due include s payments due by fiscal year and contractual obligations total after letters of credit   operating leases      purchase commitments   deferred compensation   fin liabilities   total contractual obligations    our unsecured credit facility provides for up to million in cash advances on a revolving basis and both commercial and standby letters of credit 
borrowings under the revolving credit line are based on eligible inventory 
the agreement governing the credit facility stipulates that total shareholders equity  adjusted for the effect of any share repurchases  will not fall below that of the prior fiscal year end  the ratio of funded debt plus rent to ebitda plus rent will not exceed to  total distributions for stock repurchases will not exceed million and cash dividends will not reduce our total shareholders equity  adjusted for the effect of any share repurchases  below that of the prior fiscal year end 
we were in compliance with these requirements as of january  should a default condition be reported  the lenders may preclude additional borrowings and call all loans and accrued interest at their discretion 
the credit agreement and amendments thereto are filed as exhibits to or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and letters of credit outstanding were million at january  estimated interest payments on our line of credit are not included in the above table as our line of credit is subject to frequent borrowing and or repayment activities which does not lend itself to reliable forecasting for disclosure purposes 
as of january   million was available to us for additional borrowings under the credit facility 
on december   the credit agreement was amended to extend the maturity date to april  and to allow us to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock in an amount not to exceed million 
in december  the board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program  which was to terminate on the earlier of the repurchase of the maximum amount or december  on october   the board of directors extended the date of termination one year to december  as of january   approximately million shares had been repurchased at an aggregate cost of million 
the amount that remained available under the existing repurchase authorization at january  was million 
on or about april   an arbitration claim was filed by sdi industries  inc sdi against us with the american arbitration association western case management center in los angeles  california  captioned sdi industries  inc claimant and counter respondent v 
shoe carnival  inc respondent and counterclaimant  in which sdi seeks payment of million of unpaid retainage   for services it has not yet billed  plus additional interest and legal fees 
the retainage was withheld from progress billings for work performed on our new distribution center and is recorded in accrued and other liabilities and fixed assets in our consolidated financial statements 
on or about may   we filed a counterclaim and response in this matter  denying sdi s claim  and seeking monetary damages of more than million 
we contend that sdi breached the contract due to their failure to deliver our distribution center s material handling system pursuant to the specifications of the contract 
the hearing before the arbitration panel is currently scheduled for july although the investment we made in the new distribution center will satisfy our distribution needs throughout fiscal  we have not achieved the productivity that we expect will be required in three to five years  based on our long term store growth plan 
we have contracted with a company to provide recommendations as to system upgrades to improve throughput 
modifications are tentatively expected to be complete prior to the end of fiscal we anticipate that our existing cash and cash flow from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our revolving credit line  will be sufficient to fund our planned store expansion along with other capital expenditures  any future repurchase of our common stock under our current repurchase plan and other operating cash requirements for at least the next months 
see note long term debt  note leases  note income taxes and note employee benefit plans to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for a further discussion of our contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not assign any store operating leases to separate third parties during fiscal we remain liable on three assignments of operating leases covering former store locations 
we believe that the likelihood of material liability being triggered under these leases is remote  and no liability has been accrued for these contingent lease obligations in our consolidated financial statements as of january  see note leases to our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
except for the assignment of certain store operating leases and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal or fiscal  nor did we have any off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at january  or february  seasonality our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated  and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future  primarily as a result of seasonal variances and the timing of sales and costs associated with opening new stores 
non capital expenditures  such as advertising and payroll  incurred prior to the opening of a new store are charged to expense as incurred 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected in any quarter in which we incur pre opening expenses related to the opening of new stores 
we have three distinct peak selling periods easter  back to school and christmas 
new accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our operations are contained in note summary of significant accounting policies  contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in that the interest payable on our credit facility is based on variable interest rates and therefore is affected by changes in market rates 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in market interest rates 
a change in the weighted average interest rate charged under the credit facility would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating by less than  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal
