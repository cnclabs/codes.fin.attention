prior to  substantially all of our net revenue was derived from the commissions we earned on the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties 
since  we have added multiple sources of revenue  including lead development services and hosted application software 
background we completed our initial public offering in november  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
during the period from the initial public offering through  we focused on expanding our market share of the sale of service contracts for our clients 
in february  we completed our first acquisition  sunset direct  which added a new service offering the generation of sales leads  or lead generation  for clients 
sunset direct provided us with new clients for our service contract sales solution 
we relocated most of our operations from california to sunset direct s lower cost location in texas 
our net revenues grew to million in from million in this growth was due both to million  or  year over year growth excluding acquisitions in our service contract sales solution and million from our lead development services 
in  we incurred losses of million  due in part to redundancy  severance and other transition costs incurred in moving our base of operations to texas 
we achieved our first profitable quarter in the period ended march  due primarily to revenue growth from existing and new customers and the lower costs resulting from the relocation of our operations to texas 
our acquisition of viewcentral in september added hosted application software for training sales to 
table of contents our service offerings and a significant new customer base 
we reported net revenue of million for the year  representing year over year growth  excluding acquisitions  of  in addition to the million of net revenue from our hosted application software for training sales offering 
we were profitable in each quarter of and reported net income of million for the year 
in january  we acquired cas systems to provide additional complementary lead development functionality  customers  execution expertise and an international presence with its location near montreal  canada 
in july  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of qinteraction limited  which operates an offshore call center located in the philippines 
qinteraction provides a variety of business solutions including inbound sales and order taking  inbound customer care  outbound telemarketing and lead generation  logistics support  and back office processing 
the nature of these services are highly complimentary to our existing lead development and contract sales product offerings 
we reported net revenue of million in  representing a decline over the prior year 
we reported a net loss of million for the year 
in february  we received written notification from dell  our then largest customer  that they would be terminating our service agreement 
for the year ended december   dell accounted for of our net revenue 
during the year ended december   dell accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
excluding dell  we reported net revenue of million in  and million in  representing a increase over the prior year 
net revenue we derive revenue from the following the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties contract sales  from the provision of services related to the development of qualified leads and appointments lead development  and from the licensing of our hosted application software platform for our clients training sales training sales 
service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions contract sales 
we sell  on behalf of our clients  service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions and warranty extensions 
we earn commissions on the sale of these services to our clients customers  which we report as our revenue 
we are typically responsible for the complete sales process  including marketing and customer identification and order processing 
we also take responsibility for collecting the amount paid by our client s customer 
as a result  when we complete a sale  we record the full amount of the sale on our balance sheet as accounts receivable 
we record revenue for the commissions we earn on the transaction  which is based on a fixed percentage of the renewal amount based on the agreement with our client 
we record the difference between the sale amount and our commission as an account payable  representing the amount we will remit to our client according to our payment terms  generally to days from the initial sale 
our clients customers pay us by credit card  check or on payment terms which are generally days from sale  and none of our clients customers represented more than of our revenue 
because our revenue from sales of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions are commission based  this revenue can vary significantly 
our agreements with our clients for these services typically have two to three year terms  with automatic renewal provisions 
these agreements are generally terminable on to days notice by either party 
we recently started to provide hosted application software which enables our clients resellers to renew service contracts with end users directly 
in these situations we earn commissions on sales by our clients or their resellers but take no responsibility or credit risk for collection from the end user of the services 
lead development 
we provide lead development services to generate  qualify and develop corporate leads  turning these prospects into sales opportunities and qualified appointments for our clients field sales forces and for their channel partners 
our agreements with our clients are generally for fixed fees  have terms ranging from three months to one year and require us to provide fixed resources for the term of the contract 

table of contents some of our contracts contain performance requirements 
for the significant majority of our lead generation agreements  we recognize revenue as our services are provided  for our performance based contracts  we recognize revenue as we meet the performance objectives 
to the extent that our clients pay us in advance of the provision of services  we record deferred revenue and recognize the revenue ratably over the contract period 
application software training sales 
we license our hosted application software that our clients use to manage their online and in person training programs 
the licenses are usually for one year terms  and are often paid in advance 
these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
gross margin gross margin is calculated as net revenue less the costs associated with selling our clients products or delivering our services to our clients 
cost of services include compensation costs of sales personnel  sales commissions and bonuses  costs of designing  producing and delivering marketing services  credit card fees  bad debts  and salaries and other personnel expenses related to fee based activities 
costs of services also include the cost of allocated facility and telephone usage for our telesales representatives as well as other direct costs associated with the delivery of our services 
cost of services related to training sales relates primarily to the cost of personnel to support our hosted application 
most of the costs of services are personnel related and are mostly variable in relation to our net revenue 
bonuses and sales commissions will typically change in proportion to net revenue or profitability 
commission and bonus expense included in gross margin are related to incentives paid to our telesales representatives for incremental sales of our clients contracts and leads generated 
our gross margins will fluctuate in the future with changes in our product mix 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses are primarily costs associated with client acquisition  including compensation costs of marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  bonuses  marketing and promotional expenses  participation in trade shows and conferences and client integration costs 
commission expense included in sales and marketing expenses relates to the variable compensation paid to our sales people who generate sales growth from new and existing clients 
the sales cycle required to generate new clients varies within our product mix 
in some cases  the lead time to create a new client can be substantial and we will incur sales and marketing costs for efforts that may not be successful 
technology and development expenses technology and development expenses include costs associated with the technology infrastructure that supports our rainmaker revenue delivery platform 
these costs include compensation and related costs for technology personnel  consultants  purchases of non capitalizable software and hardware  and support and maintenance costs related to our systems 
we have also invested in the continued development of our revenue delivery platform 
technology and development expenses do not include depreciation of hardware and software systems 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs associated with the administration of our business and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for administrative personnel  insurance  and legal and other professional fees 
most of these costs relate to personnel  insurance and facilities and are relatively fixed 
in we were required to be compliant with the management assessment and auditor attestation provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we incurred substantial additional costs in to achieve this compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
in  our sarbanes oxley related audit expenses decreased as we were not required to have to have an audit of the company s internal controls for the fiscal year as required 
table of contents under section b of sarbanes oxley as our non affiliated market capitalization fell below the million level as of june  and  accordingly  we exited the accelerated filer status as of december  going forward we expect to continue to incur significant costs in general and administrative expenses in future years to maintain compliance 
stock based compensation effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted accounting provisions pursuant to the requirements of sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas r requires us to expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and software licenses  and intangible assets 
we have completed the acquisition of six businesses in the past four years  and accordingly have been increasing our intangible amortization expense 
in the first quarter of  we completed the acquisition of cas systems  and in the third quarter of  we completed the acquisition of qinteraction limited 
we expect amortization expense to decrease significantly in due to the company taking a charge to write down a significant portion of its amortizable intangible assets in the th quarter of see the discussions below regarding the goodwill and other intangible assets and the impairment of goodwill other intangible assets 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net reflects income received on cash and cash equivalents  interest expense on leases to secure equipment  software and other financing agreements  foreign currency gains losses  and other income and expense 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  future results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and has reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we disclosed our critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  management believes there have been no significant changes during the year ended december  use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates 
table of contents on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  measurement of our deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance  allocation of purchase price in business combinations  fair value estimates for the expense of employee stock options 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices 
however  once adopted  these policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy  not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and financial statement presentation substantially all of our revenue is generated from the sale of service contract renewals  lead development services and software licenses for hosted application software for training sales 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our clients service contract renewals under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition and on the net basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
revenue from the sale of service contract renewals is recognized when an order from the client s customer is received  the service contract agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from lead development services we perform is recognized as the services are delivered and is generally earned ratably over the service contract period 
some of our lead development service revenue is earned when we achieve certain attainment levels and is recognized upon customer acceptance of the service 
we earn revenue from our licensing of hosted software applications for training sales ratably over each contract period  having considered eitf application of aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  which distinguishes hosting services that might fall under the scope of sop software revenue recognition 
since these software licenses are usually paid in advance  we record a deferred revenue liability on our balance sheet that represents the prepaid portions of licenses that will be earned over the next one to two years 
we also evaluate our agreements for multiple element arrangements  taking into consideration the guidance from both eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and tpa software revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
our agreements typically do not contain multiple deliverables 
however  in the few instances where our agreements have contained multiple deliverables  they do not have value to our customers on a standalone basis  and therefore the deliverables are considered together as one unit of accounting 
revenue is recorded using a proportional performance model  where revenue is recognized as performance occurs  based on the relative value of the performance that has occurred at that point in time compared to that of the total contract  or deferred until all elements are delivered as appropriate 
our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about collectibility 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and 
table of contents circumstances regarding the business of our clients customer and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in addition we provide an allowance in accrued liabilities for the cancellation of service contracts that occurs within a specified time after the sale  which is typically less than days 
this amount is calculated based on historical results and constitutes a reduction of the net revenue we record for the commission we earn on the sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at december  and  our allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts was  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the guidance of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations in accounting for the assets related to our acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in our analysis of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets we apply the guidance of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
in our analysis of other finite lived amortizable intangible assets  we apply the guidance of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
intangible assets are attributable to the various technologies  customer relationships and trade names of the businesses we have acquired 
in the st quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation required under sfas and concluded that no impairment indicators existed at that time 
in the th quarter of  we changed the annual goodwill impairment evaluation date required under sfas  from january to october to better align this evaluation with our annual planning and budgeting process 
as of october   we started to perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill in accordance with sfas at that time  our initial indications determined that goodwill was impaired 
additionally in the th quarter of  our market capitalization declined significantly with the price of our stock as a result of declining sales and overall market conditions 
due to the decline in our market capitalization at december   depressed market conditions  deteriorating industry trends  and a significant downward revision of our forecasts  we again tested for the potential impairment of goodwill as these were considered triggering events under sfas  and for amortizable intangible assets under sfas prior to our goodwill impairment testing under sfas in the th quarter of  we also assessed the fair value of our long lived assets including our other finite lived amortized intangible assets under sfas based on this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets exceeded their fair value based upon the estimated discounted cash flows related to the assets and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to intangible assets held at the lead development reporting unit  and approximately million related to intangible assets held at the rainmaker asia reporting unit 

table of contents sfas provides for a two step approach to determining whether and by how much goodwill has been impaired 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value 
if the fair value is greater  then no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 
step of the impairment analysis determined that the carrying value of our lead development and rainmaker asia reporting units  subsequent to the impairment of our other finite lived amortizable intangible assets noted above  was greater than their fair value  and that the goodwill relating to these reporting units was impaired 
upon completion of step of the analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million on the lead development reporting unit and approximately million on the rainmaker asia reporting unit  representing the entire balance of goodwill at these reporting units 
the impairment evaluations for goodwill and other intangible assets included reasonable and supportable assumptions and were based on estimates of projected future cash flows 
we report segment results in accordance with sfas no 
 segment reporting sfas 
we have identified three operating segments in accordance with sfas contract sales  lead development  and rainmaker asia 
the company s chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis  accompanied by detailed information listing revenues by customer  for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 
further  our operating segments have similar long term average gross margins 
accordingly  the company has concluded that we have one reportable segment 
however  in accordance with sfas  we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
thus  our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing are our operating segments of contract sales  lead development and rainmaker asia 
long lived assets long lived assets excluding goodwill including our purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
in the th quarter of as a result of the goodwill impairment testing discussed above  we had to evaluate our other long lived assets which included amortized intangible assets 
based on this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets exceeded their fair value based upon the estimated discounted cash flows related to the assets and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to intangible assets held at the lead development reporting unit  and approximately million related to intangible assets held at the rainmaker asia reporting unit 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
computer equipment and capitalized software are depreciated over two to five years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization of fixed assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense 

table of contents costs of internal use software are accounted for in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and emerging issue task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for website development costs 
sop and eitf require that we expense computer software and website development costs as they are incurred during the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of sop and eitf have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  including website development  the payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software and associated interest costs  are capitalized 
capitalized costs are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the term of related client agreement  if such development relates to a specific client  or the software s estimated useful life  ranging from two to five years 
capitalized internal use software and website development costs are included in property and equipment in the accompanying balance sheets 
during  we put in place a new customer relationship management system that included capitalized internal development costs 
in total  the system cost million and is being depreciated over five years on a straight line basis 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
at december  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in and  the deferred tax asset was subject to a valuation allowance and therefore is not recorded on our balance sheet as an asset 
realization of our deferred tax assets is limited and we may not be able to fully utilize these deferred tax assets to reduce our tax rates 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in any entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted fin effective january  and as a result of the adoption  the company recognized no adjustment to retained earnings and no change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 

table of contents sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations  other than option grants to employees and directors below the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
see note for further discussion of this statement and its effects on the financial statements presented herein 
foreign currency translation during january  we established a canadian foreign subsidiary and subsequently purchased the canadian based assets of cas systems 
additionally  in july  we purchased qinteraction limited and its philippine based subsidiary 
the functional currency of our canadian and philippine subsidiaries was determined to be their respective local currencies canadian dollar and philippine peso  in accordance with fas  foreign currency translation 
foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rates at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year 
the related unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant client concentrations in  hewlett packard accounted for more than of our net revenue and represented of our net revenue

in february  we received written notification from dell that they would be terminating our service agreement 
under dell s transition plan set forth in the notice  dell moved approximately half of the services provided by us under the agreement internally effective february   and moved the remainder over the subsequent three months 
we have not performed any services for dell subsequent to may  no individual client s end user customer accounted for or more of our net revenue in any period presented 
we have service agreements with our clients that expire at various dates ranging through december many of our client agreements contain automatic renewal clauses 
these clients may  however  terminate their contracts for cause in accordance with the provisions of each contract 
substantially all clients must provide us with advance written notice of their intention to terminate 
hewlett packard may terminate their contract with days notice 
any loss or reduction of business of a significant client would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
we expect that a substantial portion of our net revenue will continue to be concentrated among a few significant clients 
in addition  our technology clients operate in industries that are experiencing consolidation  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients

sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the increase is primarily due to approximately  in increased sales commission expenses   in increased personnel costs which include salaries benefits  severance  recruiting relocation due to employee turnover  and  in consulting fees for corporate marketing and other marketing initiatives 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as the company has reduced costs due to the challenging macroeconomic environment which has caused a slowdown in marketing spending by our customers 
technology and development expenses 
technology and development expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the increase is primarily attributable to increases in expenses relating to supporting client driven initiatives including an increase in project management staff and data resources

depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to the period 
the increase is primarily due to our acquisition of qinteraction in july which accounts for approximately million of

during  we changed the annual goodwill impairment evaluation date required under sfas  from january to october to better align this evaluation with our annual planning and budgeting process 
as of october   we started to perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas at that time  our initial indications determined that goodwill was impaired 
additionally in the th quarter of  we again assessed goodwill and long lived assets for impairment as we observed that there were indicators of impairment 
the notable indicators were our market capitalization declined significantly with the price of our stock  depressed market conditions  deteriorating industry trends  and a significant downward revision of our forecasts 
these market conditions continuously change and it is difficult to project how long this current economic downturn may last 
because of the decline in our market capitalization at december   we again tested for the potential impairment of goodwill as the decline in market capitalization was considered a triggering event under sfas  as well for amortizable intangible assets under sfas our goodwill and intangible assets were primarily established in purchase accounting at the completion of the sunset direct  view central  cas systems  and qinteraction acquisitions 
the projected discounted cash flows for our three reporting units contract sales  lead development  and rainmaker asia were based on discrete three year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts through were estimated based on both the reporting units respective historical performance and comparison to comparable public companies 
the annual sales growth rates ranged from negative to positive during the discrete forecast period 
these forecasts represent the best estimate that our management had at the time and believe to be reasonable 
the terminal value of our reporting units was determined using the gordon growth model  which applied a long term revenue growth rate of 
the terminal value represents the value of our reporting units at the end of the discrete forecast period 
the future cash flows and terminal value were discounted to present value using a discount rate range of 
the discount rate was based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of our reporting units 
prior to our goodwill impairment testing under sfas in the th quarter of  we also assessed the fair value of our long lived assets including our other finite lived amortizable intangible assets under sfas based on this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets exceeded their fair value based upon the estimated discounted cash flows related to the assets and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to intangible assets held at the lead development reporting unit  and approximately million related to intangible assets held at the rainmaker asia reporting unit 
based on this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of our amortizable intangible assets exceeded their fair value based upon the estimated discounted cash flows related to the assets and we recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to intangible assets held at the lead development reporting unit  and approximately million related to intangible assets held at the rainmaker asia reporting unit 
the fair value of our amortized intangible assets which included developed technology  customer relations  database and trade name was determined using discounted cash flow and excess earnings income approaches 
sfas provides for a two step approach to determining whether and by how much goodwill has been impaired 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value 
if the fair value is greater  then no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 
step of the impairment analysis 
table of contents determined that the carrying value of our lead development and rainmaker asia reporting units  subsequent to the impairment of our other finite lived amortizable intangible assets noted above  was greater than their fair value  and that the goodwill relating to these reporting units was impaired 
upon completion of step of the analysis  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million on the lead development reporting unit and approximately million on the rainmaker asia reporting unit  representing the entire balance of goodwill at these reporting units 
interest and other income expense  net 
the components of interest and other income expense  net are as follows in thousands year ended december  change interest income interest expense currency translation gain write down of strategic investment other interest income is attributable to the investing of our cash balances in short term interest bearing deposit accounts 
interest rate decreases and our declining cash balance during contributed to the change in interest income for the year 
interest expense is the result of the million term loan obtained in february in connection with the acquisition of sunset direct  interest on the million june term loan to fund the purchase and implementation of our new client management system  interest incurred with respect to notes payable issued with the purchase of the assets of cas systems and interest expense on the million borrowed under our revolving line of credit during the th quarter of we have paid off the term loan and the june term loan during and have made the first of three principal payments on the cas systems notes during the change in currency translation gain is primarily due to the fluctuation of currency exchange rates on a note payable to a third party denominated in united states dollars that is owed by our canadian subsidiary in connection with our acquisition of cas systems 
fluctuations of currency exchange rates may have a negative effect in future periods on our financial results 
the write down of strategic investment relates to our investment in a privately held company 
in october  we provided million in growth capital to this privately held company 
the transaction was structured as a million convertible loan and a million term loan secured by substantially all of the assets of the privately held company including intellectual property 
we also received a warrant as a part of this transaction to purchase approximately  shares of common stock of the privately held company 
in october  the convertible debt automatically converted to  shares of series a preferred stock of the privately held company 
because the private equity investment represents less than in the investee company  and because the company does not have any significant influence on the investee company  the investments are accounted for in accordance with the cost method described in apb  the equity method of accounting for common stock  and evaluated regularly for impairment indicators 
during the fourth quarter of  we assessed our investment for impairment as we observed that there were indicators of impairment 
the company is aware that the privately held company is operating at a loss  and while there is no quoted market prices available for the privately held company  as a marketing services company  it has likely been adversely affected by the recent economic downturn in a manner similar to rainmaker 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
table of contents between market participants at the measurement date an exit price 
sfas has also established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
level inputs apply to the determination of fair value for the company s private equity investment 
these are unobservable inputs where the determination of fair values of investments requires the application of significant judgment 
management s valuation methodologies include fundamental analysis that evaluates the investee company s progress in developing products  building intellectual property portfolios and securing customer relationships  as well as overall industry conditions  conditions in and prospects for the investee s geographic region  overall equity market conditions  and the level of financing already secured and available 
this is combined with analysis of comparable acquisition transactions and values to determine if the security s liquidation preferences will ensure full recovery of the company s investment in a likely acquisition outcome 
in its valuation analysis  management also considers the most recent transaction in a company s shares 
in the th quarter of  we took a charge in other expense of approximately  which represented a write off of the remaining carrying value of the warrant of  and a write down of the carrying value of the investment in series a preferred stock of the privately held company of  in order to write down these assets to their respective fair values 
it is possible that the factors evaluated by management and fair values will change in subsequent periods  resulting in material impairment charges in future periods

income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  even though we incurred a large loss in  we have not recorded any deferred tax benefits for such losses due to management s assessment that deferred tax assets are not more than likely to be realized in the future 
therefore  we recorded no deferred tax benefits for the losses 
in addition  certain of our current year losses are attributable to non tax deductible losses such as write of certain goodwill and intangibles in various jurisdictions  and thus do not create deferred tax benefits 
our income tax expense for the year ended december   primarily consists of estimates of foreign taxes  which include  but are not limited to  gross income taxes from one of our foreign subsidiaries  and certain state minimum and franchise taxes which is also determined largely based on gross income rather than net income

operating expenses operating expense as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal the increase can be attributed to the loss of the dell business which has resulted in less absorption of our fixed costs during additionally  
table of contents we have incurred significant increasing technology and development expenses relating to our investment in technology infrastructure  software development and tools in support of future growth  as well as an increase in expense related to supporting client driven initiatives including project management staff and data resources 
income loss from operations we were profitable in each quarter of our operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased in due primarily to increases in non cash costs for the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of cas systems in january of and qinteraction in july of  and lastly  in the fourth quarter of  an increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of additional equity awards to employees 
with the loss of the dell business beginning in the st quarter of  our loss from operations has increased sequentially during the last quarters of as we were not able to reduce operating expenses enough in to offset this significant loss in revenue 
we have made significant reductions in operating expenses in the rd and th quarters of that will have a favorable impact to operating results in additionally  in the th quarter of we incurred a non cash charge of approximately million related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on our lead development and rainmaker asia reporting units 
this is a non recurring charge and the result of this will be reduced amortization expense on amortizable intangibles in future periods 
liquidity and sources of capital we used million of cash in operating activities in  including million from operating activities  and million from changes in operating assets and liabilities mostly resulting from the termination of our agreement with our client  dell  which resulted in the unwinding of the timing difference in amounts we collected from dell s clients and the timing of when we had to pay dell 
in  we generated million in cash from operating activities and in we generated million in cash from operating activities 
we used cash in operating activities in substantially all years prior to and we funded our operations from cash proceeds from the sale of common stock and the incurrence of debt 
from through  we raised aggregate net proceeds of million from private placements of common stock  and during we raised net proceeds of million from a follow on offering of common stock 
during  we raised an aggregate of million from term loans from institutional lenders to fund our operations and support our acquisitions of other businesses

the two largest components of our changes in operating assets and liabilities are accounts payable and accounts receivable 
when we sell a service or maintenance contract for a client  we record the sales price of the contract to the client s customer as our receivable and also record our payable to the client for our cost of the contract  which is effectively the same amount less our compensation for obtaining the contract for our client 
for this reason  our accounts payable includes amounts due to our clients for service and maintenance contracts we sold on their behalf 
accounts payable therefore increases in relation to our increased sales of service contracts on behalf of our clients 
however  because we report as revenue only the net difference between our account receivable from the customer of our client and our account payable to our client in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  any increase in net revenue 
table of contents from service contract sales results in a much larger increase in our accounts payable  which is treated as positive cash flow from operating activities 
the reduction in accounts receivable and payable in are a direct impact of the termination of the dell services agreement 
accounts receivable decreased at december  as compared to december  as a result of lower overall sales at the end of as compared to the end of our days sales outstanding  or dso  increased to days at december  as compared to days at december  since we record the gross billing to the end customer of our contract sales clients in our accounts receivable  we calculate dso based on our ability to collect those gross billings from the end customers 
we record revenue based on the net commission we retain 
cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of net income totaling million  non cash expenditures of depreciation and amortization of property and intangibles of million  stock based compensation charges of million  the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts of  and changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  that used million 
cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our acquisition of cas systems in january for which we used cash of approximately million and qinteraction limited in july for which we used cash of approximately million 
this compares to the million that we invested in cas systems in as a result of the achievement of certain financial milestones as specified in the purchase agreement 
investments in property and equipment were million in as compared to million in in  we invested million in the purchase of notes receivable and warrants from marketlead 
restricted cash represents the reserve for the refund due for non service payments inadvertently paid to the company by its customers instead of paid directly to the company s clients 
at the time of cash receipt the company records a current liability for the amount of non service payments received 
the change in restricted cash represents the increase of our balance of refunds due to customers 
cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily the result of borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
these borrowings were partially offset by principal payments of notes payable of million  purchases of treasury stock of  principal payments of capital lease obligations of  and tax payments made by the company in connection with treasury stock surrendered related to stock based compensation vestings 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily a result of the net proceeds of million received from the follow on offering of common stock in april we also received approximately million from the exercise of stock options  warrants and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
these amounts were partially offset by principal payments of million on our term loans and purchases of  of treasury stock from employees and directors for shares withheld for income taxes payable on restricted stock awards vested 
in connection with our acquisitions of cas systems in january and qinteraction limited in july  the purchase agreements provide for a potential additional payment at the end of twelve months following each acquisition  based on the achievement of certain financial milestones specific to each individual acquisition 
in the first quarter of the fiscal year  the company paid million relating to the cas systems acquisition 
the company has determined that no additional payment is due for the qinteraction limited acquisition as the financial milestones specified in this acquisition agreement were not met 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million available under our revolving line of credit 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain our current level of operations  our planned operations and our planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we are anticipating capital expenditures of approximately million to million for the fiscal year

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we currently do not and do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in low risk securities 
to minimize our risks  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of short term and liquid securities including money market funds  commercial paper  us government and agency securities and municipal bonds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our portfolio was invested in instruments that mature in less than days 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio at december   we do not believe we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
however  based upon the balance in our money market account at december  of approximately million  a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an approximate annual impact of  on our income before income taxes 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of the revolving credit facility  which bears interest at variable rates based on the prime lending rate at december  
at december   we had approximately million outstanding under the equipment sub facility of the revolving credit facility 
the interest rate per annum for advances under the equipment finance sub facility is equal to the prime rate plus  subject to a minimum interest rate of 
based on the outstanding principal balance at the end of  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would not result in any additional annual interest expense due to the minimum interest rate of the equipment sub facility that is currently in place 
based on our debt level at december   anticipated cash flows from operations  and the various financial alternatives available to management  should there be an adverse change in interest rates  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations 
foreign currency risk prior to  our business has typically been transacted in the us dollar and  as such  has not been subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  with our acquisitions of operations in canada and the philippines during  we now have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
to the extent that the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses 
conversely  our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
during the years ended december  and  international revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
the majority of the international revenue was generated in the cayman islands and is us dollar based 
we are expanding our services to address our clients international operations and expect to conduct transactions on behalf of our clients in a number of geographies and currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we recorded net foreign currency transaction gains of approximately  and  respectively  which is recorded in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we may enter into hedges in the future to manage foreign currency risk  however  we did not have any currency hedges in place as of december
