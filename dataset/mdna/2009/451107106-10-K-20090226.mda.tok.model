utility operations ipc was incorporated under the laws of the state of idaho in as successor to a maine corporation organized in ipc s service territory covers approximately  square miles in southern idaho and eastern oregon  with an estimated population of approximately one million 
ipc holds franchises in cities in idaho and nine cities in oregon and holds certificates from the respective public utility regulatory authorities to serve all or a portion of counties in idaho and three counties in oregon 
as of december   ipc supplied electric energy to approximately  general business customers 
ipc is one of the nation s few investor owned utilities with a predominantly hydroelectric generating base 
ipc owns and operates hydroelectric generation developments  two natural gas fired plants and one diesel powered generator and shares ownership in three coal fired generating plants 
these generating plants and their capacities are listed in item properties 
ipc s coal fired plants are in wyoming  oregon and nevada  and use low sulfur coal from wyoming and utah 
the primary influences on electricity sales are weather  customer growth and economic conditions 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
increased precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season reduce electricity sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
variations in weather  customer growth and economic conditions also impact power supply costs 
drought conditions and customer growth cause a greater reliance on more expensive thermal generation and purchased power to meet load requirements 
favorable hydroelectric generation conditions increase production at ipc s hydroelectric generating facilities  and reduce the need for more expensive thermal generation and purchased power 
changes in economic conditions can also affect the price of commodities  including fuel costs  which may impact power supply costs 
ipc s principal commercial and industrial customers are involved in food processing  electronics and general manufacturing  forest products  beet sugar refining and winter recreation 
on january   the idaho public utilities commission ipuc granted authority to temporarily amend ipc s electric service agreement with one of its largest customers for the period january   through june   to provide the customer flexibility in restructuring its operations 
this amendment is not expected to have a significant impact on ipc s earnings 
on september   ipc entered into an electric service agreement with a new customer  hoku materials  inc hoku  to provide electric service to hoku s polysilicon production facility under construction in pocatello  idaho 
the initial term of the agreement is four years beginning june   with automatic annual renewal after june  unless either party gives months prior written notice of termination 
the agreement provides for a maximum demand obligation during the initial term of megawatts mw 
after june   hoku may increase or decrease its total demand to between mw and mw 
the agreement was submitted to the ipuc for approval in october regulation ipc is under the regulatory jurisdiction as to rates  service  accounting and other general matters of utility operation of the ferc  the ipuc and the oregon public utility commission opuc 
ipc is also under the regulatory jurisdiction of the ipuc  the opuc and the public service commission of wyoming as to the issuance of debt and equity securities 
ipc s retail rates are established under the jurisdiction of the state regulatory commissions see rates below 
pursuant to the requirements of section of purpa  the state regulatory commissions have each issued orders and rules regulating ipc s purchase of power from cogeneration and small power production cspp facilities 
ipc is subject to the provisions of the federal power act as a public utility and as a licensee as therein defined and is subject to regulation by the ferc 
the energy policy act of energy act granted the ferc increased statutory authority to implement mandatory transmission and reliability standards  as well as enhanced oversight of power and transmission markets  including protection against market manipulation 
as a licensee under part i of the fpa  ipc and its licensed hydroelectric projects are subject to conditions set forth in the fpa and related ferc regulations 
these conditions and regulations include provisions relating to condemnation of a project upon payment of just compensation  amortization of project investment from excess project earnings  possible takeover of a project after expiration of its license upon payment of net investment  severance damages and other matters 
as a public utility under part ii of the fpa  ipc has authority to charge market based rates for wholesale energy sales under its ferc tariff and to provide transmission services under its open access transmission tariff oatt 
the state of oregon has a hydroelectric act providing for licensing of hydroelectric projects in that state 
ipc s brownlee  oxbow and hells canyon facilities are on the snake river where it forms the boundary between idaho and oregon and occupy lands in both states 
with respect to project property located in oregon  these facilities are subject to the oregon hydroelectric act 
ipc has obtained oregon licenses for these facilities and these licenses are not in conflict with the fpa or ipc s ferc licenses see part ii  item md a regulatory matters relicensing of hydroelectric projects 
rates the rates ipc charges to its general business customers are determined by the ipuc and the opuc 
approximately percent of ipc s general business revenue comes from customers in idaho 
ipc has a power cost adjustment pca mechanism that provides for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho retail customers 
the pca tracks ipc s actual net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less off system sales and compares these amounts to net power supply costs currently being recovered in retail rates 
prior to february   approximately percent of the difference between the actual and forecasted costs was deferred with interest 
beginning on february   this percentage was increased to percent 
ipc also has a power cost recovery mechanism in oregon with two components that became effective june  the annual power cost update apcu allows ipc to recover excess net power supply costs in a more timely fashion than through the previous deferral process because it reestablishes base net power supply costs annually 
the power cost adjustment mechanism pcam provides for percent customer sharing of deviations in actual net power supply costs from those included in the apcu if the deviations are outside of prescribed ranges and ipc meets a return on equity test 
the rates ipc charges to its transmission customers are determined by the ferc 
ipc s oatt is a formula rate  which allows for transmission rates to be revised each year based on financial and operational data ipc is required to file annually with the ferc in its form significant rate cases and proceedings are discussed in more detail in part ii  item md a regulatory matters 
power supply ipc meets its system load requirements using a combination of its own generation  mandated purchases from private developers see cspp purchases below and purchases from other utilities and power wholesalers 
ipc s generating plants and capacities are listed in item properties 
ipc s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
the all time system peak demand is  mw  set on june  the previous hourly system peak of  mw was set july  the all time winter peak demand is  mw set on january  the previous hourly system winter peak of  mw was set in including the expected impact of the hoku electric service agreement  ipc expects total system average load to grow percent annually over the next three years 
because of its reliance on hydroelectric generation  ipc s generation operations can be significantly affected by water conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of ipc s hydroelectric facilities  reservoir storage  springtime snow pack run off  river base flows  spring flows  rainfall and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
during low water years  when stream flows into ipc s hydroelectric projects are reduced  ipc s hydroelectric generation is reduced 
this results in less generation from ipc s resource portfolio hydroelectric  coal fired and gas fired available for off system sales and  most likely  an increased use of purchased power to meet load requirements 
both of these situations a reduction in off system sales and an increased use of more expensive purchased power result in increased power supply costs 
the following table presents ipc s system generation for the last three years mwh percent of total generation thousands of mwhs hydroelectric thermal total system generation under normal stream flow conditions  ipc s system generation mix is approximately percent hydroelectric and percent thermal 
stream flow conditions improved slightly in resulting in an increase of million mwh generated from ipc s hydroelectric facilities as compared to the observed stream flow data released in august by the us army corps of engineers  northwest division indicated that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf  or percent of the national weather service northwest river forecast center nwrfc average  compared to maf  or percent of the nwrfc average  in storage in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee as of february   was percent of average 
the stream flow forecast released on february   by the nwrfc predicts that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july will be maf  or percent of the nwrfc average 
ipc s generating facilities are interconnected through its integrated transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to achieve maximum load carrying capability and reliability 
ipc s transmission system is directly interconnected with the transmission systems of the bonneville power administration bpa  avista corporation  pacificorp  northwestern energy and nv energy formerly sierra pacific power company 
such interconnections  coupled with transmission line capacity made available under agreements with some of the above entities  permit the interchange  purchase and sale of power among all major electric systems in the west 
ipc is a member of the western electricity coordinating council  the western systems power pool  the northwest power pool  the northern tier transmission group  and the north american energy standards board 
these groups have been formed to more efficiently coordinate transmission reliability and planning throughout the western grid

fuel ipc  through its subsidiary ierco  owns a one third interest in bridger coal  which owns the jim bridger mine that supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant one third owned by ipc in wyoming 
the mine  located near the jim bridger plant  operates under a long term sales agreement that provides for delivery of coal over a year period ending in from surface  high wall  and underground sources 
the jim bridger mine has sufficient reserves to provide coal deliveries for the term of the sales agreement 
ipc also has a coal supply contract providing for annual deliveries of coal through from the black butte coal company s black butte and leucite hills mines located near the jim bridger plant 
this contract supplements the bridger coal deliveries and provides another coal supply to operate the jim bridger plant 
the jim bridger plant s rail load in facility and unit coal train allow the plant to take advantage of potentially lower cost coal from other mines for tonnage requirements above established contract minimums 
the bridger coal mine experienced difficulties in meeting its production volume and operating cost goals during early the problems stemmed from soft floor and roof stability issues that began in late december in the underground longwall mining operation longwall 
the impact on december production was relatively minor  however the problems persisted and january production volume was approximately percent of forecast 
bridger coal s overall production and cost objectives were achieved by modifying the surface mine operation plan to offset the underground mining difficulties and by purchasing additional black butte coal 
as of year end  the longwall was operating at normal production levels 
ipc anticipates that budgeted production from both the underground and surface operations will be achieved in nv energy  as operator of the north valmy generating plant  has an agreement with arch coal sales company  inc to supply coal to the plant through as a percent owner of the plant  ipc is obligated to purchase one half of the coal  ranging from  tons to  tons annually 
nv energy also has a coal supply contract with black butte coal company s black butte mine for deliveries through ipc is obligated to purchase one half of the coal purchased under this agreement  ranging from  to  tons annually 
the boardman generating plant receives coal from the powder river basin through annual contracts 
portland general electric  as operator of the boardman plant  had an agreement with buckskin mining company to supply all of boardman s coal requirements through and has entered into a contract with foundation energy sales  inc to supply coal from through as a ten percent owner of the plant  ipc is obligated to purchase ten percent of the coal purchased under these agreements  which ranged from  to  tons annually under the buckskin agreement and ranges from  to  tons annually under the foundation energy sales contract 
the boardman partners are in the process of securing contracts for additional coal tonnage that will be needed in and ipc owns and operates the danskin and bennett mountain combustion turbines  which are supplied gas through northwest pipeline gp s pipeline 
gas is purchased as needs are identified for summer peaks or to meet system requirements 
the gas is transported under a long term agreement with northwest pipeline gp for  million british thermal units mmbtu per day 
this agreement runs through february   with annual extensions at ipc s sole discretion 
ipc also has the ability to flow a total of  mmbtu on an alternate firm basis without incurring a reservation charge on the additional amount 
ipc also has entered into an agreement with northwest pipeline gp for  mmbtu per day of gas transport 
gas transmission will begin november  and run through november  in addition to this agreement  ipc has entered into a long term agreement with northwest pipeline gp for  mmbtu of total storage capacity at the jackson prairie storage project located in lewis county  washington 
as the project is developed  storage capacity will be phased into service and allocated to ipc on a monthly basis 
ipc s current storage allotment is approximately percent of its total  and its full allotment is expected to be reached by january the firm storage contract extends through november   with bilateral termination rights at the end of the contract 
storage gas will be purchased and stored with the intent of fulfilling needs as identified for summer peaks or to meet system requirements 
water rights except as discussed below  ipc has acquired water rights under applicable state law for all waters used in its hydroelectric generating facilities 
in addition  ipc holds water rights for domestic  irrigation  commercial and other necessary purposes related to other land and facility holdings within the state 
the exercise and use of all of these water rights are subject to prior rights  and with respect to certain hydroelectric generating facilities  ipc s water rights for power generation are subordinated to certain future upstream diversions of water for irrigation and other recognized consumptive uses 
over time  increased irrigation development and other consumptive diversions have resulted in a reduction in the stream flows available to fulfill ipc s water rights at certain hydroelectric generating facilities 
in reaction to these reductions  ipc initiated and continues to pursue a course of action to determine and protect its water rights 
as part of this process  ipc and the state of idaho signed the swan falls agreement on october   which provided a level of protection for ipc s hydropower water rights at specified plants by setting minimum stream flows and establishing an administrative process governing the future development of water rights that may affect ipc s hydroelectric generation 
in  congress passed  and the president signed into law  house bill this legislation permitted implementation of the swan falls agreement and further provided that during the remaining term of certain of ipc s project licenses the relationship established by the agreement would not be considered by the ferc as being inconsistent with the terms of ipc s project licenses or imprudent for the purposes of determining rates under section of the fpa 
the ferc entered an order implementing the legislation on march  in addition to providing for the protection of ipc s hydroelectric water rights  the swan falls agreement contemplated the initiation of a general adjudication of all water uses within the snake river basin 
in  the director of the idaho department of water resources filed a petition in state district court asking that the court adjudicate all claims to water rights  whether based on state or federal law  within the snake river basin 
the court signed a commencement order initiating the snake river basin adjudication srba on november  this legal proceeding was authorized by state statute based upon a determination by the idaho legislature that the effective management of the waters of the snake river basin required a comprehensive determination of the nature  extent and priority of all water uses within the basin 
the adjudication is proceeding and is expected to continue for at least the next several years 
ipc has filed claims to its water rights within the basin and is actively participating in the adjudication in an effort to ensure that its water rights and the operation of its hydroelectric facilities are not adversely impacted 
in certain instances  the adjudication of water rights in the srba results in the initiation of litigation  called subcases  to determine the scope and nature of a particular water right 
ipc is involved in subcases involving not only its water rights but also the water rights of other claimants 
one such subcase involves ipc s water rights at the swan falls project on the snake river and several other upstream hydroelectric projects that are the subject of the swan falls agreement 
ipc also has initiated legal action against the us bureau of reclamation usbr over the interpretation and effect of a contract with the usbr on the operation of the american falls reservoir and the release of water from that reservoir to be used at ipc s downstream hydroelectric projects

integrated resource plan irp ipc filed its integrated resource plan irp with the ipuc in september and with the opuc in october the irp previewed ipc s load and resource situation for the next twenty years  analyzed potential supply side and demand side options and identified near term and long term actions 
the two primary goals of the irp were to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for electric service within ipc s service area throughout the year planning period and ensure that the portfolio of resources selected balances cost  risk and environmental concerns 
the ipuc accepted the irp in march and the opuc acknowledged the irp in september with its acceptance of the irp  the ipuc requested that ipc align the submittal of its next irp with those submitted by other idaho utilities 
to comply with this request  ipc provided an update on the status of the irp to both the ipuc and opuc in june an irp addendum was also filed with the opuc in february to address the need for the boardman to hemingway transmission project 
ipc is currently preparing the irp  which is scheduled to be completed in june please see further discussion in part ii item md a regulatory matters integrated resource plan 
cspp purchases as mandated by purpa and the adoption of avoided cost rates by the ipuc and the opuc  ipc has entered into contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
under these contracts  ipc is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside its service territory 
for projects located outside its service territory  ipc is required to purchase the output that it has the ability to receive at the facility s requested point of delivery on the ipc system 
the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts are fully recovered through base rates and the pca 
for ipuc jurisdictional contracts  projects that generate up to ten average mw of energy monthly are eligible for ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the opuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts is recovered through general rate case filings 
for opuc jurisdictional contracts  projects with a nameplate rating of up to ten mw of capacity are eligible for opuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and opuc to estimate ipc s cost of developing additional generation resources 
if a purpa project does not qualify for published avoided costs  then ipc is required to negotiate the terms  prices and conditions with the developer of that project 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location and size and the benefits to the ipc system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
during  at the ipuc s direction  ipc conducted workshops to review the published avoided cost model input components 
a settlement stipulation was filed with the ipuc for its consideration that  if accepted  will result in an increase in the non fuel component of the published avoided costs 
as of december   ipc had signed agreements to purchase energy from cspp facilities with contracts ranging from one to years 
seventy nine of these facilities  with a combined nameplate capacity of mw  were on line at the end of  the other facilities under contract  with a combined nameplate capacity of mw  are projected to come on line during and the majority of the new facilities will be wind resources which will generate on an intermittent basis 
during  ipc purchased  megawatt hours mwh from these projects at a cost of million  resulting in a blended price of cents per kilowatt hour 
wholesale energy market activities guided by a risk management policy and frequently updated operating plans  ipc participates in the wholesale energy market by buying power to help meet load demands and selling power that is in excess of load demands 
ipc s market activities are influenced by its customer loads  market prices  and cost and availability of generating resources 
some of ipc s hydroelectric generation facilities are operated to optimize the water that is available by choosing when to run generation units and when to store water in reservoirs 
these decisions affect the timing and volumes of market purchases and market sales 
even in below normal water years  there are opportunities to vary water usage to maximize generation unit efficiency  capture marketplace economic benefits and meet load demand 
compliance factors  such as allowable river stage elevation changes and flood control requirements  and wholesale energy market prices influence these dispatch decisions 
ipc has one firm wholesale power sales contract 
the sales contract is with the raft river electric cooperative for up to mw 
this contract expires in september  however  raft river electric cooperative has provided notice that it intends to renew the contract  as allowed in the original agreement  through september ipc has one wholesale reserve sales contract  with united materials of great falls  inc united materials 
this agreement requires ipc to carry up to mw of reserves associated with an energy sales agreement dated january between ipc and united materials from the horseshoe bend wind farm 
the term of this agreement began in january  and runs seasonally through may ipc has four firm wholesale purchased power contracts 
one contract is with ppl montana  llc  now known as ppl energyplus  llc  for mw per hour during heavy load hours  to address increased demand during june  july and august 
the term of this contract began in june and runs through august ipc entered into a second seasonal contract for mw with ppl energyplus  llc that runs from june through august in january  the ipuc approved a power purchase agreement for mw nameplate generation from the raft river geothermal power plant unit located in southern idaho that converted a cspp contract to a purchased power contract 
the contract term is through april the fourth contract is with telocaset wind power partners  llc  a subsidiary of horizon wind energy  for mw nameplate generation from its elkhorn valley wind project located in eastern oregon 
the contract term is through december transmission services ipc provides wholesale transmission service and provides firm and non firm wheeling services for eligible transmission customers 
ipc s system lies between and is interconnected with the winter peaking northern and summer peaking southern regions of the western power system 
this geographic position allows ipc to provide transmission services and to reach a broad power market 
ipc and pacificorp are jointly exploring the gateway west project to build transmission lines between windstar  a substation located near douglas  wyoming and hemingway  a substation located in the vicinity of melba and murphy  idaho near boise 
initial phases of the project could be completed by remaining phases of the project could be constructed as demand requires 
construction of a new kv station named hemingway is expected to address growth  capacity and operating constraints 
the station was originally part of the gateway west project but the timing of this addition was accelerated to to help meet forecast deficits and improve reliability 
as part of the hemingway station project  the hemingway hubbard transmission line is expected to provide power to the treasure valley area of southwest idaho by the hemingway hubbard line will consist of a new kv double circuit transmission line and convert an existing kv transmission line to kv 
the boardman hemingway transmission line is expected to relieve existing congestion by increasing transmission capacity and improving reliability 
it will allow for the transfer of up to  mw of additional energy between idaho and the northwest 
ipc expects to seek partners for up to percent of the project when construction commences 
the line has a target in service date of june these projects are discussed in more detail in part ii item md a liquidity and capital resources capital requirements and md a regulatory matters transmission projects 
on march   great basin transmission  llc great basin exercised its option to purchase the southern portion of the southwest intertie project swip  which consists principally of a federal permit for a specific transmission corridor in nevada and idaho and private rights of way in idaho 
this sale closed during the second quarter of  and resulted in a net pre tax gain of approximately million 
on december   ipc and great basin reached an agreement on the sale of the northern portion of the swip  which is expected to close in the first quarter of and result in a pre tax gain of million 
environmental regulation ipc s activities are subject to a broad range of federal  state  regional and local laws and regulations designed to protect  restore and enhance the quality of the environment 
environmental regulation continues to impact ipc s operations due to the cost of installation and operation of equipment and facilities required for compliance with such regulations  and the modification of system operations to accommodate such regulations 
ipc s environmental compliance costs will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future 
based upon present environmental laws and regulations  ipc estimates its capital expenditures for environmental matters  excluding allowance for funds used during construction afudc  will total million 
studies and measures related to environmental concerns at ipc s hydroelectric facilities account for million and investments in environmental equipment and facilities at the thermal plants account for million 
for and  environmental related capital expenditures  excluding afudc  are estimated to be million 
anticipated expenses related to ipc s hydroelectric facilities account for million  and thermal plant expenses are expected to total million 
ipc anticipates approximately million in annual operating costs for environmental facilities during hydroelectric facility expenses and thermal plant expenses account for the majority of the costs at approximately million and million  respectively 
for and  total environmental related operating costs are estimated to be approximately million 
expenses related to the hydroelectric facilities are expected to be million  and thermal plant expenses are expected to be million during this period 
water as required under the federal water pollution control act amendments of  ipc has received necessary environmental permits and authorizations and has prepared necessary plans relating to operations and water quality  such as effluent discharge  spill prevention and countermeasures  and storm water pollution prevention 
the ferc licenses issued for ipc s american falls and cascade hydroelectric generating plants require aeration of turbine water to meet dissolved oxygen standards in the tail waters downstream from the plants 
in order to comply with the licenses  ipc installed and operates aeration equipment at both plants and submits compliance reports to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
the ferc licenses issued for ipc s milner  shoshone falls  twin falls  upper salmon  lower salmon  bliss and cj strike hydroelectric projects require dissolved oxygen and temperature monitoring and reporting 
ipc submits compliance reports to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
the ferc license for the cj strike project also requires monitoring of total dissolved gas during spill periods 
ipc installs monitors during periods of spill that record gas levels in spilled water and reports the results to the appropriate regulatory agencies 
hazardous toxic wastes and substances under the toxic substances control act  the epa has adopted regulations governing the use  storage  inspection and disposal of electrical equipment that contains polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 
the regulations permit the continued use and servicing of certain equipment including transformers and capacitors that contain pcbs 
ipc continues to meet federal requirements of the toxic substances control act for the continued use of equipment containing pcbs 
ipc continues to eliminate pcbs as part of its long term strategy 
this program will reduce costs associated with the long term monitoring of pcb containing equipment  responding to spills and reporting to the epa

energy efficiency programs in  ipc spent approximately million to promote energy efficiency and summer peak reduction through its energy efficiency programs  which have previously been referred to as demand side management programs 
approximately million of funding for program development  implementation and administration comes from the idaho and oregon tariff riders for energy efficiency 
the balance of the funding comes from ipc base rates and a small amount was previously obtained from residual funds from the bpa s conservation and renewables discount which was discontinued in approximately million was spent on research  analysis and development  education  technology evaluation  and market transformation 
a portion of this activity was accomplished in conjunction with the northwest energy efficiency alliance neea 
ipc contributed million to the neea 
the following energy efficiency programs target savings across the entire year for a wide range of customer segments with an emphasis on reducing energy during the summer peak approximately million was devoted to achieving summer peak reduction through focusing on irrigation pumping and residential air conditioning equipment control measures 
the residential energy efficiency programs targeted new and existing homes  focusing on customer education and the application of energy efficiency remediation  including energy efficient building techniques  insulation augmentation  air duct sealing  and the use of efficient lighting 
this program s spending was approximately million 
programs for new or existing industrial and commercial facilities focus on application of energy efficient techniques and technologies as well as operational and management processes to reduce energy consumption 
approximately million was spent on these programs 
approximately million was devoted to irrigation efficiency programs 
irrigation customers can receive financial incentives for either improving the energy efficiency of an irrigation system or installing a new energy efficiency system 
in  ipc s energy efficiency programs reduced energy usage by approximately  mwh and the targeted demand reduction programs resulted in a summer peak reduction of about mw 
competition retail electric utilities have historically been recognized as natural monopolies and have operated in a highly regulated environment in which they have an obligation to provide electric service to their customers in return for an exclusive franchise within their service territory with an opportunity to earn a regulated rate of return 
in the past  some state regulatory authorities explored changing utility regulations in response to federal and state statutory changes  with the intent of increasing retail competition 
however  restructuring of the electric industry has stalled at both the national level and in the pacific northwest 
wholesale the national energy policy act and the ferc s rulemaking activities have established the regulatory framework to open the wholesale energy market to competition 
this act permits entities to develop independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers  and authorizes the ferc to order transmission access for third parties to transmission facilities owned by another entity 
this act does not  however  permit the ferc to require transmission access to retail customers 
open access transmission for wholesale customers provides energy suppliers with opportunities to sell and deliver electricity at market based prices 
ipc actively monitors and participates  as appropriate  in energy industry developments  to maintain and enhance its ability to effectively participate in wholesale energy markets in a manner consistent with its business goals

ida west ida west operates and has a percent interest in nine hydroelectric plants with a total generating capacity of mw 
four of the projects are located in idaho and five are in northern california 
all nine projects are qualifying facilities under purpa 
ipc purchased all of the power generated by ida west s four idaho hydroelectric projects at a cost of million each year in  and item a 
risk factors the following are factors that could have a significant impact on the operations and financial results of idacorp  inc and idaho power company and could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements reduced hydroelectric generation can reduce revenues and increase costs 
idaho power company has a predominately hydroelectric generating base 
because of idaho power company s heavy reliance on hydroelectric generation  water can significantly affect its operations 
when hydroelectric generation is reduced  idaho power company must increase its use of generally more expensive thermal generating resources and purchased power and opportunities for off system sales are reduced  which reduces revenues 
in addition  while idaho power company can expect to recover a portion of the increase in its net power supply costs above the level included in its base rates  recovery of the amounts does not occur until the subsequent power cost adjustment year 
continuing declines in stream flows and over appropriation of water in idaho may reduce hydroelectric generation and revenues and increase costs 
the combination of declining snake river base flows  over appropriation of water and drought conditions have led to disputes among surface water and ground water irrigators  and the state of idaho 
recharging the eastern snake plain aquifer  which contributes to snake river flows  by diverting surface water to porous locations and permitting it to sink into the aquifer is one proposed solution to the dispute 
diversions from the snake river for aquifer recharge may further reduce snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation and reduce idaho power company s revenues and increase costs 
idaho power company is also involved in legal actions involving the water rights it holds for hydroelectric purposes 
one such action  initiated in the snake river basin adjudication  involves idaho power company s water rights at the swan falls project on the snake river and several other upstream hydroelectric projects that are the subject of a agreement with the state of idaho known as the swan falls agreement 
idaho power company also has initiated legal action against the us bureau of reclamation over the interpretation and effect of a contract with the us bureau of reclamation on the operation of the american falls reservoir and the release of water from that reservoir to be used at idaho power company s downstream hydroelectric projects 
the resolution of these matters may affect snake river flows available for hydroelectric generation and thereby reduce idaho power company revenues and increase costs 
load growth in idaho power company s service territory exposes it to greater market and operational risk and could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
o increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy have resulted and may continue to result in increased reliance on purchased power to meet customer load requirements 
since the federal energy regulatory commission implemented market based wholesale power rates in  the price volatility of electricity has substantially increased from what it was at the inception of the power cost adjustment 
while idaho power company can expect to recover a portion of the increase in its net power supply costs above the level included in its base rates  the remaining amount is absorbed by idaho power company 
as idaho power company s reliance on purchased power continues to increase  the risks associated with the remaining amount not recovered through the power cost adjustment could increase costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
o idaho power company s load growth adjustment rate adjusts the net power supply costs idaho power company includes in its annual power cost adjustment for differences between actual load and the load used in calculating base rates 
if the idaho public utilities commission increases the rate or modifies the method used to calculate the load growth adjustment rate idaho power company s earnings and cash flows could be reduced 
o increased load growth can result in the need for additional investments in idaho power company s infrastructure to serve the new load 
if idaho power company were unable to secure timely rate relief from the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission or the federal energy regulatory commission to recover the costs of these additional investments  the resulting regulatory lag would have a negative effect on earnings and cash flow 
o increased and unexpected load growth can create planning and operating difficulties for idaho power company that can impact its ability to reliably serve customers 
idaho power company s reliance on coal and natural gas to fuel its power generation facilities exposes it to risk of increased costs and reduced earnings 
in addition to hydroelectric generation  idaho power company relies on coal and natural gas to fuel its generation facilities 
market price increases in coal and natural gas can result in reduced earnings 
increases in demand for natural gas  including increases in demand due to greater industry reliance on natural gas for power generation  may result in market price increases and or supply availability issues 
in addition  delivery of coal and natural gas depends upon gas pipelines  rail lines  rail cars and roadways 
any disruption in idaho power company s fuel supply may require the company to find alternative fuel sources at higher costs  to produce power from higher cost generation facilities or to purchase power from other sources at higher costs 
changes in temperature and precipitation can reduce power sales and revenues 
warmer than normal winters  cooler than normal summers and increased rainfall during the irrigation seasons will reduce retail revenues from power sales 
climate change could affect customer demand and hydroelectric generation and disrupt transmission and distribution systems  reducing earnings and cash flows 
changes in temperature  precipitation and snow pack conditions will affect customer demand and the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation 
extreme weather events can disrupt transmission and distribution systems  and cause service interruptions and extended outages 
decreased customer demand and hydroelectric generation and increased operations and maintenance costs from disrupted transmission and distribution systems will reduce earnings and cash flows 
the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will increase capital expenditures and operating costs and may reduce idaho power company s earnings and cash flows and ability to meet the electricity needs of its customers 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  natural resources and health and safety 
compliance with these environmental statutes  rules and regulations involves significant capital and operating expenditures 
these expenditures could become even more significant in the future if legislation  regulations and enforcement policies change 
for instance  considerable attention has been focused on emissions from coal fired generating plants  including carbon dioxide  and their potential role in contributing to global warming 
proposals by congress and the environmental protection agency could lead to the adoption of a mandatory federal program to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
such a program would raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  specifically coal  as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because technologies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal  including carbon capture and storage  are not yet proven 
the effects of mercury and other pollutant emissions from coal fired plants are also subject to extensive regulation 
the adoption of new statutes  rules and regulations to implement carbon dioxide  mercury or other emission controls will result in increased capital expenditures and could increase the cost of operating coal fired generating plants or make them uneconomical to operate and result in reduced earnings and cash flows the costs of complying with state or federal renewable energy portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company s operations in oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable energy portfolio standard beginning in the new federal administration has called on congress to adopt a federal renewable energy portfolio standard and it is possible that idaho and other states in which idaho power company operates or sells power could adopt renewable energy portfolio standards in the future 
new state or federal renewable energy portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
if the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission or the federal energy regulatory commission grant less rate recovery in rate case filings than idaho power company needs to cover increased costs of providing services  earnings and cash flows may be reduced and economic expansion may be limited 
if the idaho public utilities commission  the oregon public utility commission or the federal energy regulatory commission grant less rate recovery in rate case filings than idaho power company needs to cover increased costs of providing services  it may have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows and could result in downgrades of idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings 
failure to obtain regular and timely rate relief may limit idaho power company s ability to serve additional customers 
conditions that may be imposed in connection with hydroelectric license renewals may require large capital expenditures  increase operating costs  reduce hydroelectric production and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idaho power company is currently involved in renewing federal licenses for several of its hydroelectric projects 
the federal energy regulatory commission may impose conditions with respect to environmental  operating and other matters in connection with the renewal of idaho power company s licenses 
these conditions could have a negative effect on idaho power company s operations  require large capital expenditures and increase operating costs  reduce hydroelectric production and reduce earnings and cash flows 
idacorp  inc  idacorp energy and idaho power company are subject to costs and other effects of legal and regulatory proceedings  settlements  investigations and claims 
idacorp  inc  idacorp energy and idaho power company are involved in a number of proceedings  including the california refund proceeding  a portion of which remains pending before the federal energy regulatory commission and the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit  a refund proceeding affecting sellers of wholesale power in the spot market in the pacific northwest  and show cause proceedings originating at the federal energy regulatory commission  a portion of which remains pending in the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
it is possible that additional proceedings related to the western energy situation may be filed in the future against idacorp  inc  idacorp energy or idaho power company 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are or may also be subject to costs and other effects of additional legal claims  actions and complaints  including those related to the jim bridger and boardman coal fired plants  in which idaho power company holds an ownership interest 
to the extent the companies are required to make payments in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding  settlement  investigation or claim  earnings and cash flows will be negatively affected 
idaho power company s business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by increased costs resulting from  or liability under  existing or future regulations or requirements 
idaho power company is subject to extensive federal and state laws  policies  and regulations  as well as regulatory actions and regulatory audits  including those of the federal energy regulatory commission  the environmental protection agency  the north american electric reliability corporation  the western electricity coordinating council and the public utility commissions in idaho  oregon and wyoming 
some of these regulations are changing or subject to interpretation  and failure to comply may result in penalties or other adverse consequences 
compliance with these requirements directly influences idaho power company s operating environment and may significantly increase idaho power company s operating costs 
increased capital expenditures can significantly affect liquidity 
increases in both the number of customers and the demand for energy require expansion and reinforcement of transmission and distribution systems and generating facilities 
if idaho power company does not receive timely regulatory recovery  idaho power company will have to rely more on external financing for its future utility construction expenditures 
these large planned expenditures may weaken the consolidated financial profile of idacorp  inc and idaho power company 
additionally  a significant portion of idaho power company s facilities were constructed many years ago 
aging equipment  even if maintained in accordance with industry practices  may require significant capital expenditures 
failure of equipment or facilities used in idaho power company s system could potentially increase repair and maintenance expenses  purchased power expenses and capital expenditures 
as a holding company  idacorp  inc does not have its own operating income and must rely on the upstream cash flows from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make debt payments 
idacorp  inc is a holding company and thus its primary assets are shares or other ownership interests of its subsidiaries  primarily idaho power company 
consequently  idacorp  inc s ability to pay dividends and to service its debt is dependent upon dividends and other payments received from its subsidiaries 
idacorp  inc s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts to idacorp  inc  whether through dividends  loans or other payments 
the ability of idacorp  inc s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to idacorp  inc depends on several factors  including their actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial condition  and the prior rights of holders of their existing and future first mortgage bonds and other debt securities 
a downgrade in idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s credit ratings could negatively affect the companies ability to access capital  increase their cost of borrowing  and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties 
credit rating agencies periodically review the corporate credit ratings and long term ratings of idacorp  inc and idaho power company 
idacorp  inc 
and idaho power company also have borrowing arrangements that rely on the ability of the banks to fund loans or support commercial paper 
downgrades of idacorp  inc s or idaho power company s credit ratings  or those affecting bond insurers or relationship banks  could limit the companies ability to access capital  including the commercial paper markets  require idacorp  inc and idaho power company to pay a higher interest rate on their debt and require the companies to post collateral with transaction counterparties 
volatility and decreased lending capacity in the financial markets may negatively affect idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s ability to access capital and or increase their cost of borrowing 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company require liquidity to pay operating expenses and principal of and interest on debt and to finance capital expenditures 
financial markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and disruption  causing the cost of borrowing to rise and the availability of liquidity and credit for borrowers to decrease  actions taken by the united states government  the federal reserve and other governmental and regulatory bodies may not be sufficient to stabilize these markets 
as a result  idacorp  inc and idaho power company may experience higher interest costs and or be unable to access capital  including the commercial paper markets 
these conditions may adversely affect idacorp  inc s and idaho power company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
idacorp and idaho power company may incur losses on their investments or be unable to sell their investments when they desire to do so  which could adversely affect their liquidity and financial condition 
idacorp and idaho power company invest cash in short term interest bearing accounts  including money market funds 
volatility in the financial markets has resulted in a lack of liquidity and declines in value of some money market funds 
the companies may realize additional losses on some or all of their invested funds or be unable to sell their investments when they desire to do so 
this could adversely affect idacorp s and idaho power company s liquidity and financial condition 
national and regional economic conditions may cause increased late payments and uncollectible accounts  which would reduce earnings and cash flows 
recent concerns over inflation  energy costs  the availability and cost of credit  declining business and increased unemployment have contributed to a recession 
these factors have resulted  and may continue to result  in an increase in late payments and uncollectible accounts and reduce idacorp inc s and idaho power company s earnings and cash flows 
terrorist threats and activities could result in reduced revenues and increased costs 
idacorp  inc and idaho power company are subject to direct and indirect effects of terrorist threats and activities 
potential targets include generation and transmission facilities 
the effects of terrorist threats and activities could prevent idaho power company from purchasing  generating or transmitting power and result in reduced revenues and increased costs 
adverse results of income tax audits could reduce earnings and cash flows 
the outcome of ongoing and future income tax audits could differ materially from the amounts currently recorded  and the difference could reduce idacorp s and idaho power company s earnings and cash flows 
employee workforce factors could increase costs and reduce earnings 
idaho power company is subject to workforce factors  including loss or retirement of key personnel  availability of qualified personnel  and an aging workforce 
the costs of attracting and retaining appropriately qualified employees to replace an aging workforce could reduce earnings and cash flows

executive overview financial results idacorp s net income and earnings per diluted share for the last three years were as follows net income average outstanding shares diluted s earnings per diluted share the key factor affecting the change in idacorp s net income was ipc s operating income  which increased million over levels 
rate increases during and increased general business revenues in as compared to these increases combined with more favorable hydroelectric generating conditions resulted in improved operating income 
however  increases in operating and maintenance expenses and interest expense due to higher long term debt balances reduced the earnings contribution at ipc 
ipc earnings in the fourth quarter were also negatively impacted by a ferc decision that resulted in an increase to ipc s open access transmission tariff oatt refund to its transmission service customers and an impairment charge for a decline in the market value of equity securities 
the following table presents a reconciliation of idacorp net income for to shown net of tax idacorp net income increased electric utility operating income gain on sale of southwest intertie project swip decreased net income at ifs decreased loss at holding company increased ipc interest expense impairment of equity securities settlement of prior years tax returns other net increases idacorp net income increased electric utility operating income includes increased general business revenue of million  decreased other revenue of million due to the oatt refund  decreased net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less off system sales of million  a pca expense decrease of million  and increased o m expense of million 
business strategy idacorp is focusing on a strategy that emphasizes ipc as idacorp s core business 
although growth in number of customers slowed in  ipc is experiencing customer growth in its service area and must be prepared to meet customers electricity needs in the future 
this corporate strategy recognizes that ipc must make investments in infrastructure to ensure adequate supply and reliable service 
ipc s regulatory efforts have resulted in finalizing the general rate case and receiving an order in the general rate case 
ipc continues to make efforts to speed recovery of the financial and operating costs of new facilities and system improvements 
ifs and ida west remain components of the corporate strategy 
regulatory matters idaho general rate case on january   the ipuc issued its final order approving an average annual increase in idaho base rates  effective february   of percent approximately million annually  a return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
on february   ipc filed a request for reconsideration with the ipuc 
in its filing  ipc asked the ipuc to reconsider four principal areas of the order having a combined idaho jurisdictional revenue requirement impact of approximately million annually 
the request for reconsideration is discussed in more detail in regulatory matters idaho rate cases general rate case 
idaho general rate case on february   the ipuc approved a settlement of ipc s general rate case filed in  increasing base rates for residential customers percent and rates for the other classes of customers percent 
the rates became effective march   and increased ipc s annual revenue by million

power cost adjustment on may   the ipuc approved a million increase to revenues  effective june   which resulted in an average rate increase to ipc s customers of percent 
the increase is net of approximately million of gains on sales of excess emission allowances  including interest 
in its order  the ipuc also directed ipc to hold workshops to address pca related issues not resolved in the pca filing 
as a result of the workshops  a settlement stipulation was filed and was approved by the ipuc on january  the approved stipulation changes the sharing ratio between customers and shareholders to  adjusts the load growth adjustment rate lgar to per mwh based on the general rate case order  changes the source of the power supply cost forecast and authorizes inclusion of third party transmission expense in the pca formula 
the changes were effective february  the stipulation is discussed in more detail in regulatory matters deferred net power supply costs idaho pca workshops 
oregon power cost recovery mechanism on april   the opuc approved a power cost recovery mechanism with two components  the annual power cost update apcu and the power cost adjustment mechanism pcam 
the combination of the apcu and the pcam allows ipc to recover excess net power supply costs in a more timely fashion than through the previously existing deferral process 
the apcu allows ipc to reestablish its oregon base net power supply costs annually  separate from a general rate case  and to forecast net power supply costs for the upcoming water year 
the pcam is a true up that provides for percent customer sharing of deviations in actual net power supply costs from those included in the apcu if the deviations are outside of prescribed ranges and ipc meets a return on equity test 
these mechanisms are discussed in more detail in regulatory matters deferred net power supply costs oregon oregon power cost recovery mechanism 
oatt effective june   ipc s oatt was made a formula rate based on financial and operational data ipc is required to file annually with the ferc in its form on january   the ferc issued an unfavorable order affecting the way ipc calculates its oatt 
the order requires ipc to reduce its transmission service rates to ferc jurisdictional customers and make refunds in the total amount of million including million in interest for the period since june ipc had previously reserved a portion of this amount  but reserved an additional million including million in interest in the fourth quarter of to bring the total reserve amount to million

record system peaks ipc s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
ipc set a new system peak of  mw on june  the previous hourly system peak of  mw was set on july  although ipc was able to meet all of its load requirements during this period of increased demand  all available resources of ipc s system were fully committed 
integrated resource plan ipc filed its integrated resource plan irp with the ipuc in september and with the opuc in october the irp previewed ipc s load and resource situation for the next twenty years  analyzed potential supply side and demand side options and identified near term and long term actions 
prior to filing  the irp requires extensive involvement by ipc  the ipuc staff  the opuc staff  and customer and environmental representatives  as well as input on the cost of various generation technologies 
the irp is the starting point for demonstrating prudence in ipc s resource decisions 
the two primary goals of the irp were to identify sufficient resources to reliably serve the growing demand for electric service within ipc s service area throughout the year planning period and ensure that the portfolio of resources selected balances cost  risk and environmental concerns 
the ipuc accepted the irp in march and the opuc acknowledged the irp in september with its acceptance of the irp  the ipuc requested that ipc align the submittal of its next irp with those submitted by other idaho utilities 
to comply with this request  ipc provided updates on the status of the irp to both the ipuc and opuc in june and to the opuc in february and is currently preparing the irp which is scheduled to be completed in june see further discussion in regulatory matters integrated resource plan 
transmission projects ipc and pacificorp are jointly exploring the gateway west project to build transmission lines between windstar  a substation located near douglas  wyoming and hemingway  a substation located in the vicinity of melba and murphy  idaho near boise 
the lines would be designed to increase electrical transmission capacity across southern idaho in response to increasing customer demand and growth  along with other transmission service requests 
ipc and pacificorp have a cost sharing agreement for expenses associated with the analysis work of the initial phases 
ipc s share of the initial phase of engineering  environmental review  permitting and rights of way is approximately million 
initial phases of the project could be completed by depending on the timing of rights of way  acquisition  siting and permitting  and construction sequencing 
if all initial phases are constructed  ipc estimates that its share of the project costs could range between million and million 
remaining phases of the project could be constructed as demand requires 
consistent with the irp and requirements and requests of other transmission customers  ipc is exploring alternatives for the construction of a kv line between southwestern idaho and the northwest 
the boardman hemingway line is expected to relieve existing congestion by increasing transmission capacity and improving reliability 
it will allow for the transfer of up to  mw of additional energy between idaho and the northwest 
the initial project phase estimate of million will be funded by ipc and includes the engineering  environmental review  permitting and rights of way 
cost estimates for the project including initial phase project estimate and construction costs of the line are approximately million 
ipc expects to seek partners for up to percent of the project when construction commences 
the line has a target in service date of june please see further discussion in regulatory matters transmission projects boardman hemingway line 
in order to connect the gateway west project and the boardman hemingway line to ipc s primary load center and also to help meet forecast deficits and improve reliability  ipc is constructing a new kv station named hemingway 
as part of the hemingway station project  the new hemingway hubbard transmission line will provide power to the treasure valley in southwest idaho 
the project is expected to be completed by the project will include adding a kv double circuit transmission line and converting an existing kv to kv 
cost estimates for the hemingway station project include million for the station and million for the hemingway hubbard transmission line 
liquidity in the fourth quarter of  the global credit markets suffered a significant contraction  including the failure of some large financial institutions 
as a result  the us government took control of certain financial institutions  and some institutions were bought out or declared bankruptcy 
despite the recent turmoil in the global credit markets  idacorp and ipc had access to the capital markets and have been able to generate funds internally and externally to meet our capital requirements 
our ability to attract the necessary financial capital at reasonable terms is critical to our overall strategic plan because idacorp and ipc rely on access to both short term borrowings  including the issuance of commercial paper  and long term capital markets as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by internally generated funds 
idacorp and ipc have continued to issue commercial paper at times  but have also made draws under their respective credit facilities when commercial paper at desired maturities was not available 
idacorp and ipc expect that operating cash flow  together with the revolving credit facilities and other external financing  will be adequate to meet their operating and capital needs  although there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not restrict either company s ability to access these markets on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
pension plan financial market volatility and disruption caused a significant decline in the value of qualified pension assets 
current provisions of the pension protection act require that if a company does not maintain a percent funding status for  then the company will need to make additional contributions to become fully funded over a period of seven years 
based on the value of pension assets and interest rates as of december   the estimated minimum required contributions would be approximately million in and million for each of   and these estimates reflect the initial relief measures as passed by congress  however  additional measures are being proposed  which may impact immediate funding requirements 
capital requirements and cash flows idacorp estimates that it will spend between and million for construction related activities from to  excluding any amounts from our baseload resource rfp process 
forecasts indicate that internal cash generation after dividends will provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital requirements with internally generated funds and continued reliance on externally financed capital 
excluding the baseload resource decision  ipc expects financing needs in to be less than levels 
the amount of internal cash generation is dependent primarily upon ipc s cash flows from operations  which are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs and provide a return on investment 
equity issuances during  idacorp issued approximately million shares of common stock through its continuous equity program cep  dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  employee savings plan  restricted stock plan  and long term incentive and compensation plan 
approximately million of these shares were issued under the cep 
in  and  idacorp contributed million  million and million  respectively  of additional equity to ipc 
no additional shares of ipc common stock were issued 
idaho water management issues power generation at the ipc hydroelectric power plants on the snake river is dependent upon the state water rights held by ipc and the long term sustainability of the snake river  tributary spring flows and the eastern snake plain aquifer that is connected to the snake river 
ipc continues to participate in water management issues in idaho that may affect those water rights and resources with the goal to preserve  to the fullest extent possible  the long term availability of water for use at ipc s hydroelectric projects on the snake river 
ipc s involvement includes active participation in the snake river basin adjudication  a judicial action initiated in to determine the nature and extent of water use in the snake river basin  judicial and administrative proceedings relating to the conjunctive management of ground and surface water rights  and management and planning processes intended to reverse declining trends in river  spring  and aquifer levels and address the long term water resource needs of the state 
on occasion  resolution of these water management issues involves litigation 
ipc is involved in legal actions regarding not only its water rights but also the water rights of others

operating and financial metrics outlook the outlook for key operating and financial metrics for as compared to actual results for is key operating financial metrics estimate actual ipc operation maintenance expense millions ipc capital expenditures millions ipc hydroelectric generation million mwh non regulated subsidiary earnings and holding company expenses millions effective tax rates ipc consolidated idacorp ipc capital expenditures exclude costs for a baseload energy resource 
ipc will seek approval from the ipuc relating to the baseload resource during the first quarter of with a decision from the ipuc expected later in for the three year period  ipc expects to spend between million and million for construction related activities 
this amount includes expenditures for the siting and permitting of major transmission expansions for boardman to hemingway  gateway west  and for the hemingway station and hemingway to hubbard line 
as discussed above  the credit and financial markets have recently experienced volatility and disruption 
ipc has experienced a slowdown in new customer connections and one of ipc s largest industrial customers has announced workforce reductions 
as a result  ipc and idacorp have reduced or delayed many capital expenditures relating to customer growth and other non critical projects 
additionally  hiring restrictions have been implemented and are expected to slow the growth of operation and maintenance spending in the projected range for annual hydroelectric generation is based on snake river basin snowpack at percent of average on february   with reservoir storage levels in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee at approximately percent of average as of february  the stream flow forecast released on february   by the nwrfc predicts that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july will be maf  or percent of the nwrfc average 
the decrease in estimated non regulated subsidiary earnings from prior years is a result of expected declines in contributions from ifs because of lower tax benefits from aging investments and no significant new contributions expected in critical accounting policies and estimates when preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap  idacorp s and ipc s management must apply accounting policies and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates often involve judgment about factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
accounting for rate regulation in order to apply the accounting policies and practices of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  a regulated company must satisfy the following conditions an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
sfas requires companies that meet the above conditions to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and requires that certain costs be deferred as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities and amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
ipc follows sfas  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating ipc 
the primary effect of this policy is that ipc has recorded million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  while ipc expects to fully recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates  such recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory entities 
if future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable  or if ipc determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying sfas  ipc would be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities  unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
either circumstance could have a material effect on ipc s results of operations and financial position 
asset impairment available for sale securities ipc has investments in four mutual funds that experienced a significant decline in fair value in sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires that these and other securities be evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the cost of the investment is written down to fair value and the loss is recorded as a realized loss 
two significant factors that are considered when evaluating investments for impairment are the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost 
ipc s investments had lost between percent and percent of their value  primarily during the stock market downturn in september and october and had been in loss positions from six to months at december  because of the severity of the declines in value  ipc determined that the loss in value was other than temporary and recorded a pre tax loss of million in the fourth quarter of equity method investments ifs has affordable housing investments with a net book value of million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
except for one investment now consolidated in accordance with gaap  these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded under apb is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
impairment analyses on these investments were performed in and no impairment was noted 
these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future stream flows  revenues  cash flows and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
pension and other postretirement benefits ipc maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most employees  an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors called the senior management security plan smsp  and a postretirement medical benefit plan 
the costs idacorp and ipc record for these plans depend on the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations from which the expense is derived 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
specifically  idacorp and ipc utilize data published in the citigroup pension liability index and apply the rates therein against the projected cash outflows of the plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the pension expense will be decreased to percent from the percent used in rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk return relationships among asset classes 
the primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the return on year us treasury notes 
this historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on year us treasury notes  and the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance 
additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns  as well as worst case and best case scenarios 
based on the current interest rate environment  current rate of return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past years when interest rates were generally much higher 
gross pension and other postretirement benefit expense for these plans totaled million  million  and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor and amounts deferred as regulatory assets 
for  gross pension and other postretirement benefit costs are expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the change in the discount rate noted above  as well as a decrease in expected return on plan assets and a new amortization of net loss both caused by a decrease in plan assets due to poor market conditions during no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense discount rate rate of return millions of dollars effect of increase effect of decrease no cash contributions were required or made to the qualified plan from through  and a million contribution is calculated for though payment is not expected until 
under the smsp  ipc makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
benefit payments are expected to be million in and averaged million per year from to gross postretirement plan contributions are expected to be million in  and averaged million from to on june   the ipuc issued an order authorizing ipc to account for its defined benefit pension expense on a cash basis  and to defer and account for accrued pension expense under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as a regulatory asset 
the ipuc acknowledged that it is appropriate for ipc to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions 
ipc began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates 
the deferral of pension expense began in with million being deferred to a regulatory asset beginning in the third quarter 
at december   million of expense was deferred as a regulatory asset 
approximately million is expected to be deferred in please refer to note of idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information about the pension and postretirement plans 
contingent liabilities contingent liabilities are accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency in the notes to the financial statements is required 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
idacorp and ipc have a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory and legal matters 
if the recognition criteria of sfas have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements 
income taxes idacorp and ipc account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes and fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
judgment and estimation are used in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax related assets and liabilities 
the interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income  cash flows  and tax related assets and liabilities 
results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and ipc s earnings over the last three years 
in this analysis  the results of are compared to and the results of are compared to the following table presents earnings losses for idacorp and its subsidiaries ipc utility operations idacorp financial services idacorp energy ida west energy holding company expenses discontinued operations total earnings average outstanding shares diluted s earnings per diluted share utility operations operating environment ipc is one of the nation s few investor owned utilities with a predominantly hydroelectric generating base 
because of its reliance on hydroelectric generation  ipc s generation operations can be significantly affected by water conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of ipc s hydroelectric facilities  springtime snow pack run off  river base flows  spring flows  rainfall and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
during low water years  when stream flows into ipc s hydroelectric projects are reduced  ipc s hydroelectric generation is reduced 
this results in less generation from ipc s resource portfolio hydroelectric  coal fired and gas fired available for off system sales and  most likely  an increased use of purchased power to meet load requirements 
both of these situations a reduction in off system sales and an increased use of more expensive purchased power result in increased power supply costs 
during high water years  increased off system sales and the decreased need for purchased power reduce net power supply costs 
operations plans are developed during the year to provide guidance for generation resource utilization and energy market activities off system sales and power purchases 
the plans incorporate forecasts for generation unit availability  reservoir storage and stream flows  gas and coal prices  customer loads  energy market prices and other pertinent inputs 
consideration is given to when to use ipc s available resources to meet forecast loads and when to transact in the wholesale energy market 
the allocation of hydroelectric generation between heavy load and light load hours or calendar periods is considered in development of the operating plans 
this allocation is intended to utilize the flexibility of the hydroelectric system to shift generation to high value periods  while operating within the constraints imposed on the system 
ipc s energy risk management policy  unit operating requirements and other obligations provide the framework for the plans 
stream flow conditions improved slightly in resulting in million mwh generated from ipc s hydroelectric facilities  compared to million mwh in the observed stream flow data released in august  by the us army corps of engineers  northwest division indicated that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf  or percent of the national weather service northwest river forecast center nwrfc average 
brownlee reservoir inflow for totaled maf  or percent of the nwrfc average compared to maf in storage in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee as of february   was percent of average 
the stream flow forecast released on february   by the nwrfc predicts that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july will be maf  or percent of the nwrfc average 
in  ipc leased approximately maf of storage water from four sources in an effort to enhance hydroelectric generation 
this water was released during the higher demand summer and winter periods 
on december   ipc issued a request for proposals rfp seeking to acquire additional water through leases 
proposals were received in february and are currently being evaluated 
this action is in part to offset the impact of drought and changing water use patterns in southern idaho challenges diminishing the company s ability to meet mid summer electrical demands 
acquiring water through lease also helps ipc improve water quality and temperature conditions in the snake river as part of ongoing relicensing efforts associated with the hells canyon complex 
ipc plans to include these costs in its annual pca filing 
ipc s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
the all time system peak demand is  mw  set on june  the previous hourly system peak of  mw was set on july  although ipc was able to meet all of its load requirements during these periods of increased demand  all available resources of ipc s system were fully committed during several heavy load periods 
the all time winter peak demand is  mw set on january  the previous hourly system winter peak of  mw was set in the following table presents ipc s power supply for the last three years mwh hydroelectric thermal total system purchased generation generation generation power total ipc s modeled median annual hydroelectric generation is million mwh  based on hydrologic conditions for the period through and adjusted to reflect the current level of water resource development 
general business revenue the primary influences on electricity sales are weather  customer growth and economic conditions 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales 
precipitation levels during the agricultural growing season affect sales to customers who use electricity to operate irrigation pumps 
increased precipitation reduces electricity usage by these customers

rates rate increases improved general business revenue by million in as compared to a pca increase on june   increased rates by an average of percent  but was moderated by the prior year net effect of the percent pca reduction  which was partially offset by a one percent net base rate increase  customers customer growth improved general business revenue million for the year  as ipc experienced moderate customer growth in its service territory 
the general business customer base month average increased percent over prior year  and usage weather variations positively impacted general business revenue by million 
irrigation usage was higher due to drier than normal conditions in the summer of as compared to residential  industrial and commercial usage was positively impacted by warmer weather conditions during the summer months 
off system sales off system sales consist primarily of long term sales contracts and opportunity sales of surplus system energy 
the following table presents ipc s off system sales for the last three years revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh vs 
off system sales revenue declined percent in sales volumes decreased due to changes to ipc s risk management policy guidelines implemented in that have resulted in less forward sales activity overall 
revenue per mwh increased due to the impact of higher energy commodity prices through much of vs 
in  the mwh volume sold decreased percent and revenues decreased percent 
deteriorated stream flow conditions throughout southern idaho decreased total system generation and electricity available for surplus sales 
revenue decreases from lower volumes were moderated by higher prices 
prior year prices were lower due to the abundance of energy in the region 
other revenues the following table presents the components of other revenues transmission services and property rental provision for rate refund energy efficiency rate case tax settlement irrigation lost revenues total vs 
other revenues decreased million due mainly to the following provision for rate refund reduced revenues million compared to in january  the ferc issued an order finalizing an oatt rate increase that had been implemented in june ipc accrued an estimated refund pending the final rate order  but the final order requires a significantly higher refund 
of the total provision recorded in  million relates to transmission services  million relates to and million relates to the oatt is discussed in more detail in regulatory matters federal regulatory matters open access transmission tariff oatt  wheeling revenues increased million  and energy efficiency revenues increased million 
these revenues mirror program expenditures and result in a zero net impact on net income 
energy efficiency revenues and expenses have steadily increased as program activity has increased 
vs 
other revenues increased million due mainly to the following beginning in january  a new ipuc accounting order became effective for the treatment of ipc s energy efficiency expenses 
the million of energy efficiency costs are recorded in energy efficiency programs and are offset by the same amount recorded in other revenues resulting in no net effect on earnings 
see energy efficiency  other revenues increased million from the completed amortization of tax settlement and irrigation lost revenue accruals 
from june to may ipc was collecting and recording in general business revenues  with a corresponding reduction to other revenues  amounts related to a idaho general rate case tax settlement and amounts related to an irrigation load reduction program 
revenues for the rate case tax settlement were accrued from september to may  and transmission revenues increased million primarily due to the oatt rate increase that began in june purchased power the following table presents ipc s purchased power expenses and volumes expense mwh purchased cost per mwh purchased vs 
purchased power expense decreased million due to improved hydroelectric generation conditions and more normal weather  which allowed ipc to better utilize its own generation resources 
despite improved water conditions in the region  overall market prices remained higher early in the year due to a gradual spring runoff and a need to re fill reservoirs 
in addition  increases in energy commodity prices impacted the electricity market 
vs 
purchased power expense increased million in deteriorated system generation  due to poor hydroelectric generation conditions  combined with the second year in a row of record high temperatures and demand during july and august  led to increased purchases 
this increase in purchases was partially offset by a lower overall cost per mwh in during  ipc made forward purchases in conformance with its risk management policy in response to early water year indications that suggested continued drought conditions 
hydroelectric generation conditions for turned out to be more favorable than forecasted and actual market prices ended up being lower than the prices of the forward purchases 
these higher priced forward purchases inflated the cost per mwh that ipc realized for ipc began utilizing financial hedge instruments in in addition to physical forward power transactions for the purpose of mitigating price risk related to conforming to ipc s energy risk management policy  managing ipc s energy portfolio to meet customer load  and reacting to changes in market conditions to minimize net power supply costs 
fuel expense the following table presents ipc s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants fuel expense thermal mwh generated cost per mwh vs 
fuel expense increased million due to higher coal prices at the valmy and jim bridger plants 
coal prices at valmy increased percent due to higher transportation costs 
production costs at bridger coal company were percent higher due to difficulties with its underground longwall mining operation in january and february  the continued transition to underground mining operations  and rising prices for fuel and other commodities 
the increases were partially offset by a nine percent reduction in fuel expense at ipc s natural gas fired plants  which had favorable market conditions in the fourth quarter due to pipeline transportation constraints in the region 
vs 
fuel expense increased million in the increase is largely due to an percent rise in average prices accompanied by a five percent increase in mwh volume 
coal costs increased million due to higher market demand and higher rail transportation costs 
generation from the coal fired power plants was up three percent in  attributable to fewer planned and unplanned outages at valmy and boardman than the previous year 
additional generation from natural gas fired plants contributed million to the increase in fuel expense in these plants were readily available for dispatch in to meet peak loads and as market conditions warranted 
the bennett mountain plant was not available during the summer of due to a turbine failure 
pca pca expense represents the effects of the idaho pca and oregon pcam deferrals of net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less off system sales 
these mechanisms are discussed in more detail below in regulatory matters deferred net power supply costs 
the following table presents the components of the pca current year net power supply cost deferral amortization of prior year authorized balances total power cost adjustment vs 
the million decrease in pca expense is due primarily to higher amortization from prior year excess net power supply costs to match increased revenues 
in each year presented  net power supply costs were higher than the amounts estimated in the annual pca forecast  resulting in the deferral of costs for recovery in subsequent rate years 
as the deferred costs are being recovered in rates  the deferred balances are amortized 
vs 
in  net power supply costs were significantly higher than the amounts reflected in the annual pca forecast  while in the deferred costs were much lower due to good hydroelectric generation 
other operations and maintenance o m expenses vs 
other o m expenses increased million due mainly to the following an increase in labor related expenses of million due to higher incentive based compensation  salaries and employee count  new water leases of million to optimize our hydroelectric generation  uncollectible accounts increased million  primarily due to deteriorating economic conditions in ipc s service area  an increase of million in outside services  an increase of million for reserves for workers compensation and legal matters  transmission costs decreased million due to lower purchased power volumes  thermal o m expenses decreased million due to lower annual outages  and fca charges decreased million due to a million change in the amount deferred and a million increase in amortization of the prior year amounts 
vs 
other o m expenses increased million due mainly to the following regulatory commission expenses increased million primarily due to the september reversal of ferc fee accruals of million and an increase in legal fees of million related to the oatt filing and the ferc investigation  transmission o m expenses increased million due to higher third party transmission costs  outside services increased million primarily due to an increase in intercompany allocations as well as legal fees  distribution o m expense increased million due to an increase in overhead line maintenance  thermal o m expenses increased million 
while much of this increase was due to a planned increase in maintenance activity  the increase also occurred due to unanticipated overhaul costs during the annual outages in the first half of the year  hydroelectric o m expenses increased million due to the resumption of american falls bond principal amortization  additional ferc hydroelectric license compliance costs  ferc required inspection costs  and general labor cost increases  and expense for the fixed cost adjustment mechanism  which began in  was million

at december   no loans were outstanding on ipc s facility and million of commercial paper was outstanding 
at february   no loans and million of commercial paper was outstanding 
both the idacorp facility and the ipc facility have similar terms and conditions 
under the terms of the facilities idacorp and ipc may borrow floating rate advances and eurodollar rate advances 
the floating rate is equal to the higher of i the prime rate announced by wachovia bank or its parent and ii the sum of the federal funds effective rate for such day plus percent per annum  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the eurodollar rate is based upon the british bankers association interest settlement rate for deposits in us dollars published on the reuters telerate page successor as adjusted by the applicable reserve requirement for eurocurrency liabilities imposed under regulation d of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  for periods of one  two  three or six months plus the applicable margin 
the margin is based on the applicable company s rating for senior unsecured long term debt securities without third party credit enhancement as provided by moody s investors service moody s and standard poor s ratings services s p  based on the higher of the two ratings 
if the ratings are split between moody s and s p and the differential is two levels or more  the intermediate rating at the midpoint will apply 
if there is no midpoint  the higher of the two intermediate ratings will apply 
the margin for the floating rate advances is zero percent unless the applicable company s rating falls below baa from moody s or bbb from s p  at which time it would equal percent 
the margin for eurodollar rate advances ranges from percent to percent depending upon the credit rating 
in addition to the margin  if the outstanding aggregate credit exposure exceeds percent of the facility amount  idacorp or ipc  as applicable  would pay a utilization fee ranging from percent to percent on outstanding loans depending on the credit rating 
at december   the applicable margin under the idacorp facility and the ipc facility was zero percent for floating rate advances and percent for ipc and percent for idacorp for eurodollar rate advances 
the utilization fee was percent for both companies 
a facility fee  payable quarterly  is calculated on the average daily aggregate commitment of the lenders under the relevant credit facility and is also based on the applicable company s rating from moody s or s p as indicated above 
at december   the facility fee under the idacorp and ipc facilities was percent and percent  respectively 
in connection with the issuance of letters of credit  idacorp and ipc  as applicable  must pay i a fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate advances on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such letters of credit  payable quarterly in arrears  ii a fronting fee at a per annum rate of percent on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit  payable quarterly in arrears and iii documentary and processing charges in accordance with the letter of credit issuer s standard schedule for such charges 
a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing and of maintaining letters of credit  but would not result in any default or acceleration of the debt under either the idacorp facility or the ipc facility 
the events of default under both the idacorp facility and the ipc facility include i nonpayment of principal when due and nonpayment of reimbursement obligations under letters of credit within one business day after becoming due and nonpayment of interest or other fees within five days after becoming due  ii materially false representations or warranties made on behalf of the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries on the date as of which made  iii breach of covenants  subject in some instances to grace periods  iv voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy of the applicable company or any material subsidiary  v the non consensual appointment of a receiver or similar official for the applicable company or any of its material subsidiaries or any substantial portion as defined in the applicable facility of its property  vi condemnation of all or any substantial portion of the property of the applicable company and its subsidiaries  vii default in the payment of indebtedness in excess of million or a default by the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries under any agreement under which such debt was created or governed which will cause or permit the acceleration of such debt or if any of such debt is declared to be due and payable prior to its stated maturity  viii the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries not paying  or admitting in writing its inability to pay  its debts as they become due  ix the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries failing to pay certain judgments  x the acquisition by any person or two or more persons acting in concert of beneficial ownership within the meaning of rule d of the securities exchange act of of percent or more of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the applicable company  xi the failure of idacorp to own free and clear of all liens  all of the outstanding shares of voting stock of ipc  xii unfunded liabilities of all single employer plans under the employee retirement income security act of exceeding million  and xiii the applicable company or any subsidiary being subject to any proceeding or investigation pertaining to the release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment or any violation of any environmental law as defined in the applicable facility which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect as defined in the applicable facility 
a default or an acceleration of indebtedness of idacorp or ipc in excess of million  including indebtedness under the applicable facility  will result in a cross default under the other facility 
upon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of idacorp or ipc or the appointment of a receiver  the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and of the letter of credit issuer to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable 
upon any other event of default  the lenders holding percent of the outstanding loans or percent of the aggregate commitments required lenders or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and of the letter of credit issuer to issue letters of credit under the facility or declare the obligations to be due and payable 
idacorp and ipc will also be required to deposit into a collateral account an amount equal to the aggregate undrawn stated amount under all outstanding letters of credit and the aggregate unpaid reimbursement obligations thereunder 
if there is a ratings downgrade below investment grade bbb or higher by s p and baa or higher by moody s  then ipc s authority for continuing borrowings under its regulatory approvals issued by the ipuc and the opuc must be extended or renewed during the occurrence of the ratings downgrade 
the oregon statutes  however  permit the issuance or renewal of indebtedness maturing not more than one year after the date of such issue or renewal without approval of the opuc 
the ipuc order provides that ipc s authority will not terminate but will continue for a period of days from any downgrade below investment grade provided that ipc notifies the ipuc promptly and files a supplemental application with the ipuc within days requesting a supplemental order to continue its original authority to borrow under the order 
during  bankruptcies and other significant financial difficulties impacted the ability of some banks to continue fulfilling their commitments under established credit facilities 
these issues did not impact either the idacorp or ipc credit facilities 
while some consolidation occurred within the credit facility bank group  no banks limited or reduced their commitments under our facilities

ipc used the proceeds to effect a mandatory purchase on april   of the pollution control bonds as discussed below in pollution control revenue refunding bonds  and to pay interest  fees and expenses incurred in connection with the pollution control bonds and the term loan credit agreement 
on february   ipc entered into a new million term loan credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent and lender  bank of america  na  union bank  na and wachovia bank  national association  as lenders 
ipc used the proceeds to repay the above mentioned term loan credit agreement 
the loans are due on february   but are subject to earlier payment if ipc remarkets the pollution control revenue refunding bonds discussed below 
the loans may be prepaid but may not be reborrowed 
the loans bear interest at either a floating rate or a eurodollar rate 
the floating rate is equal to i the highest of a the prime rate announced by jpmorgan chase bank on such day  b the sum of the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus percent per annum and c an amount equal to the libo reference rate on such day plus percent plus ii the applicable margin 
the eurodollar rate is i the rate published on the reuters bba libor rates page or on any successor or substitute page for dollar deposits with a comparable maturity plus ii the applicable margin 
the libo reference rate is the rate appearing on the reuters bba libor rates page or on any successor or substitute page as the rate for united states dollar deposits for a one month interest period 
the applicable margin is currently percent for eurodollar advances and percent for floating rate advances  but may be increased or decreased based upon the ratings assigned to ipc s senior unsecured debt by moody s and s p 
the events of default under the term loan credit agreement are the same as those under the ipc facility discussed above 
without additional approval from the idaho public utilities commission  the public utility commission of oregon and the public service commission of wyoming  the aggregate amount of borrowings by ipc under the term loan credit agreement together with any other short term borrowings at any one time outstanding may not exceed million 
pollution control revenue refunding bonds two series of bonds have been issued for the benefit of ipc and are each supported by a financial guaranty insurance policy issued by ambac assurance corporation ambac

on april   ipc made a mandatory purchase of the pollution control bonds 
ipc initiated this transaction in order to adjust the interest rate period of the pollution control bonds from an auction interest rate period to a weekly interest rate period  effective april  this change was made to mitigate the higher than anticipated interest costs in the auction mode  which was a result of ambac s credit ratings deterioration 
ipc is the current holder of the bonds  but ultimately expects to remarket the bonds to investors 
debt covenants the idacorp facility  the ipc facility and the term loan credit agreement each contain a covenant requiring the company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of no more than percent as of the end of each fiscal quarter

remaining phases of the project could be constructed as demand requires 
baseload resource ipc issued an rfp in for a resource to meet energy needs identified during its irp process 
ipc prepared a self build proposal for a combined cycle combustion turbine  which serves as a benchmark resource and is competing in the rfp evaluation process 
proposals were received in october and are currently being evaluated

from through  total environmental related operating costs are estimated to be approximately million 
expenses related to the hydroelectric facilities are expected to be million and thermal plant expenses are expected to total million during this period 
these amounts do not include costs related to possible changes in the environmental legislation and enforcement policies that may be enacted in response to issues such as climate change and other pollutant emissions from coal fired generation plants 
off balance sheet arrangements the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes establish operational  reclamation and closure standards that must be met during and upon completion of mining activities 
these obligations mandate that mine property be restored consistent with specific standards and the approved reclamation plan 
the mining operations at the bridger coal company are subject to these reclamation and closure requirements 
ipc has agreed to guarantee the performance of reclamation activities at bridger coal  of which ierco owns a one third interest 
this guarantee  which is renewed each december  was million at december  bridger coal has a reclamation trust fund set aside specifically for the purpose of paying the reclamation costs and expects that the fund will be sufficient to cover all such costs 
because of the existence of the fund  the estimated fair value of this guarantee is minimal 
regulatory matters idaho rate cases general rate case on june   ipc filed an application with the ipuc requesting an average rate increase of approximately percent 
ipc s proposal would have increased its revenues million annually 
the application included a requested return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
ipc filed its case based upon a forecast test year 
on january   the ipuc issued an order approving an average annual increase in idaho base rates  effective february   of percent approximately million annually  a return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
the order authorized ipc to include in rates approximately million of afudc relating to the hells canyon complex relicensing project 
typically afudc is not included in rates until a project is in use and benefitting customers  but the ipuc determined that including this amount in current rates is in the public interest 
on february   ipc filed a request for reconsideration with the ipuc 
in its filing  ipc asked the ipuc to reconsider four principal areas of the order 
together  the four areas have a combined idaho jurisdictional revenue requirement impact of approximately million annually 
two of the four areas involve reconciling the calculation of ipc s revenue requirement with the order 
these items approximately million in annual revenues relate to the annual amount of labor expense to be included in rates 
ipc believes that some aspects of calculation of the revenue requirement with respect to these items were inconsistent with the language of the order 
the third area relates to a million expense credit received in as a result of successful litigation with the ferc and other federal agencies ferc credit 
in the order  the ipuc directed ipc to refund the ferc credit to customers over a five year period  thereby reducing ipc s annual revenue requirement by approximately million during such period 
ipc believes that this was contrary to idaho law 
if ipc is unsuccessful in its challenge of the ipuc s ruling on the ferc credit  it will recognize a loss for some or all of this amount 
the fourth area involves the use of purchasing cards p cards  which ipc issues to a number of its employees to efficiently process high volume  low value purchases 
in its order  the ipuc accepted the ipuc staff s recommendation to remove approximately million of p card expenses from ipc s revenue requirement because the ipuc staff believed this amount was excessive 
ipc believes that the ipuc s decision to deny recovery of million of p card purchases was not supported by evidence in the record 
the ipuc has days in which to decide whether to grant ipc s petition 
if the petition is granted  then the matter must be reheard  or written briefs filed  within weeks after the petition filing date  and the ipuc will then have days to issue its order 
other parties may also file petitions or cross petitions for reconsideration 
general rate case on june   ipc filed an application with the ipuc requesting an average rate increase of percent million annually 
on february   the ipuc approved a settlement stipulation that included an average increase in base rates of percent approximately million annually  effective march  the settlement did not specify an overall rate of return or a return on equity 
forecast test year workshop on march   ipc  the ipuc staff  and other parties to the general rate case conducted a workshop to discuss the appropriate approach to the development of a forecast test year 
ipc described a method that would start with historical  regulatory adjusted financial information that could be audited by the ipuc staff and others 
that information would be escalated under commonly accepted methods into the forecast test year for revenues  expenses and rate base 
ipc would support the historical information  the adjustments  and the escalation methods as part of its general rate case filing 
the parties to the workshop expressed general agreement to this approach and also agreed that no further workshops would be necessary 
ipc developed the test year using this method in its general rate case filing made on june  and approved on january   as discussed above 
danskin ct power plant rate case on march   ipc filed an application with the ipuc requesting recovery of construction costs associated with the gas fired danskin ct plant located near mountain home  idaho 
danskin ct began commercial operations on march  ipc requested adding to rate base approximately million attributable to the cost of constructing the generating facility and the related transmission and interconnection facilities  which would have resulted in a base rate increase of percent  or approximately million in annual revenues 
on may   the ipuc authorized ipc to add to its rate base million for the danskin ct plant and related facilities  effective june   resulting in a base rate increase of percent  or million in annual revenues 
costs not approved in this order will be included in future filings 
deferred net power supply costs ipc s deferred net power supply costs consisted of the following at december in thousands of dollars idaho pca current year deferral for the rate year deferral for the rate year idaho pca true up awaiting recovery authorized may authorized may oregon deferral costs costs pcam total deferral the pca deferral balance is reduced by million of emission allowance sales in idaho ipc has a pca mechanism that provides for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho retail customers 
the pca tracks ipc s actual net power supply costs fuel and purchased power less off system sales and compares these amounts to net power supply costs currently being recovered in retail rates 
the annual adjustments are based on two components a forecast component  based on a forecast of net power supply costs in the coming year as compared to net power supply costs in base rates  and a true up component  based on the difference between the previous year s actual net power supply costs and the previous year s forecast 
this component also includes a balancing mechanism so that  over time  the actual collection or refund of authorized true up dollars matches the amounts authorized 
the true up component is calculated monthly  and interest is applied to the balance 
prior to february   the pca mechanism provided that percent of deviations in power supply costs were to be reflected in ipc s rates for both the forecast and the true up components 
pca on may   the ipuc approved ipc s pca and an increase to existing revenues of million  effective june   which resulted in an average rate increase to ipc s customers of percent 
the ipuc s order adopted an ipuc staff proposal to use a normal forecast for power supply costs 
the revenue increase is net of million of gains from the sale of excess so 

emission allowances  including interest  which the ipuc ordered be applied against the pca 
pca workshops in its may  order approving ipc s pca  the ipuc also directed ipc to set up workshops with the ipuc staff and several of ipc s largest customers together  the parties to address pca related issues not resolved in the pca filing 
consensus was reached on all items except allocation of the pca among customer classes  which will be re examined following the conclusion of the general rate case 
a settlement stipulation was filed with the ipuc and approved on january  the following changes were effective as of february  pca sharing methodology of the pca sharing methodology allocates the costs and benefits of net power supply expenses between customers percent and shareholders percent 
the previous sharing ratio was load growth adjustment rate lgar of per mwh the lgar is an element of the pca formula that is intended to eliminate recovery of power supply expenses associated with load growth resulting from changing weather conditions  a growing customer base  or changing customer use patterns 
the general rate case reset the lgar from to per mwh  but applied that rate to only percent of the load growth beginning in march in the stipulation  the parties agreed on a formula that  based on filed data from the general rate case  would have produced an lgar of per mwh 
while not quantified in the general rate case order  ipc believes that the lgar methodology approved in the stipulation results in a lgar of per mwh 
in its request for reconsideration of the ipuc s general rate case order  ipc also requested that the ipuc confirm this amount is correct 
use of ipc s operation plan power supply cost forecast the operation plan forecast may better match current collections with actual net power supply costs in the year they are incurred and result in smaller amounts being included in the following year s true up rate 
this new methodology will be used to prepare ipc s next pca filing in april inclusion of third party transmission expense transmission expenses paid to third parties to facilitate wholesale purchases and sales of energy  including losses  are a necessary component of net power supply costs 
deviation in these types of costs from levels included in base rates is now reflected in pca computations 
adjusted distribution of base net power supply costs base net power supply costs are distributed throughout the year based upon the monthly shape of normalized revenues for purposes of the pca deferral calculation 
pca on may   the ipuc approved ipc s pca filing 
the filing increased the pca component of customers rates from the then existing level  which was million below base rates  to a level that was million above those base rates 
this million increase was net of million of proceeds from sales of excess so emission allowances 
the new rates became effective june emission allowances during  ipc sold  so 

emission allowances for a total of million 
the sales proceeds allocated to the idaho jurisdiction were approximately million 
on april   the ipuc ordered that million of these proceeds  including interest  be used to help offset the pca true up balances from the pca 
the order also provided that million may be used to fund an energy education program 
in and early  ipc sold  so emission allowances for a total of million 
the sales proceeds allocated to the idaho jurisdiction were approximately million 
on may   the ipuc approved a stipulation that allowed ipc to retain ten percent as a shareholder benefit with the remaining percent plus a carrying charge recorded as a customer benefit 
this customer benefit was used to partially offset the pca true up balance and was reflected in pca rates in effect from june   to may  the bulk of ipc s accumulated excess emission allowances were sold during the period 
ipc anticipates realizing approximately  excess so emission allowances annually for the near future 
tighter emission restrictions are expected in the long term which may cause ipc to use more emission allowances for its own requirements and reduce the annual amount of excess emission allowances 
oregon on april   ipc filed for an accounting order with the opuc to defer net power supply costs for the period from may   through april   in anticipation of higher than normal higher than base power supply expenses 
in the filing  ipc included a forecast of oregon s jurisdictional share of excess power supply costs of million 
a hearing is set for april  on april   ipc filed for an accounting order with the opuc to defer net power supply costs for the period of may   through april  a settlement agreement was reached with the opuc staff and the citizens utility board in the amount of million  which was approved by the opuc on december  the timing of future recovery of oregon power supply cost deferrals is subject to an oregon statute that specifically limits rate amortizations of deferred costs to six percent of gross oregon revenue per year 
ipc is currently amortizing through rates power supply costs associated with the western energy situation of and  which is discussed further under legal and environmental issues western energy proceeding at the ferc 
full recovery of the deferral is not expected until the and the deferrals would have to be amortized sequentially following the full recovery of the deferral 
oregon power cost recovery mechanism on august   ipc filed an application with the opuc requesting the approval of a power cost recovery mechanism similar to the idaho pca 
a joint stipulation was filed with the opuc on march   and the opuc approved the stipulation on april  the stipulation and opuc order established a power cost recovery mechanism with two components the annual power cost update apcu and the power cost adjustment mechanism pcam 
the combination of the apcu and the pcam allows ipc to recover excess net power supply costs in a more timely fashion than through the previously existing deferral process 
apcu the apcu allows ipc to reestablish its oregon base net power supply costs annually  separate from a general rate case  and to forecast net power supply costs for the upcoming water year 
the apcu has two components the october update  where each october ipc calculates its estimated normalized net power supply expenses for the following april through march test period  and the march forecast  where each march ipc files a forecast of its expected net power supply expenses for the same test period  updated for a number of variables including the most recent stream flow data and future wholesale electric prices 
on june of each year  rates are adjusted to reflect costs calculated in the apcu 
on october   ipc filed the october update portion of its apcu with the opuc reflecting the estimated net power supply expenses for the april through march test period 
on march   ipc submitted testimony to the opuc revising its calculation of the october update to conform to the methodology agreed to by the parties in the stipulation 
ipc also submitted the march forecast  reflecting expected hydroelectric generating conditions and forward prices for the april through march test period 
the expected power supply costs of million represented an increase of approximately million over the october update 
on may   the opuc approved ipc s apcu comprising both the october update and the march forecast with the new rates effective june  the approved apcu resulted in a million  or percent  increase in oregon revenues 
on october   ipc filed the october update portion of its apcu with the opuc 
the filing  combined with supplemental testimony filed on december   reflects that revenues associated with ipc s base net power supply costs would be increased by million over the previous october update  an average percent increase 
the october update will be combined with the march forecast portion of the apcu  with final rates expected to become effective on june  pcam the pcam is a true up to be filed annually in february 
the filing calculates the deviation between actual net power supply expenses incurred for the preceding calendar year and the net power supply expenses recovered through the apcu for the same period 
under the pcam  ipc is subject to a portion of the business risk or benefit associated with this deviation through application of an asymmetrical deadband or range of deviations within which ipc absorbs cost increases or decreases 
for deviations in actual power supply costs outside of the deadband  the pcam provides for sharing of costs and benefits between customers and ipc 
however  a collection will occur only to the extent that it results in ipc s actual return on equity roe for the year being no greater than basis points below ipc s last authorized roe 
a refund will occur only to the extent that it results in ipc s actual roe for that year being no less than basis points above ipc s last authorized roe 
the pcam rate is then added to or subtracted from the apcu rate  with new combined rates effective each june on october   the opuc provided an order clarifying that the pcam is a deferral under the oregon statute 
ipc expects that deferrals under the pcam component will be subject to the six percent limitation on annual amortization discussed above 
ipc had million deferred under the pcam as of december  ipc expects to make its first pcam filing on february  fixed cost adjustment mechanism fca on march   the ipuc approved the implementation of a fca mechanism pilot program for ipc s residential and small general service customers 
the fca is a rate mechanism designed to remove ipc s disincentive to invest in energy efficiency programs by separating or decoupling the recovery of fixed costs from the variable kilowatt hour charge and linking it instead to a set amount per customer 
in the fca  for each customer class  the number of customers is multiplied by a fixed cost per customer 
the cost per customer is based on ipc s revenue requirement as established in a general rate case 
this authorized fixed cost recovery amount is compared to the amount of fixed costs actually recovered by ipc 
the amount of over or under recovery is then returned to or collected from customers in a subsequent rate adjustment 
the pilot program began on january   and runs through  with the first rate adjustment occurring on june   and subsequent rate adjustments occurring on june of each year during its term 
on march   ipc filed an application requesting a million rate reduction under the fca pilot program for the net over recovery of fixed costs during on may   the ipuc approved the rate reduction of million to be distributed to residential and small general service customer classes equally on an energy used basis during the june   through may   fca year 
ipc deferred million of fca net under recovery of fixed costs during idaho energy efficiency rider on march   ipc filed an application with the ipuc requesting an increase to its energy efficiency rider rider  which is the chief funding mechanism for ipc s investment in conservation  energy efficiency and demand response programs 
ipc proposed an increase from percent to percent of base revenues  or to approximately million annually  effective june  the application also sought authorization to eliminate the current funding caps for residential and irrigation customers  which is expected to result in more equitable cost recovery between customer classes  and authorization to utilize rider funding to support customer programs aimed at the installation of small scale renewable energy projects 
on may   the ipuc approved ipc s application to increase the rider from percent to percent of base revenues  effective june   and approved ipc s request to eliminate the caps on the rider for residential and irrigation customers 
the ipuc denied ipc s request to utilize rider funding to support customer programs aimed at the installation of small scale renewable energy projects  but directed ipc to work with the ipuc staff and other interested parties to develop a renewable energy program and submit it to the ipuc for approval 
prudency review in the general rate case  ipc requested that the ipuc explicitly find that ipc s expenditures between and of million of funds obtained from the rider were prudently incurred and would  therefore  no longer be subject to potential disallowance 
the ipuc staff recommended that the ipuc defer a prudency determination for these expenditures until ipc was able to provide a comprehensive evaluation package of its programs and efforts 
ipc contended that sufficient information had already been provided to the ipuc staff for review 
on february   ipc filed a stipulation with the ipuc reflecting an agreement with the ipuc staff on million of the rider funds 
the ipuc staff agreed that this portion of the rider expenditures were prudently incurred 
ipc and the ipuc staff agreed to continue to exchange information and discuss settlement with regard to the remaining million  and ipc will file a pleading with the ipuc by april  seeking a prudency determination on the remainder 
if resolution with respect to the remaining million cannot be reached in the proceedings stemming from the april  filing  ipc and the ipuc staff will recommend a procedure to allow the ipuc to make such a determination 
depreciation filings on september   the ipuc approved a revision to ipc s depreciation rates  retroactive to august  the new rates are based on a settlement reached by ipc and the ipuc staff  and result in an annual reduction of depreciation expense of million million allocated to idaho based upon december   depreciable electric plant in service 
on october   ipc filed an application with the opuc requesting that the new depreciation rates approved in ipc s idaho jurisdiction be authorized for ipc s oregon jurisdiction as well 
the result for the oregon jurisdiction would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense and rates of million 
this matter is pending and no order has been issued 
this request was filed in conjunction with the october   application discussed below in advanced metering infrastructure ami 
on october   ipc filed an application with the ferc requesting that ipc s revised depreciation rates as approved by the ipuc also be accepted for use in future rate filings made with the ferc 
the ferc approved ipc s application on december  the new depreciation accrual rates will be reflected in ipc s oatt rates beginning october advanced metering infrastructure ami the ami project provides the means to automatically retrieve energy consumption information  eliminating manual meter reading expense 
in the future  the system will support enhancements to allow for time variant rates  perform remote connects and disconnects  and collect system operations data enhancing outage management  reliability efforts and demand side management options 
ipc filed ami evaluation and deployment reports with the ipuc on may and august   in compliance with an ipuc order 
consistent with the implementation plan contained in those reports  ipc has entered into a number of contracts for materials and resources that allowed for the ami implementation to commence in late ipc intends to install this technology for approximately percent of its customers by the end of the executed contracts do not obligate ipc for any level of purchases and specifically allow ipc to cancel the contracts in the event that appropriate regulatory treatment regarding cost recovery is not granted 
idaho on august   ipc filed an application with the ipuc requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the deployment of ami technology and approval of accelerated depreciation for the existing metering equipment 
the ipuc approved ipc s application on february  in its application  ipc estimated the three year investment in ami to be million 
the revenue requirement impact of the ami deployment is estimated to be million 
the effect on rates will be addressed in subsequent proceedings 
oregon on october   ipc filed an application with the opuc requesting authority to accelerate the depreciation and recovery of existing meters in the oregon jurisdiction over an month period beginning january the opuc approved ipc s request on december  ipc s ami deployment schedule calls for the replacement of the oregon service territory meters around october the existing meters will be fully depreciated prior to their removal from service 
the estimated balance of plant in service at december   attributable to the existing meters is million 
the approval of this application results in an increase of million for in both rates and depreciation expense 
this increase will be partially offset by the request for revised depreciation rates filed in the same application and discussed above in depreciation filings  subject to true up if the depreciation rates the opuc ultimately approves differ from those that were approved by the ipuc 
idaho pension expense order in the idaho general rate case  the ipuc disallowed recovery of pension expense because there were no current cash contributions being made to the pension plan 
on march   ipc requested that the ipuc clarify that ipc can consider future cash contributions made to the pension plan a recoverable cost of service 
on june   the ipuc issued an order authorizing ipc to account for its defined benefit pension expense on a cash basis  and to defer and account for pension expense under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as a regulatory asset 
the ipuc acknowledged that it is appropriate for ipc to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions 
the regulatory asset created by this order is expected to be amortized to expense to match the revenues received when future pension contributions are recovered through rates 
the deferral of pension expense did not begin until million of past contributions still recorded on the balance sheet at december   were expensed 
for  approximately million was deferred to a regulatory asset beginning in the third quarter 
in  million of pension expense was deferred 
ipc did not request a carrying charge on the deferral balance 
federal regulatory matters the bonneville power administration residential exchange program the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act of  through the residential exchange program  has provided access to the benefits of low cost federal hydroelectric power to residential and small farm customers of the region s investor owned utilities ious 
the program is administered by the bonneville power administration bpa 
pursuant to agreements between the bpa and ipc  benefits from the bpa were passed through to ipc s idaho and oregon residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits 
on may   the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that the settlement agreements entered into between the bpa and the ious including ipc are inconsistent with the northwest power act 
on may   the bpa notified ipc and six other ious that it was immediately suspending the residential exchange program payments that the utilities pass through to their residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits 
ipc took action with both the ipuc and the opuc to reduce the level of credit on its customers bills to zero  effective june  since that time ipc has been working with the other northwest ious and consumer owned utilities  northwest state public utility commissions and the bpa to craft an agreement so that residential and small farm customers of ipc can resume sharing in the benefits of the federal columbia river power system 
however  the matter has yet to be resolved 
the bpa has initiated several public processes  which ultimately will determine whether benefits will be restored to ipc customers 
the most significant of these processes are the establishment of new residential purchase and sales agreements rpsas and the wp supplemental rate case 
the rpsas are intended to replace the settlement agreements invalidated by the court and to provide the structure through which benefits will be shared with the residential and small farm customers of ious 
the wp case addresses the calculation of overpayment if any of benefits to customers of the ious under the settlement agreements and whether those overpayments must be repaid by a reduction to future benefits 
the bpa issued a final record of decision rod on september  to establish new rpsas and another rod on september  in the wp case 
together the rods continue to reflect no residential exchange benefits for ipc s residential and small farm customers in the foreseeable future 
ipc has filed petitions for review in the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit challenging both rods the rpsas on november  and the wp case on december  a mediation process within the ninth circuit court has been initiated in an attempt to settle residential exchange program issues 
the appeals proceedings are being held in abeyance during the mediation process 
a meeting was held on february  between the bpa  ious and consumer owned utilities to determine if there is common ground for an overall settlement of the residential exchange program 
two additional meetings are scheduled for march if mediation is unsuccessful  briefing schedules will be set 
ipc will continue its efforts to secure future benefits for its customers 
since these benefits were passed through to ipc s customers  the outcome of this matter is not expected to have an effect on ipc s financial condition or results of operations 
oatt on march   ipc submitted a revised oatt filing with the ferc requesting an increase in transmission rates 
in the filing  ipc proposed to move from a fixed rate to a formula rate  which allows for transmission rates to be updated each year based on financial and operational data ipc is required to file annually with the ferc in its form the formula rate request included a rate of return on equity of percent 
ipc s filing was opposed by several affected parties 
effective june   the ferc accepted ipc s proposed new rates  subject to refund pending the outcome of the hearing and settlement process 
on august   the ferc approved a settlement agreement by the parties on all issues except the treatment of contracts for transmission service that contain their own terms  conditions and rates that were in existence before the implementation of oatt in legacy agreements 
this settlement reduced ipc s proposed new rates and  as a result  approximately million collected in excess of the settlement rates between june   and july   was refunded with interest in august as part of the settlement agreement  the ferc established an authorized rate of return on equity of percent 
on august   the ferc presiding administrative law judge alj issued an initial decision initial decision with respect to the treatment of the legacy agreements  which would have further reduced the new transmission rates 
ipc  as well as the opposing parties  appealed the initial decision to the ferc 
if implemented  the initial decision would have required ipc to make additional refunds  including interest  of approximately million including million of interest for the june   through december   period 
ipc previously reserved this entire amount 
on january   the ferc issued an order on initial decision ferc order  which upheld the initial decision of the alj in most respects  but modified the initial decision in one respect that is unfavorable to ipc 
the decision requires ipc to reduce its transmission service rates to ferc jurisdictional customers 
furthermore  ipc is required to make refunds to ferc jurisdictional transmission customers in the total amount of million including million in interest for the period since the new rates went into effect in june based on the ferc order ipc reserved an additional million including million in interest in the fourth quarter of  bringing the total reserve amount to million 
prior to the ferc order  the ferc jurisdictional transmission revenues net of the million reserve recorded in the last seven months of  all of and were million  million and million  respectively 
under the ferc order  the transmission revenues would have been million in the last seven months of  million in and million in refunds were made on february  ipc filed a request for rehearing with the ferc on february  ipc believes that the treatment of the legacy agreements conflicts with precedent 
the rehearing request asserts that the ferc order is in error by requiring ipc to include the contract demands associated with the legacy agreements in the oatt formula rate divisor rather than crediting the revenue from the legacy agreements against ipc s transmission revenue requirement  concluding that ipc must include the contract demands associated with the legacy agreements rather than the customers coincident peak demands  concluding that the transmission rate contained in one or more of the legacy agreements was not a discounted rate  failing to consider the non monetary benefits received by ipc from the legacy agreements  concluding that the services provided under the legacy agreements are firm services and therefore should be handled for rate purposes in the same manner as firm services under the oatt  and failing to affirm the rate treatment that has been used for the legacy agreements for approximately years 
ipc cannot predict when the ferc will rule on the request for rehearing or the outcome of this matter 
on august   ipc filed its informational filing with the ferc that contains the annual update of the formula rate based on the test year 
the new rate included in the filing is per kw year  a decrease of per kw year  or percent 
the impact of this rate decrease on ipc s revenues will depend on transmission volume sold  which can be highly variable 
new rates were effective october  ipc has adjusted its rates to per kw year in compliance with the january  order 
transmission projects the transmission projects discussed below will be used both by wholesale transmission customers and to serve native load consistent with ipc s oatt 
these facilities will be subject to both the ferc and state public utility commission regulation and ratemaking policies 
gateway west project ipc and pacificorp are jointly exploring the gateway west project to build transmission lines between windstar  a substation located near douglas  wyoming and hemingway  a substation located in the vicinity of melba and murphy  idaho near boise 
the lines would be designed to increase electrical transmission capacity across southern idaho in response to increasing customer demand and growth  along with other transmission service requests 
ipc and pacificorp have a cost sharing agreement for expenses associated with the analysis work of the initial phases 
ipc s share of the initial phase of engineering  environmental review  permitting and rights of way is approximately million 
initial phases of the project could be completed by depending on the timing of rights of way  acquisition  siting and permitting  and construction sequencing 
if all initial phases are constructed  ipc estimates that its share of the project costs could range between million and million 
remaining phases of the project could be constructed as demand requires 
boardman hemingway line consistent with the irp and requirements and requests of other transmission customers  ipc is exploring alternatives for the construction of a kv line between southwestern idaho and the northwest 
the boardman hemingway line is expected to relieve existing congestion by increasing transmission capacity and improving reliability 
it will allow for the transfer of up to  mw of additional energy between idaho and the northwest 
the initial project phase estimate of million will be funded by ipc and includes the engineering  environmental review  permitting and rights of way 
cost estimates for the project including initial phase project estimate and construction costs of the line are approximately million 
ipc expects to seek partners for up to percent of the project when construction commences 
the line has a target in service date of june the existing transmission station at the boardman power plant in oregon will serve as the northwest terminal of the project 
the idaho terminal is the hemingway substation 
ipc and a number of other utilities with proposed regional transmission projects in the northwest have signed a letter agreeing to coordinate technical studies  which have begun 
the comprehensive progress report has been submitted to the wecc for review as part of the ratings process 
on august   ipc filed a notice of intent noi with the oregon department of energy to apply for a site certificate for the proposed line 
on october   ipc filed a project proposal with the northern tier transmission group cost allocation committee requesting approval of the allocation of costs and benefits for the project 
ipc does not expect any recommendation or approval by the nttg until the second half of other planning and project management activities are underway 
on october   ipc and portland general electric pge signed a memorandum of understanding mou as the basis for cooperation on the boardman hemingway line and pge s proposed southern crossing kv project 
the mou provides the two utilities an opportunity to integrate a portion of the proposed transmission lines if both projects move forward 
hemingway station construction of a new kv station named hemingway is expected to address growth  capacity and operating constraints 
the station was originally part of the gateway west project but the timing of this addition was accelerated to to help meet forecast deficits and improve reliability 
cost estimates for the project  including rights of way  permitting and substation interconnections  are approximately million 
hemingway hubbard transmission line as part of the hemingway station project  the hemingway hubbard transmission line is expected to provide power to the treasure valley in southwest idaho by the hemingway hubbard line will consist of a new kv double circuit transmission line and convert an existing kv transmission line to kv 
cost estimates for the project are approximately million 
public utility regulatory policies act of as mandated by the enactment of purpa and the adoption of avoided cost rates by the ipuc and the opuc  ipc has entered into contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
under these contracts  ipc is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside the ipc service territory 
for projects located outside the ipc service territory  ipc is required to purchase the output that ipc has the ability to receive at the facility s requested point of delivery on the ipc system 
the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts are fully recovered through base rates and the pca 
for ipuc jurisdictional contracts  projects that generate up to ten average mw of energy on a monthly basis are eligible for ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the opuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts is recovered through general rate case filings 
for opuc jurisdictional contracts  projects with a nameplate rating of up to ten mw of capacity are eligible for opuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and the opuc to estimate ipc s cost of developing additional generation resources 
if a purpa project does not qualify for published avoided costs  then ipc is required to negotiate the terms  prices and conditions with the developer of that project 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location and size and the benefits to the ipc system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
ongoing social and political pressure to increase the use of renewable energy is continuing to fuel expansion of renewable energy incentive programs at both the state and federal level 
in addition  it is expected that in early  the published avoided costs will be increased by both the ipuc and the opuc  which will result in the continuation of a favorable climate for purpa project development and may require ipc to enter into additional purpa agreements 
the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements may result in ipc acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices  thus increasing costs to its customers 
it is highly likely that the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements will add to ipc s surplus during certain times of the year  which could also increase costs to ipc s customers 
as of december   ipc had signed agreements to purchase energy from cspp facilities with contracts ranging from one to years 
seventy nine of these facilities  with a combined nameplate capacity of mw  were on line at the end of  the other facilities  with a combined nameplate capacity of mw  are projected to come on line in and the majority of the new facilities will be wind resources which will generate on an intermittent basis 
during  ipc purchased  mwh from these projects at a cost of million  resulting in a blended price of cents per kilowatt hour 
integrated resource plan ipc s integrated resource planning process forecasts ipc s load and resource situation for the next twenty years  analyzes potential supply side and demand side options and identifies near term and long term actions 
the irp is typically updated every two years  however with its acceptance of the irp  the ipuc requested that ipc align the submittal of its next irp with those submitted by other idaho utilities 
to comply with this request ipc provided an update on the status of the irp to both the ipuc and opuc in june an irp addendum was also filed with the opuc in february  which specifically addressed the need for the boardman to hemingway transmission project 
ipc is currently preparing the irp  which is expected to be completed in june during the time between resource plan filings  the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified in the irp allows for discussion and adjustment of the irp as warranted 
ipc continues to analyze and evaluate the resource plan and make periodic adjustments and corrections to reflect changes in technology  economic conditions  anticipated resource development and regulatory requirements 
each of the sections below provides an update of items identified in the resource planning process 
peaking resource the construction of a new simple cycle combustion turbine resource at the danskin plant near mountain home  idaho was completed in the first quarter of and the new generating unit was available during ipc s summer peak load period 
the combustion turbine provides approximately mw of capacity during the summer and up to mw in the winter 
geothermal rfps an rfp for geothermal powered generation was released in june ipc identified us geothermal  inc as the successful bidder in march based on a proposal to supply mw of geothermal energy 
in january  the ipuc approved a power purchase agreement for mw nameplate generation from the raft river geothermal power plant unit located in southern idaho 
this project began operating in october contract negotiations for the remaining mw continued throughout  however uncertainty in the development schedule and final cost made it impossible for the parties to agree on contract terms and conditions and the negotiation process came to a close in late in january  ipc released an rfp for to mw of geothermal energy 
proposals were due in march and as the evaluation process proceeded  all but one of the respondents withdrew their proposals 
ipc completed the rfp evaluation process on the remaining response  however it was not selected due to the economics and timing of the presented project 
while the results of the geothermal rfp processes have been disappointing  ipc is continuing to work with project developers capable of delivering energy to its service area 
ipc also continues to monitor developments in geothermal technology and is hopeful geothermal energy will become an economic and readily available resource for its customers 
baseload resource rfp in light of a decision to no longer pursue a conventional coal resource in as identified in the irp  ipc issued an rfp in for mw of dispatchable  physically delivered firm or unit contingent energy to be acquired under power purchase or tolling agreements 
a tolling agreement is an arrangement where one party owns  operates and maintains the generating facility and the other party provides fuel  pays capacity charges and receives the contracted output from the project including energy  capacity and ancillary services 
ipc prepared a self build proposal for a combined cycle combustion turbine  which serves as a benchmark resource and is competing in the rfp evaluation process 
proposals were received in october and are currently being evaluated 
this addition is expected to come online in to meet forecast deficits as described in the irp and the irp update 
ipc expects to request approval from the ipuc relating to the base load resource during the first quarter of  with an ipuc decision expected later this year 
combined heat and power chp rfp the irp included mw of chp coming on line in in april  ipc solicited its large industrial customers to determine the level of interest in chp development 
while the level of interest in chp development has been less than anticipated in the irp  ipc continues to work with parties to explore chp development opportunities 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects ipc  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
ipc is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hells canyon complex hcc and swan falls projects 
the relicensing costs are recorded and held in construction work in progress until new multi year licenses are issued by the ferc  at which time the charges will be transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to new licenses will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
relicensing costs of million and million for hcc and swan falls  respectively  were included in construction work in progress at december  hells canyon complex the most significant ongoing relicensing effort is the hcc  which provides approximately two thirds of ipc s hydroelectric generating capacity and percent of its total generating capacity 
in july  ipc filed an application for a new license in anticipation of the july expiration of the then existing license 
ipc is currently operating under an annual license issued by the ferc and expects to continue operating under annual licenses until the new license is issued 
consistent with the requirements of the national environmental policy act of  as amended nepa  the ferc staff issued on august   a final environmental impact statement eis for the hcc  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the project 
the purpose of the final eis is to inform the ferc  federal and state agencies  native american tribes and the public about the environmental effects of ipc s proposed operation of the hcc 
ipc is reviewing the final eis and expects to file comments with the ferc in in conjunction with the issuance of the final eis  on september   the ferc requested formal consultation under the endangered species act esa with the national marine fisheries service nmfs and the us fish and wildlife service usfws regarding the effect of hcc relicensing on several aquatic and terrestrial species listed as threatened under the esa 
however  formal consultation has not yet been initiated and nmfs and usfws continue to gather and consider information relative to the effect of relicensing on relevant species 
ipc continues to cooperate with the usfws  the nmfs and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns 
because the hcc is located on the snake river where it forms the border between idaho and oregon  ipc has filed water quality certification applications  required under section of the clean water act  with the states of idaho and oregon requesting that each state certify that any discharges from the project comply with applicable state water quality standards 
ipc continues to work with idaho and oregon to ensure that any discharges from the hcc will comply with the necessary state water quality standards so that appropriate water quality certifications can be issued for the project 
the ferc is expected to issue a license order for the hcc once the esa consultation and the section certification processes are completed 
swan falls project the license for the swan falls hydroelectric project expires in june on september   ipc submitted its draft license application to the ferc for public review and comment 
the draft contained project specific information and the results of environmental studies designed to determine project effects 
comments were received from the agencies and one native american tribe and on february   a joint meeting was held to address the comments and attempt to resolve areas of disagreement over study results and proposed mitigation measures 
on june   ipc filed a final license application with the ferc 
on july   in conformance with applicable regulations  the ferc issued a notice of application tendered for filing with the commission  soliciting additional study requests  and establishing procedural schedule for relicensing and a deadline for submission of final amendments 
pursuant to that notice  state and federal resource agencies  native american tribes or other interested parties were to file additional study requests with the ferc by august  additional study requests were filed by the shoshone bannock tribes and the usfws 
ipc filed responses to these requests on september and   respectively 
the ferc is still considering the requests from the shoshone bannock tribes and the usfws 
on october   ipc received a request from the ferc to provide clarification and additional information on the swan falls license application 
ipc will submit responses to this request by april  the ferc notified ipc on december   that the final license application had been officially accepted for filing 
shoshone falls expansion on august   ipc filed a license amendment application with the ferc  which would allow ipc to upgrade the shoshone falls project from mw to mw 
the license amendment is expected to be issued in in conjunction with the license amendment application  ipc has filed a water rights application which is currently being reviewed by the idaho department of water resources idwr 
ferc market based rate authority ipc has ferc approved market based rate authority  which permits ipc to sell electric energy at market based rates rather than being limited to cost based rates 
every three years  the ferc requires ipc to submit a triennial filing providing for a review of the conditions under which this market based rate authority was granted to ensure that the rates charged thereunder are just and reasonable 
on march   ipc submitted a filing to ferc showing that ipc continued to meet ferc s market based rate tests 
on june   ferc accepted ipc s filing  which allowed ipc to continue to maintain market based rate authority 
ipc s next market based rates triennial filing is due on june  legal and environmental issues western energy proceedings at the ferc throughout this report  the term western energy situation is used to refer to the california energy crisis that occurred during and  and the energy shortages  high prices and blackouts in the western united states 
high prices for electricity in california and in western wholesale markets during and caused numerous purchasers of electricity in those markets to initiate proceedings seeking refunds 
some of these proceedings the western energy proceedings remain pending before the ferc or on appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit ninth circuit 
there are pending in the ninth circuit approximately petitions for review of numerous ferc orders regarding the western energy situation  including the california refund proceeding  show cause orders with respect to contentions of market manipulation  and the pacific northwest proceedings 
decisions in these appeals may have implications with respect to other pending cases  including those to which idacorp  ipc or ie are parties 
idacorp  ipc and ie intend to vigorously defend their positions in these proceedings  but are unable to predict the outcome of these matters  except as otherwise stated below  or estimate the impact they may have on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
california refund this proceeding originated with an effort by agencies of the state of california and investor owned utilities in california to obtain refunds for a portion of the spot market sales from sellers of electricity into california markets from october   through june  in april  the ferc issued an order stating that it was establishing a price mitigation plan for sales in the california wholesale electricity market 
the ferc s order also included the potential for directing electricity sellers into california from october   through june   to refund portions of their spot market sales prices if the ferc determined that those prices were not just and reasonable 
in july  the ferc initiated the california refund proceeding including evidentiary hearings to determine the scope and methodology for determining refunds 
after evidentiary hearings  the ferc issued an order on refund liability on march   and later denied the numerous requests for rehearing 
the ferc also required the california independent system operator cal iso to make a compliance filing calculating refund amounts 
that compliance filing has been delayed on a number of occasions and has not yet been filed with the ferc 
ie and other parties petitioned the ninth circuit for review of the ferc s orders on california refunds 
as additional ferc orders have been issued  further petitions for review have been filed by potential refund payors  including ie  potential refund recipients and governmental agencies 
these cases have been consolidated before the ninth circuit 
since the initiation of these cases  the ninth circuit has convened a series of case management proceedings to organize these complex cases  while identifying and severing discrete cases that can proceed to briefing and decision and staying action on all of the other consolidated cases 
in its october decision in the first of the severed cases  the ninth circuit concluded that the ferc lacked refund authority over wholesale electrical energy sales made by governmental entities and non public utilities 
in its august decision in the second severed case  the ninth circuit ruled that all transactions that occurred within the california power exchange calpx and the cal iso markets were proper subjects of the refund proceeding  refused to expand the proceedings into the bilateral market  approved the refund effective date as october   and required the ferc to consider claims that some market participants had violated governing tariff obligations at an earlier date than the refund effective date and expanded the scope of the refund proceeding to include transactions within the calpx and cal iso markets outside the limited hour spot market and energy exchange transactions 
these latter aspects of the decision exposed sellers to increased claims for potential refunds 
in  the ferc established a framework for sellers wanting to demonstrate that the generally applicable ferc refund methodology interfered with the recovery of costs 
ie and ipc made such a cost filing but it was rejected by the ferc in march ie and ipc requested rehearing of that rejection and that request remains pending before the ferc 
ie and ipc are unable to predict how or when the ferc might rule on the request for rehearing  but its effect is confined to the minority of market participants that opted not to join the settlement described below 
accordingly  ie and ipc believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
on february   ie and ipc jointly filed with the california parties pacific gas electric company  san diego gas electric company  southern california edison company  the california public utilities commission  the california electricity oversight board  the california department of water resources and the california attorney general an offer of settlement at the ferc settling matters encompassed by the california refund proceeding  as well as other ferc proceedings and investigations relating to the western energy matters  including ie s and ipc s cost filing and refund obligation 
a number of other parties  representing a small minority of potential refund claims  chose to opt out of the settlement 
under the terms of the settlement  ie and ipc assigned million of the rights to accounts receivable from the cal iso and calpx to the california parties to pay into an escrow account for refunds to settling parties 
amounts from that escrow not used for settling parties and million of the remaining ie and ipc receivables that are to be retained by the calpx are available to fund  at least partially  payment of the claims of any non settling parties if they prevail in the remaining litigation of this matter 
any excess funds remaining at the end of the case are to be returned to ipc and ie 
approximately million of the remaining ie and ipc receivables was paid to ie and ipc under the settlement 
in addition  the california parties released ie and ipc from other claims stemming from the western energy market dysfunctions 
the ferc approved the offer of settlement on may  on october   the port of seattle petitioned the ninth circuit for review of the ferc orders approving the settlement 
on october   the ninth circuit lifted the stay as to the port of seattle s appeal along with two other cases and severed the three cases from the remainder of the consolidated cases 
on december   the ninth circuit filed an order dismissing the port of seattle petitions for review 
that dismissal order is now final 
market manipulation as part of the california refund proceeding discussed above and the pacific northwest refund proceeding discussed below  the ferc issued an order permitting discovery and the submission of evidence regarding market manipulation by sellers during the western energy situation 
on june   the ferc ordered more than entities that participated in the western wholesale power markets between january   and june   including ipc  to show cause why certain trading practices did not constitute gaming gaming or other forms of proscribed market behavior in concert with another party partnership in violation of the cal iso and calpx tariffs 
in  the ferc dismissed the partnership show cause proceeding against ipc 
the order dismissing ipc from the partnership proceedings was not the subject of rehearing requests and is now final 
later in  the ferc approved a settlement of the gaming proceeding without finding of wrongdoing by ipc 
the port of seattle was the only party to appeal the ferc orders approving the gaming settlement 
on december   the ninth circuit issued an order dismissing that appeal 
the dismissal order is now final 
the orders establishing the scope of the show cause proceedings are presently the subject of review petitions in the ninth circuit 
in addition to the two show cause orders  on june   the ferc also issued an order instituting an investigation of anomalous bidding behavior and practices in the western wholesale markets for the time period may   through october   to enable it to review evidence of economic withholding of generation 
ipc  along with more than other market participants  responded to the ferc data requests 
the ferc terminated its investigations as to ipc on may  although california government agencies and california investor owned utilities have appealed the ferc s termination of this investigation as to ipc and more than other market participants  the claims regarding the conduct encompassed by these investigations were released by these parties in the california refund settlement discussed above 
ie and ipc are unable to predict the outcome of these matters  but believe that the releases govern any potential claims that might arise and that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
pacific northwest refund on july   the ferc issued an order establishing a proceeding separate from the california refund proceeding to determine whether there may have been unjust and unreasonable charges for spot market sales in the pacific northwest during the period december   through june   because the spot market in the pacific northwest was affected by the dysfunction in the california market 
in late  a ferc administrative law judge concluded that the contracts at issue were governed by the substantially more strict mobile sierra standard of review rather than the just and reasonable standard  that the pacific northwest spot markets were competitive and that refunds should not be allowed 
after the judge s recommendation was issued  the ferc reopened the proceeding to allow the submission of additional evidence directly to the ferc related to alleged manipulation of the power market by market participants 
in  the ferc terminated the proceeding and declined to order refunds 
multiple parties filed petitions for review in the ninth circuit and in the ninth circuit issued an opinion  remanding to the ferc the orders that declined to require refunds 
the ninth circuit s opinion instructed the ferc to consider whether evidence of market manipulation would have altered the agency s conclusions about refunds and directed the ferc to include sales to the california department of water resources proceeding 
a number of parties have sought rehearing of the ninth circuit s decision 
ie and ipc intend to vigorously defend their positions in this proceeding  but are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the impact it may have on their consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
in separate western energy proceedings  the ninth circuit issued two decisions on december   regarding the ferc s decision not to require repricing of certain long term contracts 
those cases originated with individual complaints against specified sellers that did not include ie or ipc 
the ninth circuit remanded to the ferc for additional consideration the agency s use of restrictive standards of contract review 
in its decisions  the ninth circuit also questioned the validity of the ferc s administration of its market based rate regime 
on june   the us supreme court issued a decision in one of these cases  morgan stanley capital group inc v 
public utility district no 
of snohomish county no 
snohomish  and revisited and clarified the mobile sierra doctrine in the context of fixed rate  forward power contracts 
at issue was whether  and under what circumstances  the ferc could modify the rates in such contracts on the grounds that there was a dysfunctional market at the time the contracts were executed 
in its decision  the supreme court disagreed with many of the conclusions reached by the ninth circuit and upheld the application of the mobile sierra doctrine even in cases in which it is alleged that the markets were dysfunctional 
the supreme court nonetheless directed the return of the case to the ferc to i consider whether the challenged rates in the case constituted an excessive burden on consumers either at the time the contracts were formed or during the term of the contracts relative to the rates that could have been obtained after elimination of the dysfunctional market and ii clarify whether it found the evidence inadequate to support a claim that one of the parties to a contract under consideration engaged in unlawful market manipulation that altered the playing field for the particular contract negotiations that is  whether there was a causal connection between allegedly unlawful activity and the contract rate 
on november   the ninth circuit vacated its earlier decision and remanded the case to the ferc for further proceedings consistent with the supreme court s decision 
on december   the ferc issued its order on remand  establishing settlement proceedings and paper hearing procedures to supplement the record and permit it to respond to the questions specified by the supreme court 
this decision is expected to have general implications for contracts in the wholesale electric markets regulated by the ferc  and particular implications for forward power contracts in such markets 
the snohomish decision upholds the application of the mobile sierra doctrine to fixed rate  forward power contracts even in allegedly dysfunctional markets 
ipc and ie have asserted the mobile sierra doctrine in the pacific northwest proceeding  involving spot market contracts in an allegedly dysfunctional market 
idacorp  ipc and ie are unable to predict how the ferc will rule on snohomish on remand or how this decision will affect the outcome of the pacific northwest proceeding 
sierra club lawsuit bridger in february  the sierra club and the wyoming outdoor council filed a complaint against pacificorp in federal district court in cheyenne  wyoming alleging violations of air quality opacity standards at the jim bridger coal fired plant in sweetwater county  wyoming 
opacity is an indication of the amount of light obscured by the flue gas of a power plant 
a formal answer to the complaint was filed by pacificorp on april   in which pacificorp denied almost all of the allegations and asserted a number of affirmative defenses 
ipc is not a party to this proceeding but has a one third ownership interest in the plant 
pacificorp owns a two thirds interest in and is the operator of the plant 
the complaint alleges thousands of opacity permit limit violations by pacificorp and seeks a declaration that pacificorp has violated opacity limits  a permanent injunction ordering pacificorp to comply with such limits  civil penalties of up to  per day per violation  and reimbursement of the plaintiff s costs of litigation  including reasonable attorney fees 
discovery in the matter was completed on october  also in october  the plaintiffs and defendant filed cross motions for summary judgment on the alleged opacity compliance status of the plant 
the court has not yet ruled on these motions 
on july   the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting the court to schedule a date for oral argument on the pending motions for summary judgment 
on july   pacificorp filed an opposition to plaintiffs motion based on the court s order on initial pretrial conference  which stated that dispositive motions will be decided on the briefs without oral argument 
on november   the plaintiffs filed a motion to refer the pending motions for summary judgment to magistrate judge for recommendation decision 
on december   pacificorp filed an opposition to plaintiff s motion 
the court has yet to rule on either motion filed by the plaintiffs 
ipc continues to monitor the status of this matter but is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the impact it may have on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sierra club lawsuit boardman on september   sierra club and four other non profit corporations filed a complaint against portland general electric company pge in the us district court for the district of oregon alleging opacity permit limit violations at the boardman coal fired power plant located in morrow county  oregon 
the complaint also alleges violations of the clean air act  related federal regulations and the oregon state implementation plan relating to pge s construction and operation of the plant 
the complaint seeks a declaration that pge has violated opacity limits  a permanent injunction ordering pge to comply with such limits  injunctive relief requiring pge to remediate alleged environmental damage and ongoing impacts  civil penalties of up to  per day per violation and the plaintiffs cost of litigation  including reasonable attorney fees 
ipc is not a party to this proceeding but has a percent ownership interest in the boardman plant 
pge owns percent and is the operator of the plant 
on december   pge filed a motion to dismiss nine of the twelve claims asserted by plaintiffs in their complaint  alleging among other arguments that certain claims are barred by the statute of limitations or fail to state a claim upon which the court can grant relief 
plaintiffs response to the motion is due march   and pge s reply is due april  ipc intends to monitor the status of this matter but is unable to predict its outcome or what effect this matter may have on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
oregon trail heights fire on august   a fire ignited beneath an ipc distribution line in boise  idaho 
it was fanned by high winds and spread rapidly  resulting in one death  the destruction of homes and damage or alleged fire related losses to approximately others 
following the investigation  the boise fire department determined that the fire was linked to a piece of line hardware on one of ipc s distribution poles and that high winds contributed to the fire and its resultant damage 
ipc has received notice of claims from a number of the homeowners and their insurers and is continuing its investigation of these claims 
ipc is insured up to policy limits against liability for claims in excess of its self insured retention 
ipc has accrued a reserve for any loss that is probable and reasonably estimable  including insurance deductibles  and believes this matter will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other legal proceedings from time to time idacorp and ipc are parties to legal claims  actions and complaints in addition to those discussed above and in note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements 
although they will vigorously defend against them  they are unable to predict with certainty whether or not they will ultimately be successful 
however  based on the companies evaluation  they believe that the resolution of these matters  taking into account existing reserves  will not have a material adverse effect on idacorp s or ipc s consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental issues idaho water management issues since idaho has experienced below normal precipitation and stream flows which have exacerbated a developing water shortage in idaho  manifested by a number of water issues including declining snake river base flows and declining levels in the eastern snake plain aquifer espa  a large underground aquifer that has been estimated to hold between million acre feet maf of water 
these issues are of interest to ipc because of their potential impacts on generation at ipc s hydroelectric projects 
as a result of declines in river flows  in several surface water users filed delivery calls with the idwr  demanding that it manage ground water withdrawals pursuant to the prior appropriation doctrine of first in time is first in right and curtail junior ground water rights that are depleting the aquifer and affecting flows to senior surface water rights 
these delivery calls have resulted in several administrative actions before the idwr to enforce senior water rights as well as judicial actions before the state court challenging the constitutionality of state regulations used by the idwr to conjunctively administer ground and surface water rights 
because ipc holds water rights that are dependent on the snake river  spring flows and the overall condition of the espa  ipc continues to monitor and participate in these actions  as necessary  to protect its water rights 
one such action relates to the milner hydroelectric project which is owned by the north side canal company nscc and the twin falls canal company tfcc 
in  ipc entered into a contract with the owners relating to the construction and operation of a power plant at milner dam 
to facilitate the rehabilitation of the milner dam  ipc and nscc tfcc jointly filed for  and were issued  a ferc license for a hydroelectric project at the dam 
ipc constructed and operates the project  and participated in the financing of the dam rehabilitation 
nscc and tfcc filed an application for a water right for the project and were issued an approved water right permit by the idwr in the permit contained a condition subordinating the water right to all consumptive beneficial uses of water  other than hydropower and groundwater recharge 
since the issuance of the permit  the nscc and tfcc have delivered water to and ipc has operated the milner project under the ferc license 
on october   the idwr issued a water right license for the project that changed the subordination condition in the permit by deleting the reference to groundwater recharge  thereby subordinating the water right to groundwater recharge 
on november   nscc and tfcc filed a petition for hearing with idwr contesting the change in the subordination condition 
the idwr has appointed a hearing officer and several parties have petitioned to intervene in the case 
a hearing date has not been set on the petition 
ipc is monitoring but is unable to predict the outcome of the administrative action 
ipc  together with other interested water users and state interests  also continues to explore and encourage the development of a long term management plan that will protect the espa and the snake river from further depletion 
on february   the idaho water resource board iwrb presented the framework for an espa management plan to the idaho legislature recommending the development of a comprehensive aquifer management plan camp 
the proposed goal of the camp is to sustain the economic viability and social and environmental health of the espa by adaptively managing a balance between water use and supplies 
through house concurrent resolution and house bill  the idaho legislature appropriated funds and directed the iwrb to proceed with the development of the camp 
pursuant to the iwrb recommendation in the camp framework  an advisory committee has been established to make recommendations to the iwrb on the development of the camp 
ipc sits on the camp advisory committee 
in december  the camp advisory committee submitted a draft camp to the iwrb for consideration 
the iwrb took public comments on the draft camp and by resolution dated january  adopted the camp and submitted it to the idaho legislature for approval 
ipc submitted comments to the iwrb supporting the camp 
if the legislature approves and funds implementation of the camp  ipc will serve on the camp implementation committee and assist with the development and implementation of camp projects that provide benefits to snake river water quality and flows through the maintenance and enhancement of aquifer and spring levels 
ipc is also engaged in the snake river basin adjudication srba  a general stream adjudication  commenced in  to define the nature and extent of water rights in the snake river basin in idaho  including the water rights of ipc 
the initiation of the srba resulted from the swan falls agreement  an agreement entered into by ipc and the governor and attorney general of idaho in october to resolve litigation relating to ipc s water rights at its swan falls project 
ipc has filed claims to its water rights for hydropower and other uses in the srba 
other water users in the basin have also filed claims to water rights 
parties to the srba may file objections to water right claims that adversely affect or injure their claimed water rights and the idaho district court for the fifth judicial district  which has jurisdiction over srba matters  then adjudicates the claims and objections and enters a decree defining a party s water rights 
ipc has filed claims for all of its hydropower water rights in the srba  is actively protecting those water rights  and is objecting to claims that may potentially injure or affect those water rights 
one such claim involves a notice of claim of ownership filed on december   by the state of idaho  for a portion of the water rights held by ipc that are subject to the swan falls agreement 
on may   in order to protect its claims and the availability of water for power purposes at its facilities  and in response to the claim of ownership filed by the state of idaho  ipc filed a complaint and petition for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the status and nature of ipc s water rights and the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties under the swan falls agreement 
the complaint was filed in the idaho district court for the fifth judicial district  the court with jurisdiction over the srba  against the state of idaho  the governor  the attorney general  the idwr and the director of the idwr 
in conjunction with the filing of the complaint and petition  ipc filed motions with the court to stay all pending proceedings involving the water rights of ipc and to consolidate those proceedings into a single action where all issues relating to the swan falls agreement can be determined 
ipc alleged in the complaint  among other things  that contrary to the parties belief at the time the swan falls agreement was entered into in  the snake river basin above swan falls was over appropriated and as a consequence there was not in  and there currently is not  water available for new upstream uses over and above the minimum flows established by the swan falls agreement  that because of this mutual mistake of fact relating to the over appropriation of the basin  the swan falls agreement should be reformed  that the state s december   claim of ownership to ipc s water rights should be denied  and that the swan falls agreement did not subordinate ipc s water rights to aquifer recharge 
on april   the court issued a memorandum decision and order on cross motions for summary judgment upholding the swan falls agreement 
under the swan falls agreement  water rights in excess of the minimum flows established by the agreement are held in trust by the state of idaho for the use and benefit of ipc and the people of the state of idaho 
water above these minimum flows is available for subsequent consumptive beneficial uses that are approved in accordance with state law 
the court further held that to the extent that the state is not meeting the minimum flows or it is anticipated that the minimum flows will not be met  ipc s water rights that are held in trust are not available for subsequent appropriations and that any appropriations already in place may be subject to curtailment in order to meet the minimum flows 
the court found that it was not necessary to address the issue of mutual mistake of fact relating to the over appropriation of the basin because it found that it was water rights that were the subject of the trust arrangement and not the water itself 
the court also stated that issues relating to water availability relate to the administration of water rights and should be addressed  as necessary  in an administrative action before the idwr 
the court did not decide the issue of whether the swan falls agreement subordinated ipc s water rights to groundwater recharge 
the state of idaho and ipc filed summary judgment motions on the recharge issue and completed briefing on the issue 
the court held a hearing on december  on the summary judgment motions 
after argument  the court took the matter under advisement 
ipc is unable to predict how the court will rule on the issue of whether the swan falls agreement subordinated ipc s water rights to groundwater recharge 
based upon recent developments  however  resolution of that issue is not expected to have a significant effect on the availability of water to ipc s hydropower facilities 
ipc is cooperating with the state of idaho and other water users through an advisory committee in the development of the camp to protect and enhance water levels in the espa and the connected snake river 
while many camp committee members had early expectations that groundwater recharge would be a significant component of the plan and believe that groundwater recharge is a very high priority issue  further study and review has revealed that significant groundwater recharge is not feasible due to the complex hydrogeology of the espa  the lack of infrastructure  and the requirement of compliance with water quality and other environmental standards 
ipc is currently engaged in a three to five year pilot study  in cooperation with idwr and various water users  to determine the temporal and spatial impacts and or benefits of recharging a maximum of  acre feet of water downstream of american falls reservoir on the espa and the snake river 
ipc has also filed an action in federal court against the united states bureau of reclamation to enforce a contract right for delivery of water to its hydropower projects on the snake river 
in  ipc and the united states entered into a contract that facilitated the development of the american falls reservoir by the united states on the snake river in southeast idaho 
this contract entitles ipc to  acre feet of primary storage capacity in the reservoir and  acre feet of secondary storage that was to be available to ipc between october of any year and june of the following year as necessary to maintain specified flows at ipc s twin falls power plant below milner dam 
ipc believes that the united states has failed to deliver this secondary storage  at the specified flows  since as a result  ipc filed an action in the us district court of federal claims in washington  dc on october  to recover damages from the united states for the lost generation resulting from the reduced flows 
on september   ipc filed an amended complaint in which ipc seeks  in addition to damages for breach of the contract  a prospective declaration of contractual rights so as to prevent the united states from continued failure to fulfill its contractual and fiduciary duties to ipc 
on october   the court set a discovery schedule requiring that discovery be completed and pre trial motions filed by october  the court will then set the matter for trial 
ipc is unable to predict the outcome of this action 
air quality issues ipc owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants and co owns three coal fired power plants that are subject to air quality regulation 
the natural gas fired plants  danskin and bennett mountain  are located in idaho 
the coal fired plants are jim bridger percent interest located in wyoming  boardman ten percent interest located in oregon  and valmy percent interest located in nevada 
the clean air act establishes controls on the emissions from stationary sources like those owned by ipc 
the environmental protection agency epa adopts many of the standards and regulations under the clean air act  while states have the primary responsibility for implementation and administration of these air quality programs 
ipc continues to actively monitor  evaluate and work on air quality issues pertaining to the clean air mercury rule camr  possible legislative amendment of the clean air act  emerging greenhouse gas and climate change programs at the federal  regional and state levels  new source review nsr permitting  national ambient air quality standards naaqs  and regional haze best available retrofit technology rh bart 
installation of low nitrogen oxide nox burner technology and over fired upgrades has been completed at the valmy plant 
installation of low nox burners on all four coal fired units at the jim bridger plant is in progress 
sulfur dioxide so scrubber upgrade projects also have started on unit four at the jim bridger plant and scrubber upgrade projects on the other three units at the plant will occur over the next three years 
mercury continuous emission monitoring systems mercury cems have been installed on all of the coal fired units at the jim bridger  boardman and valmy plants and tests to confirm the accuracy of the data being collected are currently underway 
national ambient air quality standards in july  the epa adopted new naaqs for ozone hour ozone standard and fine particulate matter of less than micrometers in diameter pm standard 
regulations promulgated by the epa to implement these naaqs have been challenged and portions have been remanded back to the epa for reconsideration 
the epa and state efforts to implement the naaqs adopted in are ongoing 
for example  on may   the epa issued a final rule implementing the nsr program for emissions of pm this rule establishes the framework for requiring preconstruction permit review of pm emissions from new or modified major stationary sources such as the power plants owned by ipc 
all of the counties in idaho  oregon  nevada and wyoming where ipc s power plants operate currently are designated as meeting attainment with hour ozone and pm standards adopted by the epa in in december  the epa revised the naaqs for pm this new standard has been challenged by a number of groups in the us court of appeals for the dc circuit 
on december   the epa designated areas as attainment  nonattainment and unclassifiable for the revised pm naaqs 
all of the counties in idaho  nevada  oregon and wyoming where ipc s power plants operate were designated as meeting attainment with the revised pm naaqs 
the impact of the new standard will not be known until the judicial appeals are completed and the associated regulatory programs are promulgated and implemented 
in march  the epa promulgated a final regulation which revised the hour ozone naaqs 
for the primary health based standard  the epa lowered the standard from parts per million ppm to ppm 
under the epa s final rule  states must make recommendations to the epa by march for areas to be designated attainment  nonattainment and unclassifiable 
several states  environmental organizations and private parties have challenged the epa s regulation 
the impact of the revised standard will not be known until data is collected  analyzed  and released to the public  the judicial appeals are completed and the associated regulatory programs are promulgated and implemented 
the epa is expected to make final air quality designations by march clean air mercury rule the camr  issued by the epa on march   limits mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and creates a market based cap and trade program that will permanently cap utility mercury emissions 
on february   the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the camr and remanded it back to the epa for reconsideration consistent with the court s interpretation of the clean air act 
the epa and an industry trade association subsequently filed requests with the us supreme court to review the dc circuit s decision 
on february   the epa filed a motion with the court to withdraw its request and on february   the court denied the industry trade association s request 
it is possible that the decision to remand the camr back to the epa for reconsideration could result in the epa developing maximum achievable control technology standards for mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
it also is possible that the court s decision could result in changes to the mercury reductions required by the states in which ipc has partial ownership interests in coal fired power plants 
in  the state of oregon adopted a mercury rule requiring boardman to reduce mercury emissions by percent or meet an emission rate of lbs trillion btu by july the state is now considering allowing up to a two year extension 
ipc continues to monitor wyoming and nevada actions on mercury emissions 
ipc is unable to predict at this time what actions the epa or the other states may take in response to the court s decision or any resulting impacts to ipc 
clean air interstate rule cair the cair  issued by the epa on march   establishes a permanent cap on emissions of nox and so primarily from power plants in eastern states and the district of columbia 
while the cair does not apply to any of the power plants owned by ipc  it is an important rule for the electric utility industry because of its broad applicability and its close relation to the camr 
the cair was subjected to legal challenges by a number of states  industry  and environmental groups 
on july   the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the cair 
on december   the us court of appeals for the us circuit issued an order reinstating the cair for a temporary period of time until the epa can address the legal defects identified in the court s july  decision 
while reinstating the cair will temporarily allow the cair to remain in effect  the full impacts of this court ruling will not be fully understood until any future appeals are resolved or until such time as the epa and or individual states respond to the court s ruling 
regional haze best available retrofit technology in accordance with federal regional haze rules  the wyoming department of environmental quality wdeq and the oregon department of environmental quality odeq are conducting an assessment of emission sources pursuant to a rh bart process 
coal fired utility boilers are subject to rh bart if they were built between and and affect any class i areas 
this includes all four units at the jim bridger plant and the boardman plant 
the two units at the valmy plant were constructed after and are not subject to the federal regional haze rule 
the states are also working on reasonable progress towards a long term strategy to reduce regional haze in class i areas to natural conditions by the year pacificorp submitted the rh bart application for the jim bridger plant in january the wdeq is still evaluating the application and will request public comment 
if there are no appeals to the application  the wdeq will prepare a state implementation plan sip to present to the wyoming environmental quality council for approval and submittal to the epa 
the plant is already in the process of installing low nox burners and scrubber upgrades that are proposed in the application 
over the next four years  ipc s share of these upgrade expenditures are currently estimated at million  with a total upgrade expenditures estimated at million 
ipc and pacificorp have been meeting with the wdeq to discuss the potential for additional rh bart and reasonable progress requirements for the jim bridger plant 
it is possible that additional capital expenditures would be required to satisfy these additional requirements  however  ipc is not able to quantify these expenditures at this time 
on august   the odeq issued a draft rh bart proposal for the boardman plant that  if adopted  would require the installation of significant emission controls beginning in the pollution control requirements proposed by the odeq for rh bart and the long term strategy are estimated to cost approximately million ipc share 
ipc s share of the cost to comply with the proposal would be approximately million by with an additional million by installation of this pollution control equipment would require extended maintenance outages 
on december   pge proposed amendments to the odeq proposal  including an alternative of decommissioning the coal fired unit at the boardman plant subject to rh bart by the end of in lieu of installing so emissions controls by pge also proposed including an alternative that would allow it to decommission the same unit in in lieu of installing additional nox emission controls by the odeq is expected to finalize its rh bart determination in april pge has indicated that the costs required pursuant to rh bart  together with any taxes  emission fees and other costs that may be imposed under future laws related to climate change could require an investment in excess of what the plant can economically support 
greenhouse gases ipc continues to monitor and evaluate national  regional  or state greenhouse gas ghg proposals and programs as well as judicial decisions that would affect electric utilities 
at the federal level  numerous ghg bills were introduced in the us senate and house of representatives during  including the climate security act of s 
 which was debated on the senate floor in june but not voted on 
the new administration has requested the development of new federal proposals by congress and the epa that could lead to the adoption of a mandatory program to reduce ghg emissions through  for example  an economy wide cap and trade program  a carbon tax or a combination of both 
debate continues on the direction  scope and timing of us policy on the regulation of ghg emissions 
the states of arizona  california  montana  new mexico  oregon  utah and washington  along with the provinces of british columbia  manitoba  ontario and quebec  canada  have formed the western regional climate action initiative wci 
on august   the wci partners released their regional goal to collectively reduce ghgs percent below levels by the wci partners have agreed to design a regional market based multi sector mechanism to help achieve the goal 
on september   the wci issued its design recommendations to reduce ghg emissions from the electricity generating industry 
the recommendations by the wci include a cap and trade program for the electricity generating industry which would apply to in state electricity generators and the first jurisdictional deliverer of electricity into a wci partner state 
the states of idaho  nevada and wyoming have not joined the wci 
it is possible that these states in which ipc owns fossil fuel fired electricity generation facilities or sells electricity could join the wci in the future 
oregon passed the global warming integration act in june  which among other things  established the oregon global warming commission and state wide ghg emission reduction goals 
on may   washington enacted legislation creating ghg emission reduction and clean energy goals 
emission performance standards affecting electric utility contracts and power plant projects are included 
on september   california s governor signed into law the global warming solutions act of ab  which established ghg reduction goals and a framework for achieving these goals 
on december   the california air resources board carb approved a scoping plan that provides a framework for implementing a cap and trade program for the electricity generating sector pursuant to ab the scoping plan subjects the electricity generating sector  including electricity imports from out of state generation  to an emissions cap beginning in based on the requirements of ab  regulations to implement that cap and trade program need to be developed by january  other regional and state ghg initiatives appear likely  although the states of idaho  nevada  and wyoming have not adopted ghg legislation 
in april  the us supreme court issued its decision in massachusetts v 
environmental protection agency  a case involving the epa s authority to regulate carbon dioxide co 
emissions from motor vehicles under the clean air act 
the court held that  with respect to mobile sources  the epa has authority under the clean air act to regulate co as a pollutant and that the epa has a duty to determine whether co emissions contribute to climate change or provide some reasonable explanation why it will not exercise its authority 
the decision  combined with stimulus from state  regional and federal legislative and regulatory initiatives  judicial decisions and other factors may lead to a determination by the epa to regulate co emissions from stationary sources  including electricity generators 
on march   the epa announced that it would issue an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking anpr to solicit public input on whether ghg emissions should be regulated from both mobile and stationary sources under the clean air act 
on june   the us court of appeals for the dc circuit denied the request of attorneys general from states to require the epa to rule within days on whether co 

is a danger to public health or welfare and  therefore  subject to regulation under the clean air act 
on july   the epa released its anpr inviting public comment on the benefits and ramifications of regulating ghgs under the clean air act 
environmental groups contend that co is subject to regulation under the clean air act and that preconstruction permitting requirements must be applied to co emissions prior to the construction of new power plants or the modification of existing power plants 
specifically  in in re deseret power electric cooperative  psd appeal no 
 the sierra club argued to the epa s environmental appeals board eab that best available control technology bact is required to reduce co emissions from coal fired power plants prior to the issuance of a preconstruction permit under the clean air act s nsr program 
on november  the eab remanded the appeal back to epa region to reconsider whether a co bact limit should be imposed in the permit 
epa region has not yet responded to the eab s remand 
on december   however  the epa administrator issued an interpretive memorandum stating that co is not a regulated pollutant under the epa s nsr program 
environmental groups filed a request with the epa to reconsider the conclusions reached in the december  interpretive memorandum  which was granted by the epa on february  information about idacorp s co emissions is included in the report benchmarking air emissions of the largest electric power producers in the united states this report was released by the ceres investor coalition  the natural resources defense council  the public service enterprise group inc and pg e corporation in may the report lists idacorp s co emissions at lbs mwh  as compared to the reported average for the largest power producers of  lbs mwh 
ipc s co emissions on an lbs mwh basis fluctuate with the amount of hydroelectric generation 
in  ipc s co emissions from ipc s electric power generation facilities were approximately million tons  or  lbs mwh adjusted to reflect ipc s partial ownership in the jim bridger  boardman and valmy facilities 
the epa is developing a mandatory ghg reporting rule that would require reporting of ghg emissions from large sources 
the emission information collected would be used by the epa to develop comprehensive and accurate data relevant to future climate policy decisions  including potential future regulation of ghg emissions 
the final reporting rule is scheduled to be finalized by june ipc will continue to monitor and evaluate federal  regional or state ghg programs and proposals and judicial and administrative decisions that would affect electric utilities as these programs could increase ipc s capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
at this time  however  ipc is unable to estimate the costs of compliance with potential national  regional or state ghg emissions reduction legislation  regulations or initiatives because these programs and proposals are in the early stages of development and any final program or programs  if adopted  could vary from current proposals 
the majority of current national  regional and state initiatives regarding ghg emissions contemplate market based compliance programs 
a determination by the epa to regulate ghg emissions under the clean air act could result in ghg emission limits on stationary sources that do not provide market based compliance options such as cap and trade programs or emission offsets 
such a program could raise uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels  specifically coal as an economical energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities because new technologies for reducing co emissions from coal  including carbon capture and storage  are still in the development stage and are not yet proven 
the actual impact of future regulation of ghg emissions on ipc s financial performance will depend on a number of factors  including but not limited to the geographic scope of any legislation or regulation eg  federal  regional  state  the enactment date of the legislation or regulation and the compliance deadlines  the type of any legislation or regulation eg  cap and trade  carbon tax  ghg emission limits  the level of ghg reductions required and the year selected as a baseline for determining the amount or percentage of mandated ghg reductions  the extent to which market based compliance options are available  the extent to which a facility would be entitled to receive ghg emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the price and availability of offsets in the secondary market and the availability and cost of carbon control technology 
as part of ipc s resource planning protocol  the irp process considers potential ghg emissions regulation and other environmental factors when evaluating potential portfolios 
the irp included a risk analysis of the costs associated with the regulation of co emissions by analyzing low  expected and high cases of  and respectively  per ton of co emitted 
environmental impacts have been and will continue to be integral components of ipc s resource decisions 
due to escalating construction costs  potential permitting issues  and continued uncertainty surrounding future ghg laws and regulations  ipc has determined that coal fired generation is not the best technology to meet its resource needs in ipc has shifted its focus to the development of a combined cycle natural gas fired resource located closer to its load center in southern idaho 
also  ipc added mw of contracted wind generation in december bringing ipc s total to mw 
another mw of contracted wind generation is under construction 
ipc has added mw of geothermal generation 
additional wind and geothermal generation is anticipated through cspp and rfp driven contracts 
climate change ipc s substantial hydroelectric generation resources neither burn nor consume fossil fuels to produce electric energy to meet the needs of its customers 
given the debate concerning climate change  consensus is growing that broad steps should be taken in all sectors of the nation s economy to carefully consider ways of limiting and or reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change impacts while still providing necessary services in a cost effective manner 
ipc intends to continue to add renewable resources to its resource portfolio and will continue to monitor the climate change debate  current climate change research  and recently enacted as well as proposed legislation to identify the potential impacts of global climate change on all aspects of its business 
long term climate change could significantly affect ipc s business in a variety of ways  including but not limited to  the following a changes in temperature  precipitation and snow pack conditions could affect customer demand and the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation and extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages  and maintenance costs  and b legislative and or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plans and operations in various ways including placing restrictions on the construction of new generation resources  the expansion of existing resources  or the operation of generation resources in general 
ipc cannot  however  quantify the potential impact of climate change on its business at this time 
renewable portfolio standards ipc s operations in oregon will be required to comply with a ten percent renewable energy portfolio standard beginning in the new federal administration has called on congress to adopt a federal renewable energy portfolio standard and it is possible that idaho and other states in which ipc operates or sells power could adopt renewable energy portfolio standards in the future 
new state or federal renewable energy portfolio standards could increase capital expenditures and operating costs and reduce earnings and cash flows 
new source review epa region began reviewing pacificorp operations  including the jim bridger plant of which ipc is a one third owner for compliance with nsr and new source performance standards nsps through a clean air act section information request sent in may pacificorp completed its phased response to the section request in february with the submission of documents to the epa relating to historical activities at bridger and other pacificorp power plants 
a number of utilities that have also been the subject of epa nsr information requests have engaged in settlement negotiations with the epa to resolve allegations of nsr and nsps noncompliance 
prior settlements reached between the epa and utility companies around the country to resolve these issues have resulted in commitments by the utility companies to install additional pollution control equipment and to pay civil penalties 
negotiations are continuing between the epa and pacificorp on this issue 
ipc cannot predict the outcome of this matter at this time 
endangered species in december  the usfws listed several species of fish and five species of snails living within ipc s operating area as threatened or endangered species under the endangered species act 
ipc continues to review and analyze the effect such designation has on its operations and is cooperating with governmental agencies to resolve issues related to these species 
on september   the species of snail that had been listed as the idaho springsnail was delisted by the usfws 
the delisting decision was based on recent studies that indicated the species was synonymous with another common species 
on december   ipc and the governor of idaho submitted a petition to the usfws to de list the threatened bliss rapids snail 
the petition was supported with data collected by ipc over the past years 
the snail  which lives throughout the middle snake river  springs  and tributaries between niagara springs and king hill  was listed as threatened under the endangered species act in as of december   no decision on the delisting petition had been issued by the usfws 
pursuant to ferc license  ipc owns and finances the operation of anadromous fish hatcheries and related facilities to mitigate the effects of its hydroelectric dams on fish populations 
in connection with its fish facilities  ipc sponsors ongoing programs for the control of fish disease  improvement of fish production  and evaluation of hatchery performance 
ipc s anadromous fish facilities at hells canyon  oxbow  rapid river  pahsimeroi and niagara springs continue to be operated by the idaho department of fish and game 
at december   the investment in these facilities was million and the annual cost of operation was million 
other matters southwest intertie project swip on march   great basin transmission  llc great basin exercised its option to purchase the southern portion of the southwest intertie project swip  which consists principally of a federal permit for a specific transmission corridor in nevada and idaho and private rights of way in idaho 
this sale closed during the second quarter of  and resulted in a net pre tax gain of approximately million 
on december   ipc and great basin reached an agreement on the sale of the northern portion of the swip  which is expected to close in the first quarter of and result in a pre tax gain of million 
adopted accounting pronouncements sfas idacorp and ipc partially adopted the provisions of sfas  fair value measurements sfas on january  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
fasb staff position fsp fas delayed the implementation of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the delay is intended to allow the fasb and constituents additional time to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of sfas in accordance with fsp fas  ipc did not apply the provisions of sfas to asset retirement obligations 
on october   the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas  in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
this fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the adoption of sfas and its related pronouncements did not have a material effect on idacorp s or ipc s consolidated financial statements 
sfas idacorp and ipc adopted the provisions of sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement sfas on january  sfas permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
most of the provisions in sfas are elective  however  the amendment to sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
idacorp and ipc did not elect the fair value option for any existing eligible items  thus the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on idacorp s or ipc s consolidated financial statements 
fsp fin idacorp and ipc adopted fasb staff position fin fsp fin  amendment of fasb interpretation no 
fin on january  fsp fin modifies fin  offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts  and permits reporting entities to offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments that have been offset under a master netting arrangement 
idacorp and ipc have elected to offset these positions  which resulted in an immaterial net decrease to total assets and liabilities at december  eitf issue no 
idacorp and ipc adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for income tax benefits of dividends on share based payment awards eitf on january  eitf requires income tax benefits from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to retained earnings and are paid to employees for equity classified awards and outstanding equity share options to be recognized as an increase in additional paid in capital and to be included in the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb potential future tax deficiencies on share based payment awards 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on idacorp s or ipc s consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements see note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
inflation idacorp and ipc believe that inflation has caused and may continue to cause increases in certain operating expenses and the replacement of assets at higher costs 
inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operations and maintenance and capital expenditures 
while inflation has not had a significant impact on idacorp s or ipc s operations  increases in utility expenses due to inflation could have an adverse effect on earnings because of the need to obtain regulatory approval to recover such increased expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and ipc manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had million and million  respectively  in net floating rate debt 
assuming no change in financial structure for either company  if variable interest rates were one percentage point higher than the rates in effect on december   interest rate expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had outstanding fixed rate debt of  million and  million  respectively  and the fair market value of this debt was  million and million  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose the companies to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for idacorp and ipc if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk utility ipc s exposure to changes in commodity price is related to its ongoing utility operations producing electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers 
the weather is a major uncontrollable factor affecting the local and regional demand for electricity and the availability and price of production 
the objective of ipc s energy purchase and sale activity is to meet the demand of retail electric customers  maintain appropriate physical reserves to ensure reliability  and make economic use of temporary surpluses that may develop 
ipc s exposure to commodity price risk is largely offset by the previously discussed pca mechanism 
ipc has adopted a risk management program designed to reduce exposure to power supply cost related uncertainty  further mitigating commodity price risk 
this program has been reviewed and accepted by the ipuc 
ipc s energy risk management policy the policy describes a collaborative process with customers and regulators via a committee called the customer advisory group cag 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of selected ipc officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
the rmc is responsible for communicating the status of risk management activities to the ipc board of directors  and to the cag 
the policy requires monitoring monthly volumetric electricity position and total monthly dollar net power supply cost exposure on a rolling month forward view 
the power supply business unit produces and evaluates projections of the operating plan and orders risk mitigating actions dictated by the limits stated in the policy 
the rmc evaluates the actions initiated by power supply for consistency and compliance with the policy 
ipc representatives meet with the cag at least annually to assess effectiveness of the limits 
changes to the limits can be endorsed by the cag and referred to the board of directors for approval 
the primary tools for risk mitigation are physical and financial forward power transactions and fueling alternatives for utility owned generation resources 
credit risk utility ipc is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy or complete financial settlement for market activities 
ipc mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  reporting  using appropriate contractual arrangements and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits is maintained 
the use of performance assurance collateral in the form of cash  letters of credit  or guarantees is common industry practice 
ipc maintains margin agreements that allow performance assurance collateral to be requested and or posted with certain counterparties 
as of december   ipc had posted approximately million of assurance collateral 
should ipc experience a reduction in its credit rating on ipc s unsecured debt to below investment grade  ipc could be subject to additional requests by its wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral 
based upon ipc s current energy and fuel portfolio and current market conditions as of december   the approximate amount of additional collateral that could be requested upon a downgrade is approximately million 
ipc actively monitors the portfolio exposure and the potential exposure to additional requests for performance assurance collateral calls  through sensitivity analysis  to minimize capital requirements 
credit risk for ipc s retail customers is managed by credit and collection policies that are governed by rules issued by the ipuc 
ipc is obligated to provide service to all electric customers within its service area 
ipc records a provision for uncollectible accounts  based upon historical experience  to provide for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers 
ipc will continue to monitor the impact of the current economic conditions on nonpayment from customers and will make any necessary adjustments to its provision for uncollectible accounts 
idaho administrative code for utility customer relations rules prohibits ipc from terminating electric service during the months of december through february to any residential customer who declares that he or she is unable to pay in full for utility service and whose household includes children  elderly or infirm persons 
ipc s provision for uncollectible accounts could be affected by changes in future prices as well as changes in ipuc regulations 
equity price risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of ipc and other equity investments at ipc 
as a result of recent market declines  the fair value of the pension plan s assets has decreased resulting in an increase in future amounts required to be contributed to the plan 
based on current laws  ipc estimates that the minimum contribution to ipc s pension plan for  which may be made as late as  will be million 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities
