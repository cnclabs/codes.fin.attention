we employ over  employees worldwide and operate in the united states  canada  china  mexico  the philippines and the united kingdom 
from a geographic perspective  approximately of our total revenue was from north america for the fiscal year ended november  we purchase it systems  peripherals  system components  packaged software and networking equipment from oem suppliers such as hewlett packard company  or hp  panasonic  lenovo and seagate  and sell them to our reseller customers 
we perform the same function for our purchases of licensed software products 
our reseller customers include value added resellers  or vars  corporate resellers  government resellers  system integrators  direct marketers and retailers 
our largest oem supplier  hp  accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended november  the it distribution and contract assembly industries in which we operate are characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
as well  the market for it products and services is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide 
our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for it products and services 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products  overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it industry and increased price based competition 
revenue and cost of revenue we derive our revenue primarily through the distribution of it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  assembly services and gbs 
for products  we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
we review and adjust these provisions periodically 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we provide our gbs services to our customers under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service we offer 
our agreements are usually short term in nature  subject to early termination by our customers or us for any reason  typically with to days notice 
revenue is recognized as services are performed and if collection is reasonably assured 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue in fiscal years  or approximately   and of our total revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively  was derived from the sale of hp products 
the market for it products is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
our overall business is also highly competitive on the basis of price 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product and service we provide to our customers 
from 
table of contents time to time  we also participate in the incentive and rebate programs of our oem suppliers 
these programs are important determinants of the final sales price we charge to our reseller customers 
to mitigate the risk of declining prices and obsolescence of our distribution inventory  our oem suppliers generally offer us limited price protection and return rights for products that are marked down or discontinued by them 
we carefully manage our inventory to maximize the benefit to us of these supplier provided protections 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue is the purchase price we pay our oem suppliers for the products we sell  net of any rebates and purchase discounts received from our oem suppliers 
cost of product distribution revenue also consists of provisions for inventory losses and write downs  and freight expenses associated with the receipt in and shipment out of our inventory 
in addition  cost of revenue includes the cost of materials  labor and overhead for our contract assembly and gbs services 
margins the it product industry in which we operate is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
our gross margin has fluctuated between and annually over the past three years due to changes in the mix of products and services we offer  customers we sell to  competition  seasonality and replacement of less profitable business with investments in higher margin and more profitable lines and lower costs associated with increased efficiencies 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin 
generally  when our revenue becomes more concentrated on limited products or customers  our gross margin tends to decrease due to increased pricing pressure from oem suppliers or reseller customers 
our operating margin has also fluctuated between and annually over the past three years  based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale  the management of our operating expenses  changes in the relative mix of our distribution  contract assembly and global business services revenue  and the timing of our acquisitions and investments 
recent acquisitions we seek to augment our services offering growth with strategic acquisitions of businesses and assets that complement and expand our global business services capabilities

the facility is six hundred and twenty thousand square feet 
the total purchase price for this facility was approximately million 
as of fiscal year end  synnex canada has completed its plan for consolidating multiple existing ontario area facilities in canada into this facility 
restructuring charges in fiscal year  in connection with the acquisition of new age  we recorded liabilities of million under emerging issues task force  or eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  or eitf the measures  which included workforce reductions and facilities consolidation  were intended to align our capacity and infrastructure  and utilize synergies within the business to provide more cost effective services to our customers 
these charges were primarily associated with workforce reductions of million and facilities consolidation of million 
in fiscal year  in connection with the acquisition of rgc we announced a restructuring program in canada 
the measures  which included workforce reductions  facilities consolidation and other related expenses  are intended to align our capacity and infrastructure  and utilize synergies within the business to provide more cost effective services to our customers 
during fiscal year we accrued million in restructuring costs against goodwill related to the rgc acquisition in canada under eitf these charges are primarily associated with facilities consolidation of million  workforce reductions of million and contract termination costs of million

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the net book value of the property was million at november  economic and industry trends our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for it products 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products and overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it distribution industry and increased price based competition 
the gbs industry is extremely competitive 
the customers performance measures are based on competitive pricing terms and quality of services 
accordingly  we could be subject to pricing pressure and may experience a decline in our average selling prices for our services 
seasonality our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the it products industry 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end users 
in addition  with the recent additions of rgc and new age  both of which have higher concentrations of consumer electronics sales  we expect that our fourth quarter seasonal spike will be larger 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan for a limited number of our directors and employees 
we maintain a liability on our balance sheet for salary and bonus amounts deferred by participants and we accrue interest expense on uninvested amounts 
interest expense on the deferred amounts is classified in interest expense and finance charges  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
the plan allows for the participants to direct investments of deferred amounts in equity securities and other investments 
the equity securities are classified as trading securities 
the gains losses on the deferred compensation equity securities are recorded in other income expense  net and an equal amount is charged or credited if losses to selling  general and administrative expenses relating to compensation amounts which are payable to the plan participants 
the loss on the deferred compensation investments was million in the fiscal year 
the gain on the deferred compensation investments was million and million in the and fiscal years  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussions and analyses of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to accounts receivable  vendor programs  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and a variety of other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
these provisions are reviewed and adjusted periodically by us 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we purchase licensed software products from oem vendors and distribute them to customers 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of software products when a purchase order exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
subsequent to the sale of software products  we generally have no obligation to provide any modification  customization  upgrades  enhancements  or any other post sales customer support 
our mexico operation primarily focuses on projects with the mexican government and other local agencies that are long term in nature 
under the agreements  the payments are due on a monthly basis and are contingent upon performing certain services and meeting certain conditions 
we recognize product revenue and cost of revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
we provide our gbs services to our customers under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service we offer 
these agreements are usually short term in nature and subject to early termination by the customers or the company for any reason  typically with to days notice 
revenue is generally recognized over the term of the contract if the service has already been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for outstanding balances 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the accounts receivable  credit evaluations of customers financial condition and existence of credit insurance 
we also evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience with collections and value and adequacy of collateral received from customers 
oem supplier programs 
we receive funds from oem suppliers for inventory price protection  product rebates  marketing and infrastructure reimbursement  and promotion programs 
product rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue 
marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs are recorded  net of direct costs  in selling  general and administrative expense 
any excess funds associated with these programs are recorded in cost of revenue 
we accrue rebates based on the terms of the program and sales of qualifying products 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
amounts received or receivable from oem suppliers that are not yet earned are deferred on our balance sheet 
actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
in addition  if market conditions were to deteriorate due to an economic downturn  oem suppliers may change the terms of some or all of these programs or cease them altogether 
any such change could lower our gross margins on products we sell or revenue earned 
we also provide reserves for receivables on oem supplier programs for estimated losses resulting from oem suppliers inability to pay  or rejections of such claims by oem suppliers 
inventories 
our inventory levels are based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of 
table of contents future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in our cost of revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  our ability to return to oem suppliers a certain percentage of our purchases  and protection from loss in value of inventory under our oem supplier agreements 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets on an annual basis during our fourth quarter  regardless if there is evidence or suspicion of impairment 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future undiscounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
factors we consider important  which may cause impairment include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results 
in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
 a two step impairment test is required to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
for the purpose of goodwill analysis  we have three reporting units  as defined by sfas no 
our distribution services business segment is comprised of one distribution services reporting unit and the gbs business segment is comprised of two reporting units contact center and web hosting domain name registration 
we conducted our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we used discounted cash flows  using five years of projected unleveraged free cash flows and terminal ebitda earnings multiples which were based on precedent transactions 
the discount rates used for the analysis reflected a weighted average cost of capital based on industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization 
the discounted cash flow valuation uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows 
we also considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in the industry 
as a result of this work  under each fair value measurement methodology considered  we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
also  we compared our current market capitalization relative to our book value 
while our common stock generally declined in the final eight weeks of the fiscal year  our common stock still outperformed the nyse stock market 
we believe the decline in our market capitalization was due to the overall economy and stock market performance 
we do not believe that the decline in the stock price was caused by events directly related to us 
there were no events in the last quarter of the fiscal year that had a significant impact on our financial performance 
while market capitalization generally reflects investors expectations of future performance  the fair value of a reporting unit is not represented by our market capitalization alone 
for example  the control premium that a 
table of contents third party would be willing to pay to obtain a controlling interest in us was considered when determining fair value 
to estimate the control premium for synnex  we considered recent transactions with comparable companies in the distribution industry and our unique competitive advantages that would likely provide synergies to a market participant 
in addition  we considered factors such as the performance of our competitors  which we believe contributed to the decline in our stock price and recent volatility in our trading price prior to november  that did not reflect our underlying fair value 
we believe there is a reasonable basis for the excess of estimated fair value of our reporting units over our market capitalization 
we estimated our fair value based on our financial performance in the fourth quarter and the estimated control premium based on recent historical transactions and concluded that the fair value exceeded our book value 
the estimated fair value of our three reporting units requires judgment and the use of estimates by management 
potential factors requiring assessment include trends in our stock price  variance in results of operations from our projections  and additional acquisition transactions in our industry that reflect a control premium 
any of these potential factors may cause us to re evaluate goodwill during any quarter throughout the year 
if an impairment charge were to be taken for goodwill it would be a non cash charge and would not impact our cash position or cash flows  however  such charge could have a material impact to our equity and statement of operations 
therefore  our goodwill impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge for the fiscal years ended  or we performed an analysis of the fair value of the long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
no impairment loss was recorded for the periods presented 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit  intangible asset or a long lived asset is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimating foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
actual results could differ from our estimates

the revenue generated in our gbs segments relates to services such as demand generation  pre sales support  product marketing  print and fulfillment  back office it and development outsourcing  post sales technical support  webhosting and domain name registration 
the programs and customer service requirements change frequently from one period to the next and are often not comparable 
our increase in distribution revenue year over year for the fiscal year ended november   was primarily attributable to our acquisition of new age on april  in the united states and also to the full year impact of the acquisitions of pc wholesale and rgc  which occurred in fiscal year in the united states and canada  respectively 
more than of the increase in our gbs revenue year over year for the fiscal year ended november  was attributable to full impact of the acquisitions made in fiscal years and the remaining increase in revenue was a result of continued organic growth 

table of contents the fiscal year increase in revenue from fiscal year was primarily attributable to continued growth in our business in the united states and canada  overall increased demand for our products and services  increased selling and marketing efforts and the contribution from our acquisitions made during the fiscal years and these increases were somewhat mitigated by the general economic decline in the second half of  continued significant competition in the it distribution marketplace  oem supplier direct sales models  and our desire to focus on operating income growth before revenue growth 
gross profit fiscal years ended november  percent change to to in thousands gross profit percentage of revenue our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the average selling prices  variety of products and services we sell  the customers to whom we sell  our sources of revenue by division  rebate and discount programs from our suppliers  freight costs  reserves for inventory losses  fluctuations in revenue and overhead costs of our contract assembly and our mix of business including our gbs services 
our gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased by basis points over the prior fiscal year primarily due to the expansion of our gbs services  greater success in maximizing our variable incentives and continued focus on costs  inventory and freight management 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue by basis points in fiscal year over fiscal year was mainly due to continued focus on improving all aspects of gross profit within our business  customer and product mix  gross margin contributions from our acquisitions over the past year  and our increased value added services 
no specific products or customers  or changes in pricing strategy individually or in the aggregate  contributed significantly to the change in gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal years ended november  percent change to to in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue approximately two thirds of our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs such as salaries  commissions  bonuses  share based compensation  deferred compensation expense or income  and temporary personnel fees

the decrease in interest expense and finance charges  net  in fiscal year from fiscal year was mainly due to lower finance charges of million due to lower flooring sales and lower interest rates 
this decrease was offset by lower interest income primarily from our mexico operation of million

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuations of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes or 
table of contents interpretations in tax laws  regulations or accounting principles

minority interest 
minority interest is the portion of earnings from operations attributable to others

the primary uses of cash have been to fund working capital  for acquisitions and for the generation of increased sales 
to increase our market share and better serve our customers  we may further expand our operations through investments or acquisitions 
we expect that such expansion would require an initial investment in personnel  facilities and operations 
such investment may be more costly than similar investments in current operations 
as a result of these investments  we may experience an increase in cost of sales and operating expenses that is disproportionate to revenue from those operations 
these investments or acquisitions would likely be funded primarily by additional borrowings or issuing common stock

the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest on the notes is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning november  in addition  we will pay contingent interest in respect of any six month period from may to november or from november to may  with the initial six month period commencing may   if the trading price of the notes for each of the ten trading days immediately preceding the first day of the applicable six month period equals or more of the principal amount of the notes

related party transactions we have a business relationship with mitac international  a publicly traded company in taiwan  that began in when it became our primary investor through its affiliates 
as of november   mitac international and its affiliates beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
in addition  matthew miau  the chairman emeritus of our board of directors  is also the chairman of mitac international and a director or officer of mitac international s affiliates 
as a result  mitac international generally has significant influence over us and over the outcome of all matters submitted to stockholders for consideration  including any merger or acquisition of ours 
among other things  this could have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control over us with the loss of any premium that stockholders otherwise might receive in connection with such a transaction 
we work closely with mitac international to collaborate on oem outsourcing opportunities and jointly market mitac international s design and electronic manufacturing services and our contract assembly capabilities 
this relationship has enabled us to build relationships with mitac international s customers and we continue to work with and depend on mitac international to jointly serve our shared customers 
we purchased inventories  including notebook computers  motherboards and other peripherals  from mitac international and its affiliates totaling approximately million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
our sales to mitac international and its affiliates during fiscal years  and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
most of these purchases and sales were pursuant to our master supply agreement with mitac international and sun microsystems  one of our contract assembly customers 
our business relationship to date with mitac international has been informal and is not governed by long term commitments or arrangements with respect to pricing terms  revenue or capacity commitments 
accordingly  we negotiate manufacturing  pricing and other material terms on a case by case basis with mitac international and our contract assembly customers for a given project 
while mitac international is a related party and a controlling stockholder  we believe that the significant terms under these agreements  including pricing  would not materially differ from the terms we could have negotiated with unaffiliated third parties  and we have adopted a policy requiring that material transactions with mitac international or its related parties be approved by our audit committee  which is composed solely of independent directors 
in addition  mr 
miau s compensation is approved by the nominating and corporate governance committee  which is also 
table of contents composed solely of independent directors 
if mitac international s ownership interest in us decreases as a result of sales of our stock and additional dilution  its interest in the success of our business and operations may decrease as well 
we remain dependent on mitac international as a contract assembly partner and any change in the pricing or other material terms demanded by mitac international could have a material adverse effect on our business  particularly our contract assembly business with sun microsystems 
beneficial ownership of our common stock by mitac international 
as noted above  mitac international and its affiliates in the aggregate beneficially owned approximately of our common stock as of november  these shares are owned by the following entities mitac international synnex technology international corp

synnex technology international corp  or synnex technology international  is a separate entity from us and is a publicly traded corporation in taiwan 
shares held via peer development ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of synnex technology international 
mitac international owns a minority interest in mitac incorporated  a privately held taiwanese company  which in turn holds a minority interest in synnex technology international 
while the ownership structure of mitac international and its affiliates is complex  it has not had a material adverse effect on our business in the past  and we do not expect it to do so in the future 
during fiscal year  we purchased shares of mitac international and one of its affiliates related to the deferred compensation plan of robert huang  our then president and chief executive officer 
during fiscal year  we purchased additional shares of mitac international related to mr 
huang s deferred compensation plan 
as of november   the value of the investment was million 
except as described herein  none of our officers or directors has an interest in mitac international or its affiliates 
synnex technology international is a publicly traded corporation in taiwan that currently provides distribution and fulfillment services to various markets in asia and australia  and is also a potential competitor of ours 
neither mitac international nor synnex technology international is restricted from competing with us 
in the future  we may increasingly compete with synnex technology international  particularly if our business in asia expands or synnex technology international expands its business into geographies or customers we serve 
although synnex technology international is a separate entity from us  it is possible that there will be confusion as a result of the similarity of our names 
moreover  we cannot limit or control the use of the synnex name by synnex technology international in certain geographies and our use of the synnex name may be restricted as a result of registration of the name by synnex technology international or the prior use in jurisdictions where it currently operates
