the execution of the plan is contingent upon successful bargaining unit negotiations with the labor unions at each facility 
the process currently involves closing two manufacturing facilities and significantly downsizing a third facility beginning in the second quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal resulting in a reduction of  square feet of manufacturing space and generating annual savings estimated at approximately million 
the cost of the restructuring is expected to approximate million with of the total charges occurring in fiscal year additionally  we have specific initiatives related to improved customer satisfaction  reduction of defects  shortened lead times  improved inventory turns and on time deliveries  reduction of warranty costs  and improved working capital utilization

in march  we entered into a revolving credit facility  which provides availability up to million 
provided there is no default  the company may request an increase in the availability of the revolving credit facility by an amount not exceeding million  subject to lender approval 
the revolving credit facility matures february we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our recently amended revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations  restructuring activities and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon no further deterioration in the economy and successful execution of our current business plan which focuses on opportunities to consolidate our manufacturing footprint in north america  continued implementation of lean  and improving working capital utilization  specifically inventory management 
on may   the credit facility was amended to increase the amount of restructuring charges to be excluded from the fixed charge coverage ratio 
as part of the amendment  certain senior subordinated note repurchases were also excluded from the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant calculation 
at march   the revolving credit facility was not drawn and the available amount  net of outstanding letters of credit of million  totaled million 
interest is payable at a eurodollar rate or a prime rate plus an applicable margin determined by our leverage ratio 
at our current leverage ratio  we qualify for the lowest applicable margin level  which amounts to basis points for eurodollar borrowings and zero basis points for prime rate based borrowings 
the revolving credit facility is secured by all us inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the corresponding credit agreement associated with the revolving credit facility places certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including certain financial requirements and a limitation on dividend payments  with which we were in compliance as of march  the senior subordinated notes notes issued on september  amounted to million at march  and are due november  provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restricted payments 
on or after november   the notes are redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at prices declining annually from to on and after november  in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture for such notes  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future us subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit are available to meet short term working capital needs for certain of our subsidiaries operating outside of the us the lines of credit are available on an offering basis  meaning that transactions under the line of credit will be on such terms and conditions  including interest rate  maturity  representations  covenants and events of default  as mutually agreed between our subsidiaries and the local bank at the time of each specific transaction 
as of march   significant unsecured credit lines totaled approximately million  of which million was drawn 
in addition to the above facilities  our foreign subsidiaries have certain secured credit lines 
as of march   significant secured credit lines totaled  of which million was drawn 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of march   by period of estimated payments due total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal more than five years long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c interest obligations d letter of credit obligations uncertain tax positions other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap e total a as described in note to our consolidated financial statements

c we have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased 
we estimate that  at any given point in time  our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate million

our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
higher capital expenditures in fiscal and were the result of new product development and productivity enhancing equipment along with normal maintenance items 
we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be in the range of million 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico  south america and asia pacific 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
with changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations as part of our continuing evaluation of its businesses  the company determined that its integrated material handling conveyor systems business univeyor a s no longer provided a strategic fit with its long term growth and operational objectives 
on july   the company completed the sale of univeyor a s  which business represented the majority of our former solutions segment 
in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets the results of operations of the univeyor business have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations and statements of cash flows presented herein 
in connection with the sale of univeyor a s on july   the company used cash on hand to repay million in amounts outstanding on univeyor s lines of credit and fixed term bank debt 
in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised at the time the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
due to the uncertainty of its collection  the note has been recorded at its estimated net realizable value of principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly  million of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal  net of tax 
all interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in note to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of   and as of march   and  respectively  are primarily based on long term bond rates 
the increase in the discount rates for fiscal  and resulted in an  and  respectively  decrease in the projected benefit obligation as of march   and  respectively 
the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of for each of the years ended march   and is based on the composition of the asset portfolios approximately equities and fixed income at march  and their long term historical returns 
the assets realized actual losses of million in fiscal as a result of the significant volatility in us capital markets during the last half of fiscal and gains of million in fiscal our under funded status as of march  and was million and million  or and of the projected benefit obligation  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
the under funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate million  which is up significantly from the fiscal amount of million due to an increase in amortization of unrecognized losses and lower expected returns on the depressed asset values 
the factors outlined above may result in increases in funding requirements over time  unless there is considerable market appreciation in the plans asset values 
pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year are expected to increase by approximately million compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march  and as of march  and is based on expected wage trends and historical patterns 
the healthcare inflation assumptions of   and for fiscal  and  respectively are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to our consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
these actuarial estimates are subject to a high degree of uncertainty due to a variety of factors  including extended lag time in the reporting and resolution of claims  trends or changes in claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations 
as a result  actual costs could differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
we reassess trends and usage on a regular basis and if we identify changes  we revise our estimated allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on formulas applied to historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable agings 
impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceeds their fair market value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment as of march  in millions balance as of march  property  plant and equipment  net acquired intangibles with estimable useful lives other assets impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair market value as determined by the discounted cash flow method or in the case of negative cash flow  an independent market appraisal of the asset 
goodwill impairment testing 
our goodwill balance  million as of march   is subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually  as of the end of february  and more frequently whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate there may be impairment 
these events or circumstances could include a significant long term adverse change in the business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
during fiscal  we tested goodwill for impairment as of february  we test goodwill at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our operating segment 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segment constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we also aggregate components that have similar economic characteristics into single reporting units for example  similar products and or services  similar long term financial results  product processes  classes of customers  etc we currently have four reporting units as compared to five reporting units for the fiscal goodwill impairment test 
the sale of univeyor a s resulted in the divestiture of a reporting unit 
we aggregated the fiscal acquisition of pfaff beteiligungs gmbh into another reporting unit with similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
only two of our four reporting units carry goodwill 
one reporting unit had a carrying amount exceeding the reporting unit s fair value at february  due to an expected decrease in projected revenues and cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit  combined with a higher weighted average cost of capital due to market conditions 
therefore  the company initiated step two of the goodwill impairment test which involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities other than goodwill and comparing it to the carrying amount of goodwill 
the company estimated that the implied fair value of goodwill for the one reporting unit was less than its carrying value by approximately million which has been recorded as an impairment charge during the fourth quarter ended march  prior to the impairment charge  this reporting unit had goodwill of million 
the impairment charge is based on the allocation of fair value in the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
future impairment indicators  such as declines in forecasted cash flows  may cause additional significant impairment charges 
impairment charges could be based on factors such as the company s stock price  forecasted cash flows  assumptions used  control premiums or other variables 
testing goodwill for impairment requires us to estimate fair values of reporting units using significant estimates and judgmental factors 
the key estimates and factors used in our discounted cash flow valuation include revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts  terminal value  and the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows 
the compound annual growth rate for revenue during the first five years of our projections ranged between and 
the terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years which reflects our estimate of long term gross domestic product growth 
operating profit margins were projected to return to historical norms by between fiscal and fiscal in the individual reporting units 
the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the consolidated company was determined to be based upon an analysis of similar companies and their debt to equity mix  their related volatility and the size of their market capitalization 
we also consider any additional risk of each individual reporting unit achieving its forecasts  and adjust the weighted average cost of capital applied when determining each reporting unit s estimated fair value 
the weighted average cost of capital determined for each reporting unit as of the february  test date ranged between and 
future changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our goodwill impairment tests 
for example  a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than basis points or an increase in the weighted average cost of capital greater than basis points would have indicated impairment in one reporting unit as of february  whose goodwill was million 
if the projected long term revenue growth rates  profit margins  or terminal rates are considerably lower  and or the estimated weighted average cost of capital is considerably higher  future testing may indicate further impairment of one or more of the company s reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would likely be impaired 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we generally consider market value declines to be other than temporary if there are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
we also consider the nature of the underlying investments and other market conditions 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as of march   we had million of gross deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the deferred tax assets relate principally to liabilities including employee benefit plans and insurance reserves 
the deferred tax assets include million related to various state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for which a million deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider recent earnings projections  allowable tax carryforward periods  tax planning strategies and historical earnings performance to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
changes in these factors could cause us to adjust our valuation allowance  which would impact our income tax expense when we determine that these factors have changed

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of or surcharges on our products 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  china  the united kingdom  france  hungary and germany and sell our products in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies  the mexican peso and the chinese yuan 
for example  when the us dollar weakens against the euro  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in euros increases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  a decline in the rate of exchange between the euro and the us dollar impacts net income by approximately million 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
during  the company entered into cross currency swaps and foreign exchange forward agreements to hedge changes in the value of intercompany loans to certain foreign subsidiaries due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the notional amount of these derivatives is million and all contracts mature by september  as of march   the fair value of these derivatives was a million loss that was recorded to earnings and is included in foreign currency exchange loss 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
at march  and  approximately and of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  respectively 
at those dates  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates in fiscal and would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
like many industrial manufacturers  we are involved in asbestos related litigation 
in continually evaluating costs relating to our estimated asbestos related liability  we review  among other things  the incidence of past and recent claims  the historical case dismissal rate  the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs  our recent and historical resolution of the cases  the number of cases pending against us  the status and results of broad based settlement discussions  and the number of years such activity might continue 
based on this review  we have estimated our share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims 
this estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability 
we will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable 
based on actuarial information  we have estimated our asbestos related aggregate liability through march  and march  to range between million and million using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of to years 
our estimation of our asbestos related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles approximates million which has been reflected as a liability in the consolidated financial statements as of march  the recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation 
this liability may fluctuate based on the uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims  which may be influenced by a number of factors  including the outcome of the ongoing broad based settlement negotiations  defensive strategies  and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad based settlement program 
of this amount  management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately million over the next months 
because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years  management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after tax effect on our financial condition or our liquidity  although the net after tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period
