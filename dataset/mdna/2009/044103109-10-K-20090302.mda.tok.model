item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  representing those policies considered most vital to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
management agreements in connection with our acquisitions of marriott crystal gateway hotel in arlington  virginia  on july  and the hotel cnl portfolio on april   we assumed certain existing management agreements 
based on our review of these management agreements  we concluded that the terms of certain management agreements are more favorable to the respective managers than typical current market management agreements 
as a result  we recorded unfavorable contract liabilities related to these management agreements of million as of the respective acquisition dates based on the present value of expected cash outflows over the initial terms of the related agreements 
such unfavorable contract liabilities are being amortized as non cash reductions to incentive management fees on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the related agreements 
in evaluating unfavorable contract liabilities  our analysis involves considerable management judgment and assumptions 
income taxes at december   we increased the valuation allowance to approximately million to fully offset our net deferred tax asset 
as a result of ashford trs losses in and  and the limitations imposed by the internal revenue code on the utilization of net operating losses of acquired subsidiaries  we believe that it is more likely than not our net deferred tax asset will not be realized  and therefore  have provided a valuation allowance to fully reserve against these amounts 
at december   we also recorded a deferred tax liability for the difference in the final purchase price allocation for financial reporting purposes and tax basis for a real estate asset owned in one of our consolidated joint ventures 
in addition  at december   ashford trs has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which are available to offset future taxable income  if any  through the analysis utilized in determining our deferred tax asset valuation allowance involves considerable management judgment and assumptions 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
 effective january  fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the 
table of contents recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
fin no 
requires that a determination be made as to whether it is more likely than not that a tax position taken  based on its technical merits  will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any appeals and litigation processes 
if the more likely than not threshold is met  the related tax position must be measured to determine the amount of provision or benefit  if any  to recognize in the financial statements 
fin no 
applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  but does not apply to tax positions related to fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states  and in canada is final year for canadian filings 
tax years through remain subject to potential examination by certain federal and state taxing authorities  respectively 
no income tax examinations are currently in process 
as we determined no material unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities exist  the adoption of fin no 
 effective january   did not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
we classify interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes as income tax expense 
investment in hotel properties hotel properties are generally stated at cost 
however  the initial properties contributed upon our formation are stated at the predecessor s historical cost  net of any impairment charges  plus a minority interest partial step up related to the acquisition of minority interest from third parties associated with four of the initial properties 
in addition  in connection with the hotel cnl portfolio acquired on april  and subsequent asset swap completed on december   we own between ownership interest in certain hotel properties owned by joint ventures 
for these hotel properties  the carrying basis attributable to the joint venture partners minority ownership is recorded at the predecessor s historical cost  net of any impairment charges  while the carrying basis attributable to our majority ownership is recorded based on the allocated purchase price of our ownership interest in the joint ventures 
all improvements and additions which extend the useful life of hotel properties are capitalized 
impairment of investment in hotel properties and hotel related intangibles hotel properties and hotel related intangibles are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel property will be sold before its previously estimated useful life expires  and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel property s net book value or the carrying value of the related intangibles may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the impairment of hotel properties  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  holding period  expected useful life  future capital expenditures  and fair values  which considers capitalization rates  discount rates  and comparable selling prices 
if an asset was deemed to be impaired  we would record an impairment charge for the amount that the property s net book value exceeds its fair value 
to date  no such impairment charges have been recognized 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of the assets  while amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
presently  hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over lives which range from to years for buildings and improvements and to years for furniture  fixtures  and equipment 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  a change in estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss as well as resulting gains or losses on potential hotel sales 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations we classify assets as held for sale when management has obtained a firm commitment from a buyer  and consummation of the sale is considered probable and expected within one year 
the related operations of assets held for sale are reported as discontinued if a such operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  both operationally and financially  from the our ongoing operations  b such operations and cash flows will be eliminated from ongoing operations once the disposal occurs  and c we will not have any significant continuing involvement subsequent to the disposal 
notes receivable we provide mezzanine and first mortgage financing in the form of notes receivable  which are recorded at cost  adjusted for net origination fees and costs 
these loans are held for investment and are intended to be held to maturity and accordingly  are recorded at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts and net of the allowance for losses when such loan is deemed to be impaired 
premiums  discounts  and net origination fees are amortized or accreted as an adjustment to interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the loan 
we discontinue accruing interest and amortizing discounts premiums when the contractual payment of interest and or principal is past due 
unpaid interest accrued and discounts amortized are reversed 

table of contents in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin no 
r  variable interest entities  as defined  must be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the variable interest entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
our mezzanine and first mortgage loan receivables are each secured by various hotel properties or partnership interests in hotel properties and are subordinate to primary loans related to the secured hotels 
all such loans receivable are considered to be variable interests in the entities that own the related hotels  which are variable interest entities 
however  we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these hotel properties as a result of holding these loans 
therefore  we do not consolidate such hotels for which we have provided financing 
interests in entities acquired or created in the future will be evaluated based on fin no 
criteria  and such entities will be consolidated  if required 
in evaluating fin no 
r criteria  our analysis involves considerable management judgment and assumptions 
impairment of notes receivable we review notes receivables for impairment at each balance sheet date pursuant statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts recorded as assets on the balance sheet according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we apply normal loan review and underwriting procedures as may be implemented or modified from time to time in making that judgment 
when a loan is impaired  we measure impairment based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate against the value of the asset recorded on the balance sheet 
we may also measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  we would record a reserve for loan losses through a charge to income for any shortfall  if any 
for example  if a loan is determined to be impaired but based on the present value of the expected cash flow calculation  does not result in any shortfall  no charge is taken 
our assessment of impairment is based on considerable judgment and estimates 
based on our assessment and judgment  no such impairment charges have been recorded for our notes receivable as of december  however  a loss reserve was established for a note receivable held by our unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a ownership 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item investment in unconsolidated joint venture investment in a joint venture in which we have a ownership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting by recording the initial investment and our percentage of interest in the joint venture s net income 
the equity accounting method is employed due to the fact that we do not control the joint venture pursuant to the guidance provided by emerging issue task force eitf abstract no 
derivative financial instruments and hedges we primarily use interest rate derivatives to hedge our asset cash flows 
we also use non hedge derivatives to capitalize on the historical correlation between changes in libor london interbank offered rate and revpar revenue per available room and to hedge our asset cash flows 
interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges provide us with interest rate protection above the strike rate on the cap and result in us receiving interest payments when actual rates exceed the cap strike 
because these derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas  the related interest savings is reported as other income rather than a reduction of interest expense in accordance with gaap 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings  while the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings 
we assess the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in fair value or cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in fair value or cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction 
for derivatives not designated as hedges  changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the valuation of these instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual 
table of contents terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves  and implied volatilities 
the fair values of interest rate derivatives are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments receipts 
the variable cash payments receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves 
the fair values of interest rate options are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates fell below the strike rate of the floors or rise above the strike rate of the caps 
the variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the floor cap are based on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities 
to comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own non performance risk and the respective counterparty s non performance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of non performance risk  we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees

revised  business combinations 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combinations 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing accounting principles until january  we expect sfas r will affect our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  term and size of the acquisitions  if any  we consummate after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be re characterized as non controlling interests and classified as a component of equity

executive overview we are a real estate investment trust reit that commenced operations upon completion of our initial public offering and related formation transactions on august  at december   we owned interests in hotel properties  which included direct ownership in hotel properties and between interests in six hotel properties through equity investments with joint venture partners 
of these hotels  were acquired in in addition  at december   we owned million of mezzanine or first mortgage loans receivable and a interest in a joint venture with prudential real estate investors prei formed in january the prei jv 
the joint venture owned million of mezzanine loans at december  
table of contents based on our primary business objectives and forecasted operating conditions  our key priorities and financial strategies include  among other things preserving capital  enhancing liquidity and implementing cost saving measures  acquiring hotels with a favorable current yield with an opportunity for appreciation  implementing selective capital improvements designed to increase profitability  directing our hotel managers to minimize operating costs and increase revenues  originating or acquiring mezzanine loans  and other investments that our board of directors deems appropriate 
throughout  the sluggish economy in the united states has caused slight declines in revpar revenue per available room and occupancy throughout the lodging industry 
for  forecasts for the lodging industry are considerably bearish 
to hedge our asset cash flows  we enter into derivative transactions with major financial institutions 
in march  we executed a five year interest rate swap on billion of fixed rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of for a floating interest rate of libor plus 
in conjunction with the swap execution  we sold a five year libor floor notional amount of billion at and purchased a libor cap notional amount of billion at for the first three years 
on september   we entered into an additional libor interest rate cap with million notional amount at effective october  for one year 
subsequently in december  we purchased a one year billion interest flooridor to bring down the libor floor to 
under the flooridor  the counterparties will pay us the interest on the billion notional amount when the interest rates are below the original floor of and above the new floor of 
the upfront cost of the swap  libor cap  and floor transactions was million 
the net fair value at december  was million

therefore  in any given quarterly period  period over period results will have different ending dates 
for marriott managed hotels  the fourth quarters of  and ended january   december  and december   respectively 
revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate adr charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include revenues from food and beverage or parking  telephone  or other guest services generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
we also use revpar to compare the results of our hotels between periods and to analyze results of our comparable hotels comparable hotels represent hotels we have owned for the entire year 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in occupancy are generally accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs 
revpar improvements attributable to increases in adr are generally accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees 
in april  we acquired a property hotel portfolio cnl portfolio from cnl hotels and resorts  inc cnl 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired of properties and interests ranging from to in properties through existing joint ventures 
in conjunction with the cnl transaction  we acquired the remaining joint venture interest in one hotel property not owned by cnl at the acquisition and acquired in may two other hotel properties previously owned by cnl collectively  the cnl acquisition

excluding the four hotel properties under renovation  the remaining comparable hotel properties revpar decreased from in to in driven by a increase in adr which effect is partially offset by a decrease in occupancy 
due to the economic downturn  many hotels experienced lower occupancy rates  however  the lower occupancy is partially offset by moderate increases in adr which is consistent with industry trends 
certain hotels benefited from increasing or garnering more favorable group room night contracts  eliminating less favorable contracts  and charging higher rates on transient business 
although occupancy increased at several hotels  renovations at certain hotels reduced room availability  which offset these increases

based on trailing month net cash flow from the portfolio  the debt service coverage ratio at closing through our position of approximately x  and our investment in the capital structure of approximately to loan to cost  or  per key  we expect full repayment of the principal amount at maturity and are recognizing the discount amount of million over the potential four year life of the loan 
there can be no assurance that our estimate of collectible amounts will not change over time or that they will be representative of the amounts we may actually collect 
the risk is that changes in market conditions may prevent the borrower from repaying the loan amount in full and we may have to reverse some of the discount recognized in our income stream in prior periods which may have a material impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
asset management fees and other increased  during the increase is primarily related to a sourcing fee and service fee of  from prei jv and a consulting fee of  from a consulting agreement we entered into in december in connection with an asset swap transaction

corporate general and administrative expense increased to million for compared to million for these expenses include non cash stock based compensation expense of million and million for and  respectively 
excluding the non cash stock based compensation  these expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the increase in headcount and audit and legal expenses and as a result of the cnl acquisition 
these increases were partially offset by a  credit recorded for the deferred compensation expense as the accrued liability under the deferred compensation declined due to the decrease in the value of the related investments 
in december  we implemented a cost saving plan at the corporate level which includes reductions in overhead from staff layoffs  salary freezes  and reduced benefits and fees along with other cost saving measures

interest expense and amortization of loan costs 
interest expense and amortization of loan costs increased million to million for from million for the increase is primarily attributable to higher average debt balance in as a result of the cnl acquisition in april as the related borrowings on the acquisition were not outstanding for the entire period

unrealized losses were  and  for and  respectively  on interest rate caps that we entered into in and income tax expense benefit 
we recorded an income tax expense of million for and a benefit of million for the income tax for consists primarily of the expense associated with fully reserving our deferred tax asset at december  as a result of ashford trs losses in and  and the limitations imposed by the internal revenue code on the utilization of net operating losses of acquired subsidiaries  we believe that it is more likely than not our net deferred tax asset would not be realized  and therefore  had provided a valuation allowance to fully reserve against these amounts 
for  the income tax benefit related to the net loss associated with ashford trs 
minority interests in earnings of consolidated joint ventures 
minority interests represent the joint venture partners who have ownerships between to in six hotel properties owned and operated by our consolidated joint ventures 
we acquired these joint ventures in connection with the cnl acquisition in april income from consolidated joint ventures allocated to the minority interests was  for minority interest in earnings of operating partnership 
income from continuing operations allocated to these limited partners were  and million for and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations allocated to these limited partners was million and million for and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations 
included in income from discontinued operations were gains of million for operating results of discontinued operations also reflected interest and related debt expense of million and million for and  respectively 
in addition  unamortized loan costs of million and  in and  respectively  were written off when the related debt was repaid upon the sale of the hotel properties collateralizing that debt 
non gaap financial measures ebitda is defined as net income before interest expense  interest income other than interest income from mezzanine loans  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and minority interest in earnings of operating partnership 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors as it is an indicator of our ability to service debt and pay cash 
table of contents dividends 
ebitda  as calculated by us may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap as a indicator of liquidity 
the following table reconciles net income to ebitda in thousands unaudited year ended december  net income depreciation and amortization interest expense and amortization of loan costs income tax expense benefit minority interests in earnings of operating partnership interest income ebitda ebitda is not adjusted for income received from interest rate derivatives because the related derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas and therefore  this income is reported as other income instead of a reduction of interest expense in accordance with gaap 
the white paper on funds from operations ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses on sales of properties and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and net of adjustments for the portion of these items attributable to minority interests in earnings losses of operating partnership 
nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance of an equity reit to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined by gaap 
we compute ffo in accordance with our interpretation of standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that either do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or interpret the nareit definition differently than us 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to a gaap net income loss as an indication of our financial performance or b gaap cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
however  to facilitate a clear understanding of our historical operating results  we believe that ffo should be considered along with our net income loss and cash flows reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following table reconciles net income to ffo in thousands unaudited year ended december  net income preferred dividends net income available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization on real estate gains on sales of properties minority interests in earnings of operating partnership ffo liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds to meet our cash requirements include positive cash flow from operations  cash income from mezzanine loans  property refinancing proceeds  asset sales  property level preferred equity  return of capital from existing mezzanine loans  and income derived from the interest rate swap 
our principal uses of funds are expected to include possible operating shortfalls from mezzanine investments  owner funded capital expenditures  debt interest and principal payments  and repurchases of our securities 
items that impact our cash flows and liquidity are summarized as follows net cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities  pursuant to our consolidated statement of cash flows which includes the changes in balance sheet items  were million 
table of contents and million for and  respectively 
the decrease is principally due to the economic downturn in that resulted in decreased adr and declined occupancy 
these decreases are partially offset by the inclusion of an entire year of operations in the operating results for hotel properties related to the cnl acquisition 
net cash flows provided by used in investing activities 
for  investing activities provided net cash flows of million  which consisted of net proceeds of million from sales of hotel properties and one office building and a payment of million for the note receivable acquired by prei jv 
these cash inflows were partially offset by million for acquisitions or originations of notes receivable  million for the acquisition of interest in a mezzanine loan acquired by prei jv  and million of improvements to various hotel properties 
for  investing activities used net cash of billion  which consisted of billion for the cnl acquisition  million for improvements to various hotel properties and million for the acquisition of mezzanine loans 
these cash outlays were partially offset by million from the sales of hotel properties and one office building and million cash received from payments of notes receivables 
net cash flows used in provided by financing activities 
for  net cash flow used in financing activities was million consisting of payments of million on indebtedness and capital leases  million of dividends  million for entering into interest rate swap  floor and cap transactions  million for purchases of treasury shares  and million of debt refinancing costs 
these cash outlays were partially offset by million of aggregate draws on our million credit facility and refinances of existing mortgage loans  a  payment from minority interest in consolidated joint ventures and  attributed to buy ins of long term incentive partnership units issued to our executives under the our equity incentive plan 
for  net cash flow provided in financing activities was billion consisting of billion in debt borrowings  million of net proceeds from the issuance of series c preferred stock  million of net proceeds received from issuance of series d preferred stock  and million of net proceeds received from the follow on public offering in april these cash inflows were partially offset by payments of million on indebtedness and capital leases  million for the redemption of series c preferred stock  million of dividends  million of loan costs  million for penalties on early repayment of indebtedness and  for purchases of treasury shares 
we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under various debt agreements 
if we violate covenants in any debt agreements  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
violations of certain debt covenants may result in us being unable to borrow unused amounts under a line of credit  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
in any event  financial covenants under our current or future debt obligations could impair our planned business strategies by limiting our ability to borrow i beyond certain amounts or ii for certain purposes 
presently  our existing financial debt covenants primarily relate to maintaining minimum debt coverage ratios at certain properties  maintaining an overall minimum net worth  maintaining a maximum loan to value  and maintaining an overall minimum total assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in our credit agreements as amended 
in december  we negotiated an amendment with the banks in our million credit facility 
the main provision changes to the facility  which expires in after extension  include i reducing the fixed charge coverage ratio to x x at december  effective from the date of the amendment until march   at which time the ratio increases to x  ii reducing the revolver commitment level from million to million  iii reducing the maximum leverage ratio from to at december   iv adjusting the previous interest spread of to upward to a spread of to  and v suspending the dividend payable to common stockholders through  except to the extent of any minimum dividend required to maintain our reit status 
interest rate derivative transactions 
to hedge our asset cash flows  we enter into derivative transactions with major financial institutions 
in march  we executed a five year interest rate swap on billion of fixed rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of for a floating interest rate of libor plus 
in conjunction with the swap execution  we sold a five year libor floor notional amount of billion at and purchased a libor cap notional amount of billion at for the first three years 
on september   we entered into an additional libor interest rate cap with million notional amount at effective october  for a one year 
subsequently in december  we purchased a one year billion interest flooridor to bring down the libor floor to 
under this flooridor  the counterparties will pay us the interest on the billion notional amount when the interest rates are below the original floor of and above the new floor of 
the 
table of contents upfront cost of the swap  libor cap  and floor transactions was million 
the net fair value at december  was million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements included item authorization of repurchase of common and preferred shares and debt in the fourth quarter of  the board of directors authorized a million common stock repurchase program 
on september   we had completed the repurchase of substantially all of the shares authorized under this program  and the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common stock under the program 
in november  the board of directors modified the share repurchase program to include both common and preferred shares 
during the year ended december   we have repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million  and  shares of our series a preferred stock and million shares of our series d preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
in january  the board of directors authorized an additional million repurchase plan authorization excluding fees  commissions and all other ancillary expenses for i the repurchase of shares of the our common stock  series a preferred stock  series b preferred stock and series d preferred stock and or ii the prepayment of our outstanding debt obligations  including debt secured by our hotel assets and debt senior to our mezzanine or loan investments 
dividend policy 
effective with the fourth quarter ended december   and in conjunction with the credit facility amendment outlined above  the board of directors suspended the common stock dividend 
we expect to distribute the minimum dividend required to maintain our reit status in  which is likely to be determined  if necessary  in the fourth quarter of we continue to execute aggressive cost saving measures at the property level that include payroll freezes  vendor contract renegotiation and adjustments to service levels 
in addition  corporate level cost containment plans have been implemented which include reductions in overhead from staff layoffs  salary freezes  and reduced benefits and fees along with other cost saving measures 
we may incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to fund required distributions 
based upon the current level of operations  management believes that our cash flow from operations along with our significant cash balances will be adequate to meet upcoming anticipated requirements for scheduled maturities  dividends  working capital  capital expenditures  interest and upcoming scheduled principal payments  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
with respect to upcoming maturities  no assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or  if we do  what the amount and terms will be 
our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we may selectively pursue mortgage financing on individual properties and our mortgage investments 
we will acquire or develop additional hotels and invest in structured financings only as suitable opportunities arise  and we will not undertake such investments unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future hotel related investments are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from future borrowings under a credit facility or other loan or from proceeds from additional issuances of common stock  preferred stock  or other securities 
however  we have no formal commitment or understanding to invest in additional assets  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully make additional investments 
our existing hotels are located in developed areas that contain competing hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr  and revpar of any individual hotel could be materially and adversely affected by the current economic downturn  or an increase in the number or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities 
inflation we rely entirely on the performance of our properties and the ability of the properties managers to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
hotel operators can generally increase room rates rather quickly  but competitive pressures may limit their ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
our general and administrative costs  real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance  and utilities are subject to inflation as well 

table of contents seasonality our properties operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months and some during the winter months 
this seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases 
we anticipate that our cash flows from the operations of our properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to fund required distributions 
however  we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements during  we did not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements and do not currently anticipate any such arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in thousands payments due by period years total contractual obligations excluding extension options long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest obligations total contractual obligations contractual obligations including extension options long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest obligations total contractual obligations payments do not reflect the premiums of million that are being amortized as a reduction of interest expense 
for variable interest rate indebtedness  interest obligations are estimated based on the libor interest rate at december  in addition to the amounts discussed above  we also have management agreements which require us to pay monthly management fees  market service fees and other general fees  if required 
these management agreements expire from through see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments and notes receivable that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
at december   our billion debt portfolio included million of variable rate debt 
the impact on the results of operations of a basis point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate debt at december  would be approximately million per year 
based on the libor rates in effect on december   the interest rate derivatives we entered into in would result in an annual savings of approximately million 
due to the interest rate cap and floor on these derivatives  a basis point change to the libor rates would not change the amount of the interest savings 

table of contents periodically  we purchase derivatives to increase stability related to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps  caps and floors as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the derivative agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate caps provide us with interest rate protection above the strike rate on the cap and result in us receiving interest payments when interest rates exceed the cap strike 
in march  we entered into interest rate swap  cap and floor transactions that were not designated as hedges 
the changes in the fair market values of these transactions are recorded in earnings 
the following table summarizes our interest rate swap  caps and floor at december  and the earnings losses recognized for the year ended december  in thousands cash flow unrealized hedge gain loss notional interest designation fair recorded amount type rates yes no maturity value in earnings  interest rate cap yes interest rate cap no interest rate cap no interest rate cap yes interest rate cap yes interest rate cap yes interest rate cap no to  pays libor plus interest rate swap  receives fixed no   interest rate floor floor rate no   interest rate floor floor rate no   at december   our million notes receivable included million of variable rate notes 
the impact on the results of operations of a basis point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate notes at december  would be  annually 
the above amounts were determined based on the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowings and lending portfolios  and assume no changes in our capital structure 
as the information presented above includes only those exposures that existed at december   it does not consider exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
accordingly  the information presented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on exposures that arise during the period  the hedging strategies at the time  and the related interest rates
