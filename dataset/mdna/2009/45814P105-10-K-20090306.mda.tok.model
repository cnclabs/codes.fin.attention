item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for an explanation of forward looking statements 

table of contents risks related to our business we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of our earning assets 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
we are subject to lending risk 
there are inherent risks associated with our lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate 
increases in interest rates  minimum required payments  energy prices and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of the collateral securing loans  or demand for our loan products 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations that affect our lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil money penalties 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans 
these types of loans are typically larger than residential real estate and consumer loans  which made up the remaining of our loan portfolio 
because the portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial  agricultural  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans can lead to a significant increase in non performing loans 
increases in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our allowance for loan losses may be insufficient 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
this reserve represents our best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in our judgment is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects our ongoing evaluation of various factors  including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of regulatory examinations  and current economic conditions 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions and trends 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services primarily to customers in southern indiana  southern and central illinois  as well as in the chicago area  western  central and northern kentucky and southwest ohio 
we have commercial real estate loan production offices located in cleveland  cincinnati  and columbus  ohio  as well as louisville  kentucky  and we have a commercial banking team in the cincinnati  ohio area 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents current market developments may adversely affect our industry  business  results of operations and access to capital 
at the time of filing this report  the united states is in a recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and local governments and many companies are in serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
the current slowing economy is evidenced by the continued negative outlook and sentiment  market disruptions  slowing growth rates  declines in housing prices and increases in the consumer price index  in part driven by higher energy and food prices and by employment concerns 
dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to securities issued by government sponsored entities  credit default swaps and other derivative securities  in turn have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have ceased to provide funding to even the most credit worthy borrowers or to other financial institutions 
the resulting lack of available credit and lack of confidence in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our access to capital 
in particular  we face the following risks in connection with these events further declines in the housing market and the increased volatility of the stock market may adversely affect consumer confidence and may cause adverse changes in loan payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates 
the processes we use to estimate probable losses and impairment of assets  including investment securities  may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future charge offs 
additional losses and declines in financial performance in the banking industry could negatively impact the value of our trust preferred securities portfolio and result in additional other than temporary impairment  a decline in consumer confidence could also result in withdrawal of deposit funds by consumers  negatively impacting our liquidity 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events 
we may be required to pay higher fdic premiums because of the increased deposit coverage and the closure of other financial institutions could deplete the insurance fund of the fdic 
as each of the above conditions continues to exist or worsen  we could experience continuing or increased adverse effects on our financial condition 
increases in fdic insurance premiums could affect our earnings  liquidity and capital 
in february   the fdic adopted an interim rule increasing insurance assessments and also imposed a special basis point one time emergency special assessment 
the proposed basis point assessment would be based on deposits as of june  and would be payable at september  we estimate that the cost of the one time assessment will approximate  for us 
should the condition of the banking industry continue to decline  it is possible that the fdic could increase rates further or assess additional emergency assessments and that those increases or assessments could materially affect our reported earnings  liquidity or capital 
we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital 
we have an incentive to raise at least  by the end of the year in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrant we recently issued to the treasury department 
in that regard  a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital in response to deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market  deteriorating economic conditions  declines in real estate values and other factors 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 

table of contents there can be no assurance that recent legislative and regulatory initiatives to address difficult market and economic conditions will stabilize the united states banking system and the enactment of these initiatives may significantly affect our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or stock price 
in and continuing into  governments  regulators and central banks in the united states and worldwide have taken numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence  but asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity continues to be very limited 
the eesa authorizes the treasury department to  among other things  purchase up to  of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions and their holding companies 
the purpose of eesa is to restore confidence and stability to the united states banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
under the capital purchase program  the treasury department is purchasing equity securities from participating institutions 
for more information regarding our participation in the capital purchase program  see the discussion under the caption participation in capital purchase program in item business of this report 
the eesa also increased federal deposit insurance on most deposit accounts from to this increase is in place until the end of the arra  which was signed into law on february   includes a wide array of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health and education needs 
the failure of these significant legislative measures to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit or the trading price of our common stock 
the eesa and the arra followed  and have been followed by  numerous actions by the federal reserve  the united states congress  the treasury department  the fdic  the sec and others to address the current liquidity and credit crisis that has followed the sub prime mortgage market meltdown that began in these measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification  the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks  the lowering of the federal funds rate  emergency action against short selling practices  a temporary guaranty program for money market funds  the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers  and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector 
the purpose of these legislative and regulatory actions is to stabilize the united states banking system 
the eesa  the arra and the other regulatory initiatives described above may not have their desired effects 
if the volatility in the markets continues and economic conditions fail to improve or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
because of our participation in the capital purchase program  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends and repurchase our shares as well as restrictions on compensation paid to our executive officers 
pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement  our ability to declare or pay dividends on any of our shares is limited 
specifically  we are unable to declare or pay dividends on our common stock  junior preferred shares or pari passu preferred shares if we are in arrears on the payment of dividends on the treasury preferred stock 
further  we are not permitted to increase dividends on our common stock above the amount of our last quarterly cash dividend of per share without the treasury department s approval until december   unless all of the treasury preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred by the treasury department to unaffiliated third parties 
in addition  our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock is restricted 
the consent of the treasury department generally is required for us to make any stock repurchase other than purchases of treasury preferred stock or purchases of junior preferred shares or common stock in connection with the administration of any employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice until december   unless all of the treasury preferred stock has been redeemed or transferred by the treasury department to unaffiliated third parties 
further  our common stock  junior preferred shares or pari passu preferred shares may not be repurchased if we are in arrears on the payment of treasury preferred stock dividends 

table of contents as a recipient of government funding under the capital purchase program  we must comply with the executive compensation and corporate governance standards imposed by the arra for so long as the treasury department holds any securities acquired from us pursuant to the securities purchase agreement or upon exercise of the warrant  excluding any period during which the treasury department holds only the warrant 
these standards include but are not limited to i ensuring that incentive compensation plans and arrangements for senior executive officers do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten our value  ii required clawback of any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation paid or under a legally binding obligation to be paid to a senior executive officer or any of our next most highly compensated employees based on materially inaccurate financial statements or other materially inaccurate performance metric criteria  iii prohibitions on making golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and our five next most highly compensated employees  except for payments for services performed or benefits accrued  iv prohibitions on paying or accruing any bonus  retention award or incentive compensation with respect to our five most highly compensated employees or such higher number as the secretary of the treasury department may determine is in the public interest  except for grants of restricted stock that do not fully vest while we participate in the capital purchase program and do not have a value which exceeds one third of an employee s total annual compensation  v prohibitions on compensation plans that encourage manipulation of reported earnings  vi retroactive review of bonuses  retention awards or other compensation that the treasury department finds to be inconsistent with the purposes of the capital purchase program or otherwise contrary to the public interest  vii required establishment of a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  viii inclusion in our proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings of a non binding say on pay shareholder vote on the compensation of executives  and ix agreement not to claim a deduction  for federal income tax purposes  for compensation paid to any of the senior executive officers in excess of  per year 
these standards are more stringent than those currently in effect under the capital purchase program and the securities purchase agreement or those previously proposed by the treasury department 
however  it is still unclear how these standards will relate to the similar standards announced by the treasury department in the guidelines it issued on february   or whether the standards will be considered effective immediately or only after the treasury department adopts implementing regulations 
the decline in fair value of our stock could adversely affect our ability to raise capital  dilute current shareholders ownership or make it more expensive to raise capital 
the decline in the market prices of financial stocks in general  and our stock in particular  since january   could make it more expensive for us to raise capital in the public or private markets 
in many situations  our board of directors has the authority  without any vote of our shareholders  to issue shares of our authorized but unissued securities  including shares of common stock authorized and unissued under our stock option plans or additional shares of preferred stock 
in the future  we may issue additional securities  through public or private offerings  in order to raise additional capital 
any such issuance of common stock at current trading prices would significantly dilute the ownership of our current shareholders because we would have to issue more shares than if we had raised the same amount of capital when our share price was higher 
a decline in our performance could adversely impact our stock price and the level of interest in an equity offering making it more difficult or expensive to attract investors interest 
in the case of a debt offering  it could also result in a higher cost of funds  which could negatively impact our future earnings 
if we are unable to redeem the treasury preferred stock after five years  the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially 
if we do not redeem the treasury preferred stock prior to february   the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially on that date  from per annum to per annum 
depending on our financial condition at the time  this increase in the annual dividend rate on the treasury preferred stock could have a material negative effect on our liquidity 
the treasury preferred stock impacts net income available to holders of our common stock and earnings per share of our common stock  and the warrant we issued to the treasury department may be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
while the additional capital we raised through our participation in the treasury department s capital purchase program provides further funding to our business and we believe has improved investor perceptions with regard to our financial position  it has increased our equity and the number of actual and diluted outstanding shares of common stock as well as our preferred dividend requirements 
the dividends declared and the accretion of discount on the treasury preferred stock will reduce the net income available to holders of our common stock and our earnings per share 
the treasury preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of our liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant we issued to the treasury department in conjunction with the sale to the treasury department of the treasury preferred stock is exercised 
the common stock underlying the warrant represents approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of february  although the treasury department has agreed not to vote any of the common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets in which we operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
additionally  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
some of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
local or privately held community banking organizations in certain markets may price or structure their products in such a way that it makes it difficult for us to compete in those markets in a way that allows us to meet our profitability or credit goals 
any competitor may choose to offer pricing on loans and deposits that we think is irrational and choose to not compete with 
competitors may also be willing to extend credit without obtaining covenants or collateral and by offering weaker loan structures than we are willing to accept 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services  our reputation with consumers who reside in the markets we serve  the rate at which we introduce new products and services  customer satisfaction  and industry and general economic trends 
if we fail to perform in any of these areas  our competitive position and ability to retain market share or grow would be weakened  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and face legal risks 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect several areas  including our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  and requirements to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to our customers 
congress and federal agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation of statutes  regulations or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
additionally  the number of regulations we must comply with and the financial resources required to comply with those regulations has continually increased 
the cost of complying with these regulations makes it more difficult to remain competitive 
in light of current conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy  regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry 
most recently  government has intervened on an unprecedented scale in responding to the stresses experienced in the global financial markets 
some of the measures subject us and other institutions for which they were designed to additional restrictions  oversight or costs that may have an impact on our business  results of operations or the trading price of our common stock 
proposals for legislation that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry are expected to be introduced in the united states congress and in state legislatures 
the agencies regulating the financial services industry also frequently adopt changes to their regulations 
substantial regulatory and legislative initiatives  including a comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory system in the united states are possible in the years ahead 
we are unable to predict whether any of these initiatives will succeed  which form they will take  or whether any additional changes to statutes or regulations  including the interpretation or implementation thereof  will occur in the future 
any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
we regularly review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in fraud  operational or other losses that adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
fraud risks could include fraud by employees  vendors  customers or anyone we or our customers do business or come in contact with 
the holding company relies on dividends from integra bank for most of its revenue 
our holding company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
it receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from integra bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt 
federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to the holding company 
also  a holding company s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event integra bank is unable to pay dividends to the holding company  the holding company may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on its common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from integra bank could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our net loss has the consequence of not allowing  without the prior approval of the occ  integra bank to pay dividends to the parent company at present 
the liquidity section of this document within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides details on our plans to fund the parent s operations throughout potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 
we seek merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar  have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses  or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  changes in the national economy or in the markets in which we do business that reduce the anticipated benefits resulting from an acquisition  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  and difficulty in estimating the value of the target company 
we evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  if we fail to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits from an acquisition  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by us can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our local markets  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 

table of contents our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems  including risks to data integrity 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations

overview the impact of deteriorating economic conditions during significantly impacted the banking industry in terms of lower levels of earnings and stock prices  and declining credit quality 
during  we experienced significant increases in non performing assets and loan loss provisions 
our decline in credit quality impacted our operations during in the areas of net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest expense and a reversal of a state tax benefit 
our focus shifted during towards managing our credit  liquidity and capital positions 
the net loss for was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share in the results include goodwill impairment primarily related to the april acquisition of prairie financial corporation  of chicago  illinois of  a provision for loan losses of  other than temporary securities impairment of  and a state income tax valuation allowance of  results for included a provision for loan losses of  an other than temporary impairment charge of  and no goodwill impairment or state tax valuation allowance 
the net interest margin for was for  compared to in the increased provision for loan losses was primarily attributed to commercial real estate and construction land and development loans which represented of total non performing loans at december  the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs by  in the allowance to total loans was at december   while net charge offs totaled basis points for  compared to basis points for non performing loans were  or of total loans at december  compared to  or of total loans at december   while the allowance to non performing loans decreased from to for the same dates 
non performing assets increased to  compared to  at december  net interest income was  for  compared to  for  while the net interest margin was for  compared to in the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a higher level of non accrual loans throughout non interest income decreased  to  primarily driven by higher securities losses of  partially offset by increases in deposit service charges  debit card interchange and annuity income 
non interest expense increased  to  primarily due to goodwill impairment of  higher personnel expenses and loan collection costs and the impact of a full year of expense related to the prairie acquisition 
low cost deposit average balances  which include non interest checking  now and savings deposits  were  during the fourth quarter of  an increase of  or from the fourth quarter of commercial loan average balances were  in the fourth quarter of  an increase of  or from the fourth quarter of this included growth in commercial real estate of  or and commercial and industrial of  or 
direct consumer balances increased  or  while home equity loans increased  or 
at december   integra bank s ratios were above the regulatory minimum for well capitalized status 
integra bank corporation s capital ratios were within the regulatory requirements for being adequately capitalized 

table of contents the weakened housing market has stressed our loan portfolio  resulting in a higher provision for loan losses 
we executed adjustments to our strategic plan to take into account the current economic downturn  severe housing correction  and weak credit conditions 
we are focused on making sure we have adequate capital  liquidity and loan loss reserves to weather the current credit cycle 
to maximize capital  we adjusted our loan targets downward  especially in the area of commercial real estate 
the growth in our commercial real estate portfolio is attributable  in part  to the difficulties experienced in the permanent financing market 
as a result of the worsening credit markets  many of our borrowers have not been able to refinance their completed and stabilized projects on a permanent basis as expected 
accordingly  given the current environment and the continued difficulties in the permanent market  we determined that pursuing additional growth in our commercial real estate portfolio would not be prudent at this time 
starting in the third quarter of  we discontinued pursuing new commercial real estate opportunities  regardless of property type 
as expected our commercial real estate balances continued to grow in the short term as we worked through our remaining pipeline of pending loans and as we funded committed credit facilities 
that pipeline declined significantly during the fourth quarter of as this credit cycle continues  we will continue to evaluate the size of this portfolio 
on february   we entered into a letter agreement with the united states department of treasury  or treasury department  as part of the treasury department s capital purchase program established under the emergency economic stabilization act of  or eesa 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreement standard terms  or securities purchase agreement  attached to the letter agreement  we issued to the treasury department  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b  or treasury preferred stock  having a liquidation amount per share of  and a warrant  or warrant  to purchase up to  shares  or warrant shares  of our common stock  at an initial per share exercise price of  for an aggregate purchase price of  the treasury preferred stock pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and per year thereafter 
pursuant to the terms of the recently enacted american recovery and reinvestment act of  or arra  we may  upon prior consultation with the federal reserve  redeem the treasury preferred stock at any time 
upon full redemption of the treasury preferred stock  the treasury department will also liquidate the associated warrant in accordance with the arra and any rules and regulations thereunder 
the treasury preferred stock is generally non voting 
our plan for includes the following key priorities pursue opportunities to raise additional capital to maintain well capitalized status  and then begin the process of rebuilding capital levels to fortress levels  stabilize and then improve our credit profile as measured by non performing assets  return to profitability  then to future acceptable and sustainable profitability  grow core deposits faster than loans  and generate positive operating leverage revenue growth that exceeds expense growth 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for losses  and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on our assessment of several factors actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances  and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the section labeled credit management below provides additional information on this subject 
we consider loans impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
in measuring the market value of the collateral  we use assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 

table of contents changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience and the conditions of the various markets in which the collateral may be liquidated may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale and other real estate owned  as well as fair values associated with derivative financial instruments  intangible assets and the value of loan collateral when valuing loans 
these are all recorded at either market value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for securities available for sale are typically based on quoted market prices 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities or level values 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information on how we determine level values 
the fair values for loans held for sale are based upon quoted prices 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
if necessary  appraisals are updated to reflect changes in market conditions 
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated based on current market quotes 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we assessed goodwill for impairment quarterly during by applying a series of fair value based tests 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded goodwill impairment of  and  respectively 
impairment exists when the net book value of our one reporting unit exceeds its fair value and the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with an asset or liability 
core deposit intangibles are recorded at fair value based on a discounted cash model valuation at the time of acquisition and are evaluated periodically for impairment 
customer relationship intangibles utilize a method that discounts the cash flows related to future loan relationships that are expected to result from referrals from existing customers 
estimated cash flows are determined based on estimated future net interest income resulting from these relationships  less a provision for loan losses  non interest expense  income taxes and contributory asset charges 
other than temporary securities impairment declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are other than temporary are reflected as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary losses  we consider the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
for securities falling under eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  such as collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  and collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred when there is an adverse change in the expected cash flows principal or interest to be received and the fair value of the beneficial interest is less than its carrying amount 
in determining whether an adverse change in cash flows occurred during the first three quarters of  the present value of the remaining cash flows  as estimated at the initial transaction date or the last date previously revised  was compared to the present value of the expected cash flows at the current reporting date 
the estimated cash flows reflect those a market participant would use and were discounted at a rate equal to the current effective yield 
if an other than temporary impairment was recognized as a result of this analysis  the yield was changed to the market rate 
the last revised estimated cash flows were then used for future impairment analysis purposes 
in january   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb staff position no eitf 
this fsp substantially aligns the basis for determining impairment under eitf for determining impairment with the guidance found in paragraph of sfas no 
 which requires entities to assess whether it is probable that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms 
sfas no 
does not require exclusive reliance on market participant assumptions regarding future cash flows  permitting the use of reasonable management judgment of the probability that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
an assessment is made as to whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
tax credits are recorded as a reduction to tax provision in the period for which the credits may be utilized

tax exempt income  such as interest on loans and securities of state and political subdivisions  has been increased to an amount that would have been earned had such income been taxable 
net interest income for was  or higher than an increase in overall earning assets contributed positively to net interest income 
a higher level of non accrual loans offset this increase  as did the impact from reductions in interest rates  coupled with the inability to further reduce certain funding costs that have reached a floor 
earning asset yields decreased basis points in  compared to a basis point decrease in interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin was  compared to in major components of the change in net interest income from to are as follows average earning assets increased  or 
an increase in commercial loan average balances of  was slightly offset by lower residential mortgage loan average balances of  lower securities average balances of  and lower indirect consumer loan average balances of  the increase in commercial loan average balances was largely due to growth during  but also included a full year of the chicago region  while included approximately months of activity 
the change in the composition of earning assets was in line with our strategy throughout and most of to improve our mix of earning assets by reducing lower yielding securities  residential mortgage loan and indirect consumer loan balances and increasing the amount of higher yielding commercial loans 
the increase in average commercial loan balances for was driven by increases in commercial real estate loans of  and commercial and industrial loans of  the average rate of commercial loans decreased basis points  as libor and prime rates declined throughout and the level of non accrual loans increased 
our asset sensitivity meaning that a change in prevailing interest rates impacts our assets more quickly than our liabilities  resulted in our asset yields declining faster and more than the cost of the liabilities funding those assets 
approximately of our variable rate loans are tied to prime  to a libor index and to other floating rate indexes 
prime decreased basis points during  while one month and three month libor rates decreased and basis points  respectively 
the impact of non accrual loans on the net interest margin was basis points  or approximately cents of earnings per share 
approximately half of the basis point decline in the margin during the fourth quarter of was due to the increased level of non performing loans 
non accruing interest for loans in non accrual status at december  approximated basis points 
the impact to our net interest margin from the higher percentage of commercial loans positively impacted our net interest margin for the first months of  but then negatively impacted it later in the year when prime and libor rates declined 
total average commercial loans represented of total earning assets for  up from for the yield on commercial loans for the fourth quarter of was basis points lower than the yield on securities during the fourth quarter of  a basis point change from the fourth quarter of  when commercial loan yields were basis points higher than more stable securities yields

increases in the average balances of commercial loans of  more than offset planned declines in residential mortgage loans of  indirect consumer loans of  and securities of  this change in the composition of earning assets was in line with our previous strategy of improving our mix of earning assets by reducing lower yielding securities  residential mortgage loan and indirect consumer loan balances and increasing the amount of higher yielding commercial loans 
the increase in average commercial loan balances for was driven by increases in commercial real estate loans of  and also from loans originated by our commercial lending group located in cincinnati  ohio 
average balances for this group increased  the average rate of commercial loans increased basis points  as yields continued to reflect consistent increases for most of the year in market interest rates  which resulted in changes to our pricing for new loans and upward interest rate adjustments on existing variable rate products 
this trend reversed during the fourth quarter for variable rate loans tied to prime rate indexes  as well as for new originations

we regularly review the composition of our securities portfolio  taking into account market risks  the current and expected interest rate environment  liquidity needs  and our overall interest rate risk profile and strategic goals 

table of contents on a quarterly basis  we evaluate each security in our portfolio with an individual unrealized loss to determine if that loss represents other than temporary impairment 
the factors we consider in evaluating the securities include whether the securities were guaranteed by the us government or its agencies and the securities public ratings  if available  and how those two factors affect credit quality and recovery of the full principal balance  the relationship of the unrealized losses to increases in market interest rates  the length of time the securities have had temporary impairment  and our ability to hold the securities for the time necessary to recover the amortized cost 
we also review the payment performance  delinquency history and credit support of the underlying collateral for certain securities in our portfolio as part of our impairment analysis and review 
during the second quarter of  we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of  on two trust preferred securities 
trust preferred securities consisted of six pooled collateralized debt obligations cdos and five single name issues at both june  and december  the unrealized losses on cdos were separately evaluated at june  under eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets 
the decline in values of trust preferred securities during is the result of the widening in market spreads that many sectors of the market have experienced during this period of unprecedented market disruption 
furthermore  a majority of the underlying issuers of these cdos are financial institutions  and three of our pooled issues include insurance companies and real estate investment trusts reits 
at december   net unrealized losses for our securities portfolio totaled  after recognition of a fourth quarter other than temporary impairment charge of  with  of this amount coming from the trust preferred securities portfolio 
the other than temporary charge recognized during the second quarter of was concentrated in two trust preferred securities 
the first of these two securities  a trapeza bond  in which we had invested in the d tranche  had a interest deferral and default rate  failed the overcollateralization test and was rated bb by fitch  with a negative watch 
the two trust preferred securities we took an other than temporary impairment charge for during the second quarter included the highest percentage of non financial institution issuers  and given the unfavorable real estate market  obligations of reits were an increasing credit concern 
the july  default of indymac  one of the participants in trapeza  as well as the previous default of american homebuilders  were key factors in our consideration of whether this security had experienced other than temporary impairment at june  indymac represented approximately  or and america homebuilders defaulted for  of the collateral for the security 
in addition  the current fair value declined to of book value  and we expected future disruptions in cash flows because of these defaults 
as a result  we determined that this security met the definition of other than temporarily impaired at june   and recorded an impairment charge of  the second of the securities was an alesco a bond  in which we invested in the c tranche 
this security was experiencing a interest deferral rate  failed the overcollateralization test at june   and was rated a by fitch  with a negative watch 
the july  default of indymac  one of the participants in the alesco bond  was a key factor in our consideration of whether this security had experienced other than temporary impairment at june  indymac represented approximately  or of the total amount of the collateral for this security 
the fair value  at june  had declined to of book value  and we expected future disruptions in cash flows because of the default 
we also determined that this security met the definition of other than temporarily impaired and recorded an impairment charge of in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position no eitf 
this fsp replaces the cash flow analysis required in eitf for determining impairment with the guidance found in paragraph of sfas no 
 which requires entities to assess whether it is probable that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms 
sfas no 
does not require exclusive reliance on market participant assumptions regarding future cash flows  permitting the use of reasonable management judgment of the probability that the holder will be unable to collect all amounts due 
we incorporated several factors into our determination of whether the trust preferred securities in our portfolio had incurred other than temporary impairment  including current defaults and deferrals  the likelihood that a deferring issuer will reinstate  recovery assumptions on defaulted issuers  expectations for future defaults and deferrals  structural support within the securities and the coupon rate at the issuer level compared to the coupon on the tranche  among others 
in evaluating these factors we examined the trustee reports to determine current payment history and the structural support that existed within the securities at december  upon completion of this analysis  we determined that we should recognize other than temporary impairment on three securities 
for those securities  we engaged an outside firm to utilize monte carlo simulations to model future deferrals and defaults and coupon rates based on the current swap curve to project future cash flows within the waterfall structure 
additionally  we used that modeling to determine the loss distribution at different percentiles  considering results at the th percentile as probable 
this analysis was modeled using the cash flows for each issuer and in turn for the tranches that we own for the probability of and the timing of defaults  discounting the cash flows back using a risk neutral rate  adjusted for a liquidity spread 
market risk is captured in the model on an issuer basis as a function of both volatility and excess returns and credit risk is captured as a probability of default 

table of contents the alesco bond was downgraded by moody s in august to baa a grade considered investment grade by moody s  with two lower grades still in the investment grade category  and had one additional deferral and three additional defaults during the third and fourth quarters  and had no securities subordinate to the tranche we were invested in 
the results of our modeling at december  indicated that there was additional other than temporary impairment of we recognized that impairment during the fourth quarter of we recognized other than temporary impairment on two other bonds 
the first of these two bonds is a trapeza bond  in which we had invested in the d tranche 
this bond had experienced two defaults and three deferrals as of december   with one of those deferrals occurring in the third quarter of the bond was rated a by fitch at december  and had  of securities subordinate to the tranche we were invested in 
that amount assumes no cash is collected from all issuers currently in deferral or default 
it also does not consider the potential impact the treasury capital purchase program may have on financial institution issuers involved in the trust preferred issue that may be or have been approved for funds in we recorded  of other than temporary impairment at december  to reduce the fair value of this bond to  the second bond is a us capital funding v bond  in which we had invested in the b tranche 
this bond had experienced two defaults and three deferrals as of december   with one of those defaults occurring in the third quarter of the bond was rated a by moodys and a by fitch at december  and had  of securities subordinate to the tranche we were invested in 
we recorded  of other than temporary impairment at december  to reduce the fair value of this bond to  the trapeza bond s fitch rating did not change during the third or fourth quarters of  and the results of our modeling indicated that the fair value had increased  since june  during the third and fourth quarters of  the trapeza bond had two additional defaults 
at december   the trapeza bond had  of securities subordinate to the tranche we were invested in 
we also review financial information for our trust preferred securities on the companies who were on the borrowing side of these transactions 
for the financial institutions involved  we review financial data that includes earnings  capital  net charge offs and non performing assets  as well as the overall financial trends of the issuers 
based on the latest trustee reports  discussions with underwriters  review of third party analysis of the trust preferred portfolio  review of underlying financial information such as ratings  deferrals and defaults  as well as review of projected cash flows  we believe that no adverse change in estimated cash flows occurred during the fourth quarter outside of the alesco  trapeza and us capital funding securities mentioned above and anticipate no additional interruption of cash flows 
each of the four securities we have taken other than temporary impairment on remains classified as available for sale at december  during the third quarter of  we sold  shares of mastercard class b common stock for  by converting those shares to class a shares and then selling them through a voluntary program offered by mastercard incorporated 
we received these shares in as a result of mastercard s public offering 
prior to the third quarter of  these shares did not have a readily determinable fair value and were carried at cost 
on september   we sold securities with a book value of  for  resulting in a loss on the sale of prior to this sale  we had the ability and the intention to hold all of our securities that had a fair value below cost until maturity 
in the third quarter of  we conducted a comprehensive review of our securities available for sale portfolio 
the review was the result of the changing economic landscape from recent events surrounding the mortgage industry  recent statements and actions by the federal open market committee in particular  the decision to lower the fed funds target rate in mid september  and our desire to reposition the securities portfolio liquidity  interest rate risk  and earnings over the long term 
the sale of these securities and purchase of  of new securities helped ensure that our overall interest rate risk position stayed within policy requirements of our capital markets risk policy which considers our ability to fund our liabilities  the duration of our loan portfolio and the model or target duration of our asset mix 
the loss recognized during the third quarter of was solely due to interest rates  it was expected that the securities would have fully recovered their value if held to maturity 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a  pre tax charge for an other than temporary impairment related to two federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac perpetual preferred securities 
we sold these securities during the second quarter of 
table of contents regulatory stock regulatory stock includes mandatory equity securities which do not have a readily determinable fair value and are therefore carried at cost on the balance sheet

the growth came primarily from commitments made prior to the fourth quarter of commercial and industrial  or c i  loan average balances increased  or annualized 
our non owner occupied commercial real estate  or cre portfolio is managed by three areas  with  managed by our commercial real estate team headquartered in cincinnati  ohio  our cre line of business   managed by our chicago region and the remainder managed in our other markets 
our largest property type concentration is in retail projects at  or  of the total cre portfolio  which includes direct loans or participations in larger loans primarily for stand alone retail buildings for large national or regional retailers such as walgreens  sherwin williams and advance auto and for regional shopping centers with national and regional tenants

the three largest concentrations outside of our core market states are  or located in florida   or located in georgia and  or  located in nevada 
non owner occupied cre non performing loans in our core market states of indiana  kentucky  illinois and ohio totaled  at december  with another  located in florida   located in north carolina and none in nevada 
a total of  of our non performing loans at december   were located in south carolina  in which we had  of loans outstanding 
the majority of projects located outside of indiana  kentucky  illinois and ohio are with developers located in or with a major presence in our four state area that have developed or are developing properties in other states 
we do not execute non recourse financing 
the growth in our cre portfolio  coupled with the planned decline in our indirect consumer and residential mortgage loan portfolio  has increased our level of concentration risk 
the balance in our non owner occupied cre portfolio increased from  or of the total loan portfolio at december   to  or of the total portfolio at december  the bulk of the increase consists primarily of construction loans to experienced national and regional developers 
in addition  the continued growth of our cre line of business  coupled with our middle market c i business based in cincinnati and our chicago region added in april  has increased our number of relationships with total exposure in excess of  from december  to december   the number of relationships with total exposure in excess of  has increased from relationships  or  in commitments  to relationships  or  in commitments 

table of contents the majority of the increase results from our cre group which pursues a strategy of serving high quality  experienced national and regional developers 
typically  these loans are for construction projects with anticipated construction periods of three years or less 
retail has been the predominant property type with many of the projects pre leased to well known national companies 
to date  problems experienced by this group have been principally limited to residential construction and development 
in addition  a portion of the increase in larger relationships is tied to our cincinnati based c i business 
this business  which began in may  is comprised of a team of lenders hired from a large  super regional bank with many combined years of middle market lending experience and long standing relationships with most of their clients 
also  we require a high level of approval authority for larger relationships 
currently  any new relationship in excess of  specifically requires the approval of the chief executive officer and the chief credit and risk officer 
finally  in august  we amended our loan policy with respect to large borrower concentrations by decreasing our maximum exposure guidelines 
during the fourth quarter of  we did not add any new relationships with commitments in excess of  the growth in our cre portfolio is attributable  in part  to the difficulties experienced in the permanent financing market 
these difficulties  which began in and continued through  have made it more difficult for many of our borrowers to refinance their completed and stabilized projects on a permanent basis as expected 
accordingly  given the current environment and the continued difficulties in the permanent market  we determined that pursuing additional growth in our cre portfolio would not be prudent 
accordingly  during the third quarter of  we discontinued pursuing new cre opportunities  regardless of property type 
our cre balances will likely continue to grow in the short term  however  as we fund against committed credit facilities 
as this credit cycle unfolds  we will continue to evaluate the size of this portfolio 
cre loan balances in chicago  which is where most of our non performing loans have originated  were  at december  compared to  at december  c i loans increased  or  from year end the net increase was due in part to an increase in the outstanding balance of loans originated by our cincinnati  ohio  based commercial lending team and from loans to customers located in our community markets  primarily in evansville  indiana  and its surrounding areas 
the acquisition of prairie did not have an impact on this portfolio  as their commercial portfolio was largely concentrated in commercial real estate 
residential mortgage loans decreased  or  from year end we expect the balance of residential mortgage loans will continue to decline during  since we sell substantially all originations to a private label provider on a servicing released basis 
we evaluate our counterparty risk with this provider on a quarterly basis by evaluating their financial results and the potential impact to our relationship with them of any declines in financial performance 
if we were unable to sell loans to this provider  we would seek an alternate provider and record new loans on our balance sheet until one was found  impacting both our liquidity and our interest rate risk 
we have never had a strategy of originating subprime or alt a mortgages  option adjustable rate mortgages or any other exotic mortgage products 
the impact of private mortgage insurance is not material to our determination of loss factors within the allowance for loan losses for the residential mortgage portfolio 
loans with private mortgage insurance comprise only a portion of our portfolio and the coverage amount typically does not exceed of the loan balance 
home equity lines of credit  or heloc loans increased  or  at december   from year end heloc loans are generally collateralized by a second mortgage on the customer s primary residence 
heloc loan average balances increased  or from consumer loans  which include both direct and indirect loans  decreased  or at december   from year end the average balance of indirect consumer loans declined  or during  as we exited this line of business in december in order to originate higher yielding commercial loans 
the indirect loans are to borrowers located primarily in the midwest and are generally secured by recreational vehicle or marine assets 
indirect loans at december   were  compared to  at december  the average balance of direct consumer loans increased  or during loans delinquent days were  or of our portfolio at december   an increase of  from september  delinquent loans include  of cre loans  or of that portfolio   of c i loans  or of that portfolio   of residential mortgage loans  or of that portfolio  and  of consumer and home equity loans  or of that portfolio 
of the  of cre loans   or  are located in the chicago region 
the increasing level of delinquency in the chicago we experienced during reflected the downturn in the chicago market 
as the sale of new homes in chicago continues to be weak  our borrowers are having difficulty in maintaining their loans on a current basis 
we expect that delinquency levels in chicago will remain high and could increase until the chicago market improves

nonaccrual loans are loans on which we have suspended recognizing interest because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest according to the terms of the contract 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question or when we determine the loan is impaired 
loans which are less than days past due  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position 
loans days or more past due  which totaled at december   are loans that are continuing to accrue interest  but which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments

the increase in non performing loans and other real estate owned is primarily due to the housing downturn that began in and continued through  affecting not only residential mortgage lending  but also commercial real estate lending related to residential construction 
in the fourth quarter of  we continued to experience a decline in credit quality  primarily limited to residential construction and development  although we did begin to experience some decline in other portfolios as macro factors continued to deteriorate in the economy 
since we do not underwrite a subprime product  the performance of our residential mortgage portfolio continues to be acceptable

a loan to an unaffiliated financial institution  discussed below  represented of our non performing c i loans at december  as previously disclosed  we extended a  secured line of credit to peoples which matured on june  the balance at december  was  interest was paid current through december  the line of credit is secured by a pledge of all of the outstanding stock of peoples savings association subsidiary 
peoples primary federal regulator has prohibited its savings association subsidiary from paying cash dividends to the holding company without prior consent of such regulator 
as a result  the borrower is currently limited to existing cash and cash equivalents for liquidity at the holding company level 
the savings association subsidiary is considered well capitalized under regulatory requirements  with tangible capital of  at december  as a result of its condition  peoples began actively pursuing a transaction which  if consummated  would have resulted in the line of credit being paid in full 
in july  we entered into a short term forbearance agreement to allow peoples time to enter into a definitive agreement and obtain necessary approvals for such a transaction 
in september  peoples announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with another bank and a private hedge fund for a sale transaction that was subject to regulatory and shareholder approval 
in december  one of the buying parties exercised its right to terminate the agreement 
since then  peoples has been working with its investment banker to locate another buyer or an alternative transaction 
we extended the forbearance agreement through january  to facilitate peoples efforts 
at this date  peoples has not been successful in locating another buyer or transaction and the forbearance agreement has expired 
we continue to believe that a sale of peoples or its savings association subsidiary or another or alternative transaction is possible and that the value of the savings association subsidiary exceeds the amount owed to us 
due to the uncertainty of these circumstances  we placed the line of credit in nonaccrual status at december  and established a specific reserve for this credit in our allowance for loan losses 
we continue to monitor the situation closely 
however  there can be no assurance that the loan will be paid in full  or  if the loan is not paid as anticipated  that the parties will reach agreement on an acceptable resolution 
at december   the peoples line of credit was our largest non performing loan 
the second largest non performing loan is to a louisville  kentucky area builder for a condominium project near hilton head  south carolina 
the outstanding balance of this loan  after a charge off of  was  at year end  while the total amount of all outstanding loans to this borrower was  this project has not performed as expected and we are pursuing collection 
the third largest non performing loan has a balance of  at year end and is secured by a condominium project in panama city  florida 
like many florida projects  sales in this project have been slow 
we recognized charge offs totaling  against this loan in the third and fourth quarters of the fourth largest non performing loan at december  has an outstanding balance of  and is secured by a residential development and adjacent land in the chicago area 
the majority of the remainder of our commercial non performing loans are secured by one or more residential properties in the chicago area  typically at an or less loan to value ratio at inception 
the chicago residential real estate market has continued to experience less sales activity than we originally anticipated 
however  while the chicago market has experienced a decline in housing prices  according to published data  to date the decline seems to be limited  when compared to certain other areas of the united states 
the case schiller index of residential housing values shows a decline in the value of chicago single family residential properties of from the peak of the index in september to the most recent index for december  as published in february the zillow index for the fourth quarter of shows a decline of from its peak during the second quarter of on a year over year basis  the zillow index shows a decline of for all homes  with a decline for single family housing and a decline for condominiums 
information gained by us by reviewing new appraisals for existing loans has been consistent generally with the declines indicated by the case schiller and zillow indices 
since april  we have obtained new appraisals on of our non performing loans in chicago  with obtained during the fourth quarter 
further  we believe the overall demand for housing in chicago has been relatively low 
many potential buyers are choosing to rent rather than buy at this time  with market information indicating an increase in rental demand and rental rates 
should sales levels in chicago remain stable at their current values or continue to decline in  there is risk that we would experience further deterioration

the amount of interest that would have been earned had these nonaccrual loans remained in accruing status was  and for  and  respectively 
we maintain a watch list of commercial loans and review those loans quarterly 
for the most part  loans are designated as watch list loans to ensure more frequent monitoring 
the assets are reviewed to ensure proper earning status and management strategy 
if we determine that there is serious doubt as to performance in accordance with the original terms of the contract then the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
we also review nonaccrual loans on an ongoing basis 
credit management our credit management procedures include board oversight of the lending function by the board s credit and risk management committee  which meets at least quarterly 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  non performing loans and assets  problem and watch list loans and charge offs 
the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  including collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending and other pertinent matters and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for the current lending environment 
in addition  a sample of loans is reviewed by an independent loan review department or outside independent third party  as well as by a compliance department and regulatory agencies 
consumer  mortgage and small business loans are centrally underwritten and approved while commercial loans are approved through a combination of limited individual lending authorities  independent senior credit officers  the chief credit and risk officer and the chief executive officer 
a limited number of officers have the authority  in certain cases and for certain loan types  to override centrally denied loan requests 
those overrides must meet certain conditions and are centrally tracked and monitored for performance 
new relationships in excess of  require the approval of both the chief credit and risk officer and the chief executive officer 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount that  in our opinion  is adequate to absorb probable incurred loan losses as determined by our ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the loan portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  loss data over an extended period of time  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  industry concentrations  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and current economic conditions 
we charge off loans that we deem uncollectible to the allowance  and credit recoveries of previously charged off amounts to the allowance 
we charge a provision for loan losses against earnings at levels we believe are necessary to assure that the allowance can absorb probable losses 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for commercial loans is based on a review of specific loans as well as delinquency  classification levels and historic charge offs for pools of non reviewed loans 
for consumer loans  the allocated component is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 

table of contents an annual review of selected loans  based on size  is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with the relationship manager responsible for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented by the loan review area  which provides information assisting in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on our estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to us 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
we consider loans impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based  for all collateral dependent loans  on the market value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
for non collateral dependent loans  the allowance is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios  based on the net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in our geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance covers general economic uncertainties as well as the imprecision inherent in any forecasting methodology 
at december   the unallocated reserve included within the allowance for loan losses was  as compared to at december  the unallocated portion of the allowance increased at december  for two reasons 
the first was to reflect the pace of change and unpredictability of the current economic environment and how it could affect our estimate of losses 
the second is to provide for those loans which are collateral dependent in terms of potential additional collateral stress  given the continued declines in the market value of real estate collateral across our lending footprint 
the factors used to evaluate homogenous loans in accordance with the sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly and are updated as conditions warrant 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by our periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis and presented to the credit and risk management committee of the board of directors for review  and to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are significant policies that involve the use of estimates and a high degree of subjectivity 
we have developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk after careful consideration of known relevant facts 
in developing this assessment  we rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries or issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
our process to perform this analysis includes expanded data analysis  back testing and ongoing refinements to documentation surrounding the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance provides reliable measures of the probability of default and risk of loss for our categories of loans with similar risk characteristics and analyzes loss data over the period of time that we believe is appropriate when coupled with management adjustments we apply towards that data 
the appropriateness of management adjustments is considered in terms of market conditions  portfolio performance and portfolio concentrations 
in considering market conditions  we review a variety of information including unemployment statistics  foreclosure rates and housing statistics from third party indices and reports 
we believe this improves the measure of inherent loss over a complete economic cycle and reduces the impact for qualitative adjustments 
this process does not impact losses estimated in accordance with sfas the allowance for loan losses was  at december   representing of total loans  compared to  at september   or of total loans and  at december   or of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans ratio was at december   compared to at september  and at december  we do not target specific allowance to total loans or allowance to non performing loan percentages when determining the adequacy of the allowance  but we do consider and evaluate the factors that go into making that determination 
at december   we believe that our allowance appropriately considers the expected loss in our non performing loans 
the provision for loan losses was  for the three months ended december   and  for the twelve months ended december  this compares to  and  for the three and twelve months ended december  
table of contents the provision for loan losses exceeded net charge offs by  during the fourth quarter of annualized net charge offs to average loans were for the quarter  compared to for the fourth quarter of  and for the twelve months ended december  for the fourth quarter of  net charge offs included  of cre   of commercial  of residential mortgage  of indirect consumer loan and of checking account net charge offs  while the remaining came from various other loan categories 
cre net charge offs during the fourth quarter of included  and  for two condominium projects in chicago   for a residential development and land loan in chicago and  for a condominium project in hilton head  south carolina being developed by a louisville  kentucky based developer 
for  net charge offs included  of cre   of commercial   of indirect consumer loans   of checking accounts and  of residential mortgage net charge offs while the remaining  came from various other loan categories 
given the current unprecedented economic conditions  we continue to take several steps to improve our credit management processes  including the following during  we obtained new appraisals covering approximately of the properties securing our chicago area non performing loans and we used those appraisals to help determine the need for and amount of specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses 
since april  we have obtained new appraisals on approximately of the properties securing our chicago area non performing loans 
we plan to continue to order new or updated appraisals for any commercial real estate loans that warrant it as this cycle continues 
we are directing our chicago lending staff to manage non performing loans in their portfolio and have hired additional personnel to assist with managing the more troubled relationships 
we discontinued pursuing new cre opportunities  regardless of property type  starting in the third quarter 
we expect our cre balances will continue to grow in the short term  however  as we fund committed credit facilities 
as this credit cycle unfolds  we will continue to evaluate the size of this portfolio 
we have instituted a new additional portfolio review process in which relationship managers are required to present selected loans in their portfolio to credit administration and executive management 
the loans to be presented are selected by credit administration based upon a number of factors  including the size and age of the loan  product type  industry type and delinquency 
we have implemented other policy and process changes  including actions to reduce our concentration risk as well as tightening our loan approval standards and processes

any modifications could adversely affect our profitability and capital levels over the near term  but would be undertaken if we believe that restructuring the balance sheet will improve our interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile on a longer term basis 
at december   we were not in compliance with two financial covenants in the agreement for our  unsecured term loan and  short term line of credit

as long as the senior preferred shares we issued under the capital purchase program are outstanding  we will not be able to increase the quarterly dividend without the prior consent of the treasury department 
the amount of cash dividends we pay directly affects our capital levels 
we expect to continue building capital through earnings retention until there is clear improvement in the credit cycle and economy 
the average equity to average asset ratio was and for and  respectively 
we opened a new banking center in union  kentucky in at december   we had no future contractual commitments related to construction of new banking centers 
during the first quarter of  we sold three banking offices located in georgetown and lexington  kentucky and two banking offices in lawrenceburg  kentucky  for a total gain of approximately  the banking industry is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices 
at december  and  we and integra bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and integra bank met the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
see additional discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our strategy for maintaining or increasing capital  include the following improving and retaining our level of earnings  reducing cre lending  we may also sell non core assets to reduce the size of our balance sheet  issuing new capital in an opportunistic basis as we feel necessary and as conditions warrant  and delevering through the sales of loans and securities 
during the third quarter of  we filed a registration statement relating to equity securities with the securities and exchange commission to be issued through a shelf registration process  increasing our ability to respond quickly to capital raising opportunities that may occur in the future 
during the fourth quarter of  we applied for inclusion in the capital purchase program established by the treasury department 
on february   we completed a transaction in which the treasury department invested  in exchange for senior preferred stock and a related warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
the senior preferred stock bears a five percent dividend for each of the first five years of the investment  and nine percent thereafter  unless the shares are redeemed 
the shares are callable at par at any time subject to prior consultation with the federal reserve 
the impact of the receipt of the  in funding is expected to increase our regulatory capital ratios by approximately to basis points 
the impact on integra bank s ratios will depend on how those funds are deployed 
the actual impact to our and integra bank s capital ratios depends on the actual use of the funds and the impact on total risk weighted assets and regulatory capital 
capital trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier capital for the parent holding company under federal reserve guidelines 
as a result of the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
 the federal reserve adopted a rule that allows the limited inclusion of trust preferred securities in tier capital  subject to stricter qualitative limits 

table of contents liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to fund existing commitments  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and other borrowings 
we continuously monitor our current and prospective business activity in order to design maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments that are in line with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
for the bank  the primary sources of short term asset liquidity have been cash  federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  and securities available for sale 
in addition to these sources  short term asset liquidity is provided by scheduled principal paydowns and maturing loans and securities 
the balance between these sources and the need to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under our capital markets risk policy 
when these sources are not adequate  we may use the taf  brokered deposits  repurchase agreements or federal funds 
we may also sell investment securities  utilize the bank s borrowing capacity with the fhlb  or secure funding utilizing the provisions of the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program s debt guarantee program as alternative sources of liquidity 
at december  and  respectively  federal funds sold and other short term investments were and  additionally  at december   we had  available from unused  uncommitted federal funds lines and in excess of  in unencumbered securities available for repurchase agreements or liquidation 
the bank also has a borrower in custody line with the federal reserve bank totaling over  as part of its liquidity contingency plan 
during the second half of  the financial markets experienced unprecedented volatility as the interbank markets were severely disrupted and federal funds rates varied widely intraday 
the actions taken by the treasury department and the fdic have improved the performance of these markets and liquidity 
banking customers concern regarding deposit safety has caused increased deposit volatility 
again  actions by the fdic  in particular increases in insurance coverage  appear to have reduced the level of anxiety 
we have seen other financial institutions pay above market rates for funds  particularly term certificates of deposit  in some of the markets in which we operate  particularly in southern indiana and northern kentucky 
in light of these conditions  we significantly increased our use of the brokered certificate of deposit markets to diversify our sources of funding  obtained longer term funding and improved pricing at certain terms given local market pricing pressure 
we have also utilized the taf  a source of short term funding to assist with short term liquidity needs 
our liquidity at the holding company level is provided by dividends from the bank  cash balances  credit line availability  liquid assets  and proceeds from capital market transactions 
federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that national banks can make to their holding companies without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
a national bank s dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors  including the amount of its net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and net profits for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration 
because of the net loss  we are currently required to obtain advance approval from the bank s primary regulator prior to paying a dividend to our parent company 
should we make such a request  no assurance can be given that it would be approved 
as a participant in the capital purchase program  we cannot increase our current quarterly dividend of per share without the prior consent of the treasury department until the treasury preferred stock has been redeemed in full 
our liquidity is required to support operational expenses  pay taxes  meet outstanding debt and trust preferred securities obligations  provide dividends to shareholders  and other general corporate purposes 
we believe that funds necessary to meet our liquidity needs will be available from cash and securities  our line of credit  or other sources that we expect to be available during the year 
in february  we were approved to participate in the us treasury department s capital purchase program and received funding of  in exchange for shares of a new series of senior preferred stock and a related warrant to purchase common stock on the standard terms and conditions of the program 
the treasury preferred stock bears a five percent dividend for each of the first five years of the investment  and nine percent thereafter  unless the shares are redeemed 
the shares are callable at par at any time subject to prior consultation with the federal reserve and may be repurchased at any time under certain conditions 
the treasury department also received a year warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
as part of this program  we were required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity issued under the capital purchase program 
see participation in capital purchase program  in the regulation and supervision section of this document for further details about those standards 
accounting changes for information regarding accounting standards issued which will be adopted in future periods  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest sensitive income and expense levels 
interest rate changes affect the market value of capital by altering the underlying value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
our interest rate risk management program is comprised of several components 
the components include board of directors oversight  senior management oversight  risk limits and control  risk identification and measurement  risk monitoring and reporting and independent review 
the objective of our interest rate risk management processes is to manage the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and capital 
our interest rate risk is managed through the corporate asset and liability committee corporate alco with oversight through the alco and finance committee of the board of directors board alco 
the board alco meets at least twice a quarter and is responsible for the establishment of policies  risk limits and authorization levels 
the corporate alco meets at least quarterly and is responsible for implementing policies and procedures  overseeing the entire interest rate risk management process and establishing internal controls 
we measure and monitor interest rate risk on a proactive basis by utilizing a simulation model 
the model is externally validated periodically by an independent third party 
we use the following key methodologies to measure interest rate risk 
earnings at risk ear 
we consider ear to be our best measure for managing short term interest rate risk one year time frame 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net interest income that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we use a simulation model to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month horizon by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve and changes in basis relationships 
additional simulations are run from time to time to assess the risk to earnings and liquidity from balance sheet growth occurring faster or slower than anticipated as well as the impact of faster or slower prepayments in the loan and securities portfolios 
this simulation model projects the net interest income under each scenario and calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in one year ear from the base interest rate scenario of minus percent to a basis point rate shock in either direction 
at december   we would experience a negative change in ear  if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  we would experience a positive change in net interest income 
because current rates are near historically low levels  it is remote that rates could decline basis points 
therefore  this scenario has minimal meaning and we have chosen to evaluate the impact in a downward basis point rate shock to evaluate our risk 
ear in the downward basis point scenario was at december  versus at december  the change is primarily driven by the absolute low level of rates on december  many short term market rates were under at december   and would not experience a full basis point reduction in the most recent income scenarios 
this has a detrimental impact on ear as a basis point cut in the rate on income producing prime loans would not be accompanied by an offsetting reduction in the funding costs from fed funds or other short term funding sources 
in addition  many deposit rates are at floor levels and would provide no additional relief in a declining rate scenario 
the simulation for the upward bp scenario is well within the policy limits established by the board alco 
the positive change in ear in the scenario from to primarily results from the year over year increase in variable rate commercial loans  a sharp decrease in the volume of retail cds renewing in the first six months of versus and a shift in the mix of deposits from money market products to more stable rate savings products 
trends in earnings at risk estimated change in ear from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points basis points december  december  
table of contents economic value of equity eve 
we consider eve to be our best analytical tool for measuring long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
we use a simulation model to evaluate the impact of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on eve by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
this simulation model projects multiple rate paths under each rate scenario and projects the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities for each scenario 
the difference between the economic value of total assets and the economic value of total liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity 
the simulation model calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in eve 
the variance limit for eve is measured in an environment when the base interest rate scenario is shocked up or down basis points with a limit of minus 
at december   we would experience a negative change in eve if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  we would experience a positive change in eve 
both of these measures are within board approved policy limits 
again  as a basis point reduction in rates currently has minimal meaning  we have chosen to evaluate the impact in a downward basis point rate shock to evaluate our risk 
eve risk in the downward basis point scenario fell to negative at december  versus a positive for december  with the absolute low level of rates as the most significant driver in the year over year change 
the year over year improvement in the scenario largely resulted from a change in the mix of assets as variable rate commercial loans grew in volume while fixed rate commercial loans  mortgage loans and predominantly fixed rate securities all declined 
trends in economic value of equity estimated change in eve from the base interest rate scenario basis points basis points basis points december  december  the assumptions in any of these simulation runs are inherently uncertain 
any simulation cannot precisely estimate net interest income or economic value of the assets and liabilities or predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or on the economic value of the assets and liabilities 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies
