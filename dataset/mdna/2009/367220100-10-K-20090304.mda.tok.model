table of contents overview gasco is a natural gas and petroleum exploitation  development and production company engaged in locating and developing hydrocarbon prospects  primarily in the rocky mountain region 
our business strategy is to enhance shareholder value by using technologies new to a specific area to generate and develop high potential exploitation resources in this area 
our principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights  either directly or indirectly  and the exploitation and development of properties subject to those leases 
we are currently focusing our drilling efforts in the riverbend project located in the unita basin of northeastern utah  targeting the wasatch  mesaverde  blackhawk  mancos  dakota and morrison formations 
the operations of brek are included in our results of operations for all periods subsequent to december  recent developments impact of current credit markets and commodity prices the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
during the fourth quarter of  the severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity had significant adverse impacts on stock markets and oil and gas related commodity prices  which contributed to a significant decline in the our stock price and are expected to negatively impact our future liquidity 
the following discussion outlines the potential impacts that the current credit markets and commodity prices could have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
reduced cash flows from operations could impact our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet working capital needs oil and gas prices have declined significantly since historic highs in july and continue to decline since the end of the year 
further  the decline in commodity prices has outpaced the decline in the prices of goods and services that we use to drill  complete and operate our wells  reducing our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices on our cash flows  we have entered into commodity derivative instruments for and see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in the event that commodity prices stay depressed or decline further  our cash flows from operations would be reduced even taking into account our commodity derivative instruments for and may not be sufficient when coupled with available capacity under our million credit agreement the credit agreement to meet our working capital needs or fund our initial capital expenditure budget 
this could cause us to alter our business plans  including reducing our exploration and development plans 
given the decline in commodity prices and the weak global economic projections for  the board of directors approved a revised capital budget of  based on current 
table of contents expectations  we intend to fund our budget entirely through cash flow from operations 
consequently  we will monitor spending and cash flow throughout the year and may accelerate or delay investment depending on commodity prices  cash flow expectations and changes in our borrowing capacity 
at year end we were operating a single drilling rig 
this rig was released in late february  which will significantly reduce our fixed commitments in and in subsequent periods 
at rig release  we were obligated to pay the rig contractor approximately million for early termination of the drilling contract as calculated at  day from rig release through march   the expiration date of the contract 
additionally  as we plan to drill only two gross net new wells during  we reclassified approximately  and  of expiring acreage primarily in utah and california  respectively into proved property 
this reclassification represents the value of the leases that will expire during before we are able to develop them further 
our operational plans for will focus on those limited completion and recompletion projects that we believe will generate and lay the foundation for production growth 
through our actions such as reducing our capital expenditure budget  investing our cash balances conservatively and releasing our single drilling rig from operation  we believe that we have adequate liquidity from our expected cash flow and available credit to continue our operations through furthermore  we remain focused on our goal of divesting non core assets  such as our sale of four gross producing wells one net during the third quarter of however  if we need additional liquidity for future activities  we may be required to consider several options for raising additional funds  such as selling securities  selling assets or farm outs or similar arrangements but we may be unable to complete any of these transactions on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any financing obtained through the sale of our equity will likely result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
reduced commodity prices could impact the borrowing base under our credit agreement our credit agreement limits our borrowings to the borrowing base less our total outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder 
currently  our borrowing base is million and our outstanding letter of credit sublimit is million 
under the terms of our credit agreement  our borrowing base is subject to semi annual redetermination by our lenders based on their valuation of our proved reserves and their internal criteria 
in addition to such semi annual determinations  our lenders may request one additional borrowing base redetermination between each semi annual calculation 
our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for april  and based on the decline of commodity prices  we believe it will be reduced 
if our borrowing base is reduced as a result of a redetermination  we may be required to repay a portion of our outstanding borrowings and will have less access to borrowed capital going forward 
if we do not have sufficient funds on hand for repayment  we may be required to seek a wavier or amendment from our lenders  refinance our credit agreement  sell assets or additional shares of common stock or reduce our capital budget 
we may not be able obtain such financing or complete such transactions on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
failure to make the required repayment could result in a default under our credit agreement  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results or operations 

table of contents reduced cash flows from operations could result in a default under our credit agreement and convertible senior notes due our credit agreement contains covenants including those that require us to maintain a current ratio defined as current assets plus unused availability under the credit facility divided by current liabilities excluding the current portion of the credit agreement  determined at the end of each quarter  of not less than  and a ratio of senior debt to ebitdax as such term is defined in the revolving credit facility for the most recent four quarters not to be greater than for each fiscal quarter 
in addition  the credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur other indebtedness  create liens or sell our assets  pay dividends on our common stock and make certain investments 
as of december   our current and senior debt to ebitdax ratios were and  respectively  and we were in compliance with each of the covenants as of december  through march  sustained or lower oil and natural gas prices could reduce our consolidated ebitdax and thus could reduce our ability to maintain existing levels of senior debt or incur additional indebtedness 
additionally  at current commodity prices  ebitdax will be reduced for the four quarters beginning with the quarter ended march  by the expected payment of approximately million for early termination of our drilling contract in february  resulting in a corresponding reduction in the levels of senior debt that we may have outstanding going forward without violating our senior debt to ebitdax ratio 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of our credit agreement could result in a default which would  absent a waiver or amendment  require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement 
additionally  should our obligation to repay indebtedness under our credit agreement be accelerated  we would be in default under the indenture governing our convertible senior notes due  which would require repayment of the outstanding principal  interest and liquidated damages  if any  on such convertible notes 
to the extent it becomes necessary to address any anticipated covenant compliance issues  we may be required to sell a portion of our assets or issue additional securities  which would be dilutive to our shareholders 
given the condition of current credit and capital markets  any sale of assets or issuance of additional securities may not be on terms acceptable to us 
reduced commodity prices may result in ceiling test write downs and other impairments we may be required to write down the carrying value of our gas and oil properties as a result of low gas and oil prices or if there are substantial downward adjustments to the estimated proved reserves  increases in the estimates of development costs or deterioration in the exploration results 
investments in unproved properties  including capitalized interest costs  are also assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
we own a drilling rig that had a carrying value of approximately  in light of the current market conditions and the lower commodity prices  many oil and gas companies have cut back on their drilling plans for as a result  the demand for drilling rig services has also 
table of contents declined 
based upon an independent appraisal of our drilling rig  we believe that the market value of our drilling rig has decreased to approximately  as of december  and for that reason we have recorded impairment expense of  as discussed above  since we plan to drill only two net new wells during  we reclassified approximately  and  of expiring acreage primarily in utah and california  respectively into proved property 
this reclassification represents the value of the leases that will expire during before we are able to develop them further 
reduced commodity prices may impact our ability to produce economically significant or extended price declines may adversely affect the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
a reduction in production could result in a shortfall in our expected cash flows and require us to reduce our capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall 
any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to replace our production and our future rate of growth 
drilling activity during  we spudded gross wells approximately net wells and reached total depth on gross wells approximately net wells in the riverbend area 
thirteen of the wells were drilled to the upper mancos shale and one well was drilled to the upper morrison formation 
we also conducted initial completion operations on gross operated wells net wells and re entered gross operated wells net wells to complete pay zones that were behind pipe 
we have completed wells in the mancos shale interval since we began targeting the mancos in mid we currently have four mancos shale wells awaiting initial completion 
as of december   we operated gross producing wells 
we currently have an inventory of operated wells with up hole recompletion opportunities and four wells awaiting initial completion activities

table of contents production and reserve information the following table presents certain of the company s production information for each of the three years ended december  and our estimated proved reserves as of december of each year presented 
the mcfe calculations assume a conversion of mcf s for each bbl of oil 
for the years ended december  natural gas production mcf average sales price per mcf year end estimated proved gas reserves mcf oil production bbl average sales price per bbl year end estimated proved oil reserves bbl production mcfe year end estimated proved reserves mcfe our oil and gas production increased by approximately during as compared with primarily due to the completion of gross net new wells and the recompletion of gross net existing wells during the natural gas prices in the rockies continued their lower trend into the fourth quarter of and for that reason we elected to shut in or curtail a portion of our daily production during october and the first part of november 
this curtailment as well as normal production declines partially offset our increased production during during our proved reserve quantities decreased by approximately primarily due to the decrease in oil and gas prices used to estimate the reserves from per barrel and per mcf at december  to per barrel and per mcf at december  also contributing to the decrease in reserve quantities was the sale of our interest in four gross producing one net wells during august the majority of the revisions of previous estimates during were primarily the result of a decrease in proved undeveloped reserves as the prices of per barrel and per mcf that were used to estimate our reserves caused all of our proved undeveloped reserves to become uneconomic 
our oil and gas production increased by approximately during as compared with primarily due to our drilling and completion of gross net wells during the production increase was partially offset by our decision to curtail production due to low gas prices during the third and fourth quarters of during  the oil and gas reserve quantities increased by approximately primarily due to the increase in oil and gas prices used to estimate the reserves from per barrel and per mcf at december  to per barrel and per mcf at december  additionally  the completion of the merger with brek energy corporation increased proved reserves by approximately bcfe 
at december   our oil and gas reserves were natural gas of which are developed 

table of contents the majority of the revisions of previous estimates during were primarily the result of an increase in proved undeveloped reserves due to the increase in oil and gas prices used to estimate the reserves from per barrel and per mcf in to per barrel and per mcf at december  liquidity and capital resources please see recent developments impact of credit market and commodity prices above for a discussion of our liquidity and the impact of current market conditions thereon 
capital budget our board of directors has approved a revised initial capital budget of  we have reduced our budget by  from our preliminary budget presented in november the change in plans is a direct result of the further weakening in commodity prices  high service costs for drilling and completing wells and limited capital markets 
the revised program includes completing of one well  the drilling and completion of approximately two gross net wells and recompletions net of up hole zones on our riverbend project located in the uinta basin of utah 
the wells in the program will be drilled to develop the natural gas bearing upper mancos shale intervals and associated up hole pay zones in each wellbore 
the budget does not include possible acquisitions  but may include installation of pipeline infrastructure  distribution facilities and certain geophysical operations 
based on current expectations  we intend to fund our budget entirely through cash flow from operations 
consequently  we will monitor spending and cash flow throughout the year and may accelerate or delay investment depending on commodity prices and cash flow expectations 
at year end we were operating a single drilling rig 
this rig was released in late february  which will significantly reduce our fixed commitments in and in subsequent periods 
at rig release  we were obligated to pay the rig contractor approximately million for early termination of the drilling contract as calculated at  day from rig release through march   the expiration date of the contract 
sources and uses of funds the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for each of the three years ended december   and for the years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash flow 
table of contents the increase in cash provided by operating activities from to is primarily due to the increase in oil and gas revenue resulting from a increase in production as well as an increase in oil and gas prices of per bbl and per mcf during cash provided by operations during and remained fairly consistent primarily due to a production increase offset by a decline in gas prices from to the production increases in and were due to drilling activity 
our investing activities during the three years ended december  related primarily to our development and exploration activities 
in we had sales proceeds of  which represented the sale of a non operated interest in four producing wells and in we had sales proceeds of  which represented the sale of a partial interest in two of our producing wells 
we had no property sales during we sold  and  of our short term investments during and  respectively 
the remaining investing activity during and consisted primarily of changes in our restricted investments 
during and  our financing activity consisted primarily of borrowings and repayments under our credit agreement 
the activity in included  in proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase common stock 
the activity included a public offering of  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately  our financing activities during were comprised mainly of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options partially offset by cash paid for offering costs and preferred dividends

credit agreement on march   gasco and certain of its subsidiaries  as guarantors  entered the credit agreement 
borrowings made under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our subsidiaries  and are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of such subsidiaries and mortgages on substantially all of our oil and gas properties 
the initial aggregate commitment of the lender under the credit agreement is  subject to a borrowing base which was increased from  as of december  to  during april the credit agreement also provides for a  sublimit for letters of credit which we may use for general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement was amended in december the  borrowing base was maintained and the original maturity date was extended one year to march  the credit agreement provides for semi annual evaluation of the borrowing base  which will be determined as a percentage of the discounted present value of the company s oil and natural gas reserves  and is subject to redetermination in april additionally  the lenders thereunder may request an additional borrowing base redetermination between each semi annual calculation 
as of december   there were loans of  outstanding at an average interest rate of and letters of credit in the amount of  which are considered usage for purposes of calculating availability and commitment fees 
as of march   there were loans of  outstanding and letters of credit in the amount of  our aggregate borrowings and outstanding letters of credit under the credit agreement may not at any time exceed the borrowing base 
in connection with the december amendment  the interest rate pricing grid was increased to the levels detailed below and the commitment fee was changed to from a variable grid between and 
additionally  guarantee bank and trust company was added as a lender to the credit agreement and is currently committed for million of the million borrowing base 
the other commercial terms were substantially unchanged by the amendment 
interest on borrowings is payable monthly and principal is due at maturity on march  interest on borrowings under the credit agreement accrues at variable interest rates at either  at our election  a eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate 
the eurodollar rate is calculated as libor plus an applicable margin that varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized greater than of the borrowing base 
the alternate base rate is calculated as the greater of a the prime rate  b the federal funds effective rate plus or c the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period on such day plus  plus an applicable margin that varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized greater than of the borrowing base 
we elect the basis of the interest rate at the time of each borrowing  however  under certain 
table of contents circumstances  our lender may require us to use the non elected basis in the event the elected basis does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost of making such loans 
in addition  we are obligated to pay a commitment fee under the credit agreement quarterly in arrears based on of unused commitments 
the credit agreement requires us to comply with financial covenants that require us to maintain a current ratio defined as current assets plus unused availability under the credit agreement divided by current liabilities excluding the current portion of the credit agreement  determined at the end of each quarter  of not less than  and a ratio of senior debt to ebitdax as such terms are defined in the credit agreement for the most recent four quarters not to be greater than for each fiscal quarter 
in addition  the credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur other indebtedness  create liens or sell our assets  pay dividends on our common stock and make certain investments 
as of december   our current and senior debt to ebitdax ratios were and  respectively  and we were in compliance with each of the covenants as of december  and march  any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of the credit agreement could result in a default which  absent a waiver or amendment  would require immediate repayment of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement additionally  should our obligation to repay indebtedness under our credit agreement be accelerated  we would be in default under the indenture governing our convertible senior notes due  which would require repayment of the outstanding principal  interest and liquidated damages  if any  on such convertible notes 
sustained or lower oil and natural gas prices could reduce our consolidated ebitdax and thus could reduce our ability to maintain existing levels of senior debt or incur additional indebtedness 
ebitdax will be reduced for the four quarters beginning with the quarter ended march  by the payment of approximately million for early termination of our drilling contract in february  resulting in a corresponding reduction in the levels of senior debt that we may have outstanding going forward without violating our senior debt to ebitdax ratio 
to the extent it becomes necessary to address any anticipated covenant compliance issues  we will seek to obtain a waiver or amendment of the credit agreement from the lenders thereunder  and in the event that such waiver or amendment is not granted  we may be required to sell a portion of our assets or issue additional securities  which would be dilutive to our shareholders 
given the condition of current credit and capital markets  any sale of assets or issuance of additional securities may not be on terms acceptable to us 
any waiver or amendment may result in an increase in the interest rate pricing grid under the credit agreement 
please see item a risk factors our revolving bank credit facility imposes restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
convertible notes on october  the issue date  we closed the private placement of  in aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes due the convertible notes pursuant to an indenture dated as of october  the indenture  between us and wells fargo bank  national association  as trustee 
the amount sold consisted of  principal amount originally offered plus the exercise by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase an additional  principal amount 
the convertible notes were sold only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on rule a under the securities act of 
table of contents the convertible notes are convertible into our common stock  
par value per share  at any time prior to maturity at a conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes equivalent to a conversion price of per share  which is subject to certain anti dilution adjustments 
interest on the convertible notes accrues from the most recent interest payment date  and is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on april th and october th of each year  and commenced on april  interest is payable to holders of record on march th and september th immediately preceding the related interest payment dates  and will be computed on the basis of a day year consisting of twelve day months 
we may  at our option  at any time on or after october   in whole  and from time to time in part  redeem the convertible notes on not less than nor more than days prior notice mailed to the holders of the convertible notes  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of convertible notes to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the redemption date  if the closing price of the common stock has exceeded of the conversion price for at least trading days in any consecutive trading day period 
upon a change of control as defined in the indenture  each holder of convertible notes can require us to repurchase all of that holder s notes days after we give notice of the change of control  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to  but not including  the repurchase date  plus a make whole premium under certain circumstances described in the indenture 
the convertible notes are unsecured except as described above and unsubordinated obligations and rank on a parity except as described above in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the convertible notes effectively rank junior to any future secured indebtedness and junior to our subsidiaries liabilities 
the indenture does not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends  the repurchase of our securities or the incurrence of indebtedness 
upon a continuing event of default  the trustee or the holders of principal amount of a series of convertible notes may declare the convertible notes immediately due and payable  except that a default resulting from our entry into a bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization will automatically cause all convertible notes under the indenture to become due and payable 
the fair value of the convertible notes is  as of december   based on market quotes 
forward sales contract for our and production  we entered into a firm sales and transportation agreement to sell  mmbtu per day of our gross production from the uinta basin 
during the first quarter of   mmbtu per day of such amount was contracted at the cig first of 
table of contents month price and the remaining  mmbtu per day was priced at the nw rockies first of month price 
beginning in the second quarter of  the entire contracted amount was based on nw rockies first of month price 
we have elected the normal purchase and sale exemption under paragraph b of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  because we anticipate that we will produce the volumes required to be delivered under the terms of the contract  it is probable the delivery will be made to the counterparty and the counterparty will fulfill its contractual obligations under the terms of the contracts 
as such  we believe we are not required to treat the contract as a derivative and the contract will not be marked to market under the provisions of sfas no 
derivatives our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of two swap agreements and one costless collar agreement for production 
the fair market value of the agreements was a current asset of  as of december  these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our economically hedged production 
see further discussion in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk stock offering on april   gasco issued  shares of common stock in a public offering for gross proceeds of  the offering costs associated with this transaction were  gasco used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes 
drilling program during  we entered into a well drilling program  of which wells have been drilled  in our riverbend project through the second quarter of  as discussed previously 
the terms of the agreement allowed for nfr to earn two thirds of our interest in each acre drilling location  feet below total depth drilled  in exchange for paying its share of costs  including a per well location fee paid to gasco as the operator of the project 
during  nfr participated in the drilling of an additional four wells beyond the initial well program 
all four wells were drilled as of december  three of the four wells have been completed and are flowing to sales and one remains to be completed 
acquisition on december   we closed the previously announced purchase of brek energy corporation brek 
as a result of this acquisition the brek acquisition  gasco acquired approximately  net acres in the uinta basin of utah  approximately  net acres in the green river basin of wyoming and additional working interests in ten producing properties in which gasco was already the operator and holds working interests 
the acquisition simplified 
table of contents gasco s acreage portfolio by absorbing a working interest partner that previously owned approximately of gasco s undeveloped acreage in utah and wyoming 
gasco has not incurred any additional overhead expenses as a result of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  gasco issued  shares of its common stock to brek s shareholders 
the shares of common stock issued to brek shareholders were valued at per share  which was the average value of the company s common stock for two days before and after the merger agreement was signed 
the total purchase price of the brek acquisition was  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect the company s financial disclosures 
oil and gas properties and reserves we follow the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves less the future cash outflows associated with the asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment would be recognized 
estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows have the most significant impact on us because these reserve estimates are used in providing a measure of the overall value of our company 
estimated quantities are affected by changes in commodity prices and actual well performance 
these estimates are also used in the quarterly calculations of depletion  depreciation and impairment of our proved properties 
if our reserve quantities change or if additional costs are reclassified from unproved properties into proved properties  depletion expense could be significantly affected 
estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the securities and exchange commission sec  such as gas and oil prices  
table of contents drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the most accurate method of determining proved reserve estimates is based upon a decline analysis method  which consists of extrapolating future reservoir pressure and production from historical pressure decline and production data 
the accuracy of the decline analysis method generally increases with the length of the production history 
since most of our wells have been producing less than seven years  their production history is relatively short  so other generally less accurate methods such as volumetric analysis and analogy to the production history of wells of other operators in the same reservoir were used in conjunction with the decline analysis method to determine the estimates of our proved reserves including developed producing  developed non producing and undeveloped 
as our wells are produced over time and more data is available  the estimated proved reserves will be redetermined on an annual basis and may be adjusted based on that data 
actual future production  gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
for example a decrease in price of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel of oil would result in a decrease in our december  present value of future net cash flows of approximately  in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  acquisitions  divestitures  ownership interest revisions  results of exploration and development and prevailing gas and oil prices 
our reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
impairment of long lived assets the cost of our unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the properties 
these properties are reviewed periodically for possible impairment 
our management reviews all unproved property each quarter 
if a determination is made that acreage will be expiring or that we do not plan to develop some of the acreage that is no longer considered to be prospective  we record an impairment of the acreage and reclassify the costs to the full cost pool 
we estimate the value of these acres for the purpose of recording the related impairment 
the impairments that we have recorded were estimated by calculating a per acre value from the total unproved costs incurred for the applicable acreage divided by the total net acres owned by gasco 
this per acre estimate is then applied to the acres that we do not plan to develop in order to calculate the impairment 
a change in the estimated value of the acreage could have a material impact on the total impairment recorded by gasco  calculation of depletion expense and the ceiling test analysis 
during  we reclassified approximately  and  of expiring acreage primarily in utah and california  respectively into proved property as we do not plan to drill any new wells during this reclassification represents the value of the leases that will expire during before we are able to develop them further 
management believes that the current fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the remaining unproved property 

table of contents we currently own a drilling rig that has a carrying value of approximately  in light of the current market conditions and the lower commodity prices  many oil and gas companies have cut back on their drilling plans for as a result  the demand for drilling rig services has also declined 
based upon an independent appraisal of our drilling rig  we believe that the market value of our drilling rig has decreased to approximately  as of december  and for that reason we have recorded impairment expense of  stock based compensation we account for stock option grants and restricted stock awards in accordance with sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation 
which requires companies to recognize compensation cost for stock based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award 
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value of option awards under sfas r 
this model requires us to estimate a risk free interest rate and the volatility of our common stock price 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
derivatives during and  we entered into certain derivative instruments to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
we account for our derivatives and hedging activities under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 we are required to record our derivative instruments at their fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges  if any  are recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment are recognized in earnings 
management has decided not to use cash flow hedge accounting for our derivatives 
therefore  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the changes in fair market value are recognized in earnings 
we recorded an unrealized gain on derivative instruments of  during the year ended december  as of december   we had a net derivative asset of  of which  was measured based upon our valuation model and  as such  is classified as a level fair value measurement 
we value these level contracts using a model that considers various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c volatility factors d notional quantities e current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments and f the counterparty s and the company s credit ratings 
the unobservable inputs related to the volatility of the oil and gas commodity market are very significant in these calculations

for the years ended december  natural gas production mcf average sales price per mcf natural gas revenue oil production bbl average sales price per bbl oil revenue production mcfe total oil and gas revenue the increase in oil and gas revenue of  in compared to is comprised of a increase in oil and gas production primarily due to the drilling and completion activity during and an increase in the average gas price of per mcf and an increase of per bbl in the average oil price during the production increase during was partially offset by our decision to curtail production on some of our existing wells during the fourth quarter due to the low natural gas prices as discussed previously as well as normal production declines on wells drilled during earlier periods 
the  increase in oil and gas revenue during represents an increase of  related to the increase in oil and gas prices and an increase of  related to increased oil and gas production 
gathering revenue and expenses gathering revenue and expense represents the income earned from the third party working interest owners in the wells we operate our share of gathering revenue is eliminated against the transportation expense included in our lease operating costs and the expenses incurred from the riverbend area pipeline that we constructed during and the gathering income increased by  in as compared to due to the increased production resulting from our drilling activity in the riverbend area 
the increase in gathering expense of  during is primarily due to the addition of compression in early  as well as increased operating expenses due to the production increase described above 

table of contents rental income rental income is comprised of the lease payments received from a third party s use of the company s drilling rig 
rental income is eliminated against the full cost pool when the rig is used to drill company operated wells and rental income is recognized when the rig is used to drill third party wells 
the rig has been used for drilling third party wells only since april lease operating expenses the table below sets forth the detail of oil and gas lease operating expenses during the periods presented

additionally  the number of producing wells increased from gross wells in to gross wells in depletion  depreciation and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization expense is comprised of depletion expense related to our oil and gas properties  depreciation expense of gathering assets  facilities and equipment  furniture  fixtures and equipment and accretion expense related to the asset retirement obligation 
the decrease in depletion  depreciation and amortization expense of  during is primarily due to the  reduction in the full cost pool due to the impairments recorded during the second quarter and third quarter of  as described below  which resulted in a lower depletion base partially affected by the impairment of unproved properties and the lower quantities of reserves during however  the decline in depletion  depreciation  and amortization resulting from the impairment is partially offset by the increase in oil and gas production and related capital costs resulting from our increased drilling and completion activity discussed above 

table of contents impairment impairment expense during represents the reduction in the fair value of our drilling rig 
in light of the current market conditions and the lower commodity prices  many oil and gas companies have cut back on their drilling plans for as a result  the demand for drilling rig services has also declined 
based upon an independent appraisal of our drilling rig  we believe that the market value of our drilling rig has decreased from its carrying value of  to approximately  as of december  therefore we have recorded impairment expense of  to reduce the carrying value of the rig 
impairment expense of  during represents the impairment recorded as of june  and september  because the present value of our future net revenue discounted at exceeded our full cost pool based on current oil and gas prices 
as of june  prices were per barrel and per mcf 
therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended june  as of september   oil and gas prices were per mcf and per barrel 
our oil and gas reserves became uneconomic as the gas price on september  was less than our gathering costs to transport the gas to a sales point and would have resulted in an impairment of  however  subsequent to quarter end  oil and gas prices increased  and using these prices our full cost pool would have exceeded the above described ceiling by  therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended september  general and administrative expense the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense and stock based compensation expense incurred during the periods presented

for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarified the application of sfas no 
as it relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is not active for those financial assets 
on january   we adopted without material impact on our consolidated financial statements the provisions of sfas no 
related to financial assets and liabilities and to nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
on january   we adopted the provisions for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not required or permitted to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis  which include  among others  those nonfinancial long lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment and asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value 
we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
related to these items to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 
on february   the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired  and establishes that acquisition costs will be generally expensed as incurred 
this statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no

in april  the fasb issued fsp fin  amendment of fasb interpretation no 
fsp fin 
fsp fin defines right of setoff and specifies what conditions must be met for a derivative contract to qualify for this right of setoff 
it also addresses the applicability of a right of setoff to derivative instruments and clarifies the circumstances in which it is appropriate to offset amounts recognized for those instruments in the statement of financial position 
in addition  this fsp permits offsetting of fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral a receivable or the obligation to return cash collateral a payable arising from the same master netting arrangement as the derivative instruments 
we adopted this interpretation on january  and the adoption of fsp fin had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities which amends sfas no 
by requiring expanded disclosures about an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities  but does not change sfas no 
s scope or accounting 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas no 
on our future financial reporting 
in june  the emerging issues task force task force issued eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
the objective of this issue is to provide guidance for determining whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
the task force reached a consensus that contingent and other adjustment features in equity linked financial instruments are consistent with equity indexation if they are based on variables that would be inputs to a plain vanilla option or forward pricing model and they do not increase the contract s exposure to those variables 
additionally  denomination of an equity contract s strike price in a currency other than the entity s functional currency is inconsistent with equity indexation and precludes equity treatment 
we adopted eitf on january  and the adoption had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   the sec adopted a final rule that amends its oil and gas reporting requirements 
the revised rules change the way oil and gas companies report their reserves in the financial statements 
the rules are intended to reflect changes in the oil and gas industry since the original disclosures were adopted in definitions were updated to be consistent with petroleum resource management system prms 
other key revisions include a change in pricing used to prepare reserve estimates  the inclusion of non traditional resources in reserves  the allowance for use of new technologies in determining reserves  optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves and significant new disclosures 
the revised rules will be effective for our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ending december  the sec is precluding application of the new rules in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required and early adoption is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the effect the new rules will have on our financial reporting and anticipate that the following rule changes could have a significant impact on our results of operations as follows the price used in calculating reserves will change from a single day closing price measured on the last day of the company s fiscal year to a month average price  and will affect our depletion and ceiling test calculations 
several reserve definitions have changed that could revise the types of reserves that will be included in our year end reserve report 
many of our financial reporting disclosures could change as a result of the new rules 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
the company does not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk our results of operations and operating cash flows are affected by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our derivative instruments consisted of two swap agreements and one collar agreement for our production 
the fair market value of these agreements was a current asset of  as of december  the derivative instruments as of december  consisted of a swap agreement which we entered into during december for the calendar year the fair market value of the agreement was a liability of  as of december  these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
our derivative contracts are described below for our swap instruments  gasco receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
our costless collars contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  gasco receives the fixed price and pays the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
our swap agreements for are summarized in the table below fixed price floating price a agreement type term quantity counterparty payer gasco payer swap  mmbtu day mmbtu nw rockies swap  mmbtu day mmbtu nw rockies 
table of contents our costless collar agreement is summarized in the table below agreement index call price put price type term quantity price b counterparty buyer gasco buyer costless collar  mmbtu day nw rockies mmbtu mmbtu a northwest pipeline rocky mountains inside ferc first of month index price 
the swap contracts will allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective natural gas prices that we will receive for our hedged production and to benefit from operating cash flows when market prices are less than the fixed prices of the contracts 
however  we will not benefit from market prices that are higher than the fixed prices in the contracts for the hedged production 
the collar structures provide for participation in price increases and decreases to the extent of the ceiling and floors provided in our contracts 
our hedging contracts have no requirements for us to post additional collateral based upon the changes in the market value of our hedge instruments 
interest rate risk we do not currently use interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure  including under our revolving bank credit facility  to the volatility in interest rates
