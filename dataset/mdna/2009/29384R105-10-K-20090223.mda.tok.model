in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under part i  item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview entropic communications is a leading fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops and markets systems solutions to enable connected home entertainment 
our technologies significantly change the way hd video and other multimedia content such as movies  music  games and photos are brought into and delivered throughout the home 
our products include home networking chipsets based on the moca standard  high speed broadband access chipsets  integrated circuits that simplify and enhance digital broadcast satellite services and silicon tuner integrated circuits 
we use our considerable experience with service provider based deployments to create solutions that address the complex requirements associated with delivering multiple streams of hd video into and throughout the home  while seamlessly coexisting with video  voice and data services that are using the same coaxial cable infrastructure 
in december  we introduced and commenced commercial shipments of our home networking products 
in the first quarter of  we began commercially shipping our broadband access solutions 
in may  we acquired arabella software ltd  a developer of embedded software 
in june  we acquired rf magic  inc  a provider of digital broadcast satellite outdoor unit and silicon tuner solutions 
in  we acquired certain specified assets of vativ technologies  inc  or vativ  a provider of high bandwidth  advanced digital processing solutions for digital television and gigabit ethernet markets 
since inception  we have invested heavily in product development and have not yet achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our revenues have grown from million in to million in to million in  driven primarily by demand for our home networking products 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we generate revenues principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
we also generate service revenues from development contracts 
we principally sell our products directly to either odms or oems 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and reduce the price of our products over time  as market and competitive conditions change  and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our markets are generally characterized by declining average selling prices over the life of a product and  accordingly  we must reduce costs and successfully introduce new products and enhancements to maintain our gross margins 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
sales to these customers are in turn driven by service providers that purchase our customers products which incorporate our products 
substantially all of our revenues are dependent upon three major service providers  verizon through its fios deployment  echostar and directv 
in addition  we are dependent on sales outside of the united states for almost all of our revenues and expect that to continue in the future 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
this outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  sales and marketing of our products and avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facility 
a significant portion of our cost of net revenues consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for manufacturing  assembly and test services 
we expect research and development expenses in future years to continue to increase in total dollars as we develop additional products and expand our business  and to fluctuate over the course of the year based on the 
table of contents timing of our fabrication mask costs 
we also anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase as we expand our domestic and international sales and marketing organization and activities and build brand awareness 
due to the lengthy sales cycles that we face  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur research and development and sales and marketing expenses until the time  if ever  that we generate sales from the related products 
since our inception  we have funded our operations using a combination of preferred stock issuances  cash collections from customers  bank credit facilities  cash received from the exercise of stock options  and proceeds from our initial public offering 
we intend to continue spending substantial amounts in connection with the growth of our business and we may need to obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy  develop new products  respond to competition and market opportunities and acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  warranty accrual  inventory valuation  stock based compensation  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for income taxes  and estimation of fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock 
revenue recognition our revenues are generated principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
we account for revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
however  we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met  when applicable 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors  agents  or customers acting as agents under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
product revenues on sales made through these distributors are not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers 
we record reductions to revenues for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as competitive pricing programs  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and other factors known at the time 
if actual returns differ significantly from our estimates  
table of contents such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
to date  changes in estimated returns have not been material to net revenues in any related period 
we have entered into an inventory hubbing arrangement with a key customer 
pursuant to this arrangement  we deliver products to the designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer removes our products from the third party warehouse to incorporate into its own products 
we derive revenues from development contracts that involve new and unproven technologies 
revenues under these contracts are deferred until customer acceptance is obtained  and other contract specific terms have been completed in accordance with the completed contract method of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
provisions for losses related to development contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
the costs associated with development contracts are included in cost of service revenue 
we defer the cost of services provided under our development contracts 
we acquired a development agreement in connection with our acquisition of rf magic in june that provides us with royalties in exchange for an exclusive right to manufacture and sell certain products 
we have determined that we are not able to reliably estimate the royalties earned in the period the sales occur 
thus  we record revenues based on cash receipts 
we have entered into an arrangement to license our hardware and software to certain moca members for a period of three years and to provide upgrades when and if they become available 
under our licensing arrangement  the licensees rights to use our hardware and software are limited to testing the extent to which such licensees own product comply with the standard moca specification 
we defer all of the revenue upon delivery of our licensed hardware and software and recognize the resulting licensing revenue on a straight line basis over the three year term 
we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  and  accordingly  at the time of the sale  we accrue of the potential rebate as a reduction to revenue and do not apply a breakage factor 
the amount of these reductions is based upon the terms included in various rebate agreements 
we reverse the accrual for unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end or when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid 
for the years ended december   and  we reduced net revenue by   and  respectively  in connection with our rebate programs 
warranty accrual we generally provide a warranty on our products for a period of one year  however it may be longer for certain customers 
accordingly  we establish provisions for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based upon our historical activity  and  additionally  for any known product warranty issues 
warranty provisions are recorded as a cost of net revenues 
the determination of such provisions requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to replace or rework the products under warranty 
when the actual product failure rates  cost of replacements and rework costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual are made 
actual claims are charged against the warranty reserve 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
lower of cost or market adjustments reduce the carrying value of the related inventory and take into consideration reductions in sales prices  excess inventory levels and obsolete inventory 
these adjustments are calculated on a part by part basis and in general  represent excess inventory value on hand compared to month demand projections 
once established  these adjustments are considered permanent and are not reversed until the related inventory is sold or disposed 

table of contents stock based compensation we have stock incentive plans under which incentive stock options have been granted to employees and restricted stock units and non qualified stock options have been granted to employees and nonemployees 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees 
we follow the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  including the provisions of sab no 
 or sab  and sab no 
 or sab under sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we have not granted awards with vesting subject to market or performance conditions 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to awards granted after january   and to awards that are outstanding on that date which are subsequently modified or canceled 
prior to the adoption of sfas r in january  we used the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb and its related interpretations  and the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for employee stock options and recorded compensation cost for options granted at exercise prices that were less than the market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
pursuant to sfas r  as we utilized the minimum value method through december   we will continue to recognize compensation expense relating to unvested awards as of the date of adoption using apb  which is the same accounting principle originally applied to those awards 
we have estimated the fair value of stock options and restricted stock units as of the date of grant or assumption using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable 
the black scholes model considers  among other factors  the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of our stock price 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and restricted stock units under sfas r on a quarterly basis 
based on guidance provided in sfas r  sab and sab  the expected option life reflects the application of the simplified method set out in sab and sab the simplified method defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches 
the risk free interest rate is based on zero coupon us treasury instruments with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued 
the estimated volatility reflects the application of sab and sab s interpretive guidance and  accordingly  incorporates historical volatility of similar entities whose share prices are publicly available 
in  we started to include a weighting of our own historical volatility with that of similar entities 
the expected dividend yield was based on our expectation of not paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the stock based compensation for our employee stock purchase plan was determined using the black scholes option pricing model and the provisions of fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option  as amended by sfas r 
the following assumptions are used to value options and awards granted under our equity incentive plans for the years ended december   and employee stock options years ended december  expected option life in years risk free interest rate to to to expected volatility to to expected dividend yield 
table of contents we recognize excess tax benefits associated with stock based compensation to stockholders equity only when such benefits have been realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach excluding any indirect effects to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
the weighted average grant date fair value per share of employee stock options granted during the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to employees for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the total intrinsic value of outstanding options as of december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the stock options granted to non employees was estimated using the black scholes option valuation model 
stock based compensation expense related to non employees for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
we account for stock based compensation awards granted to non employees in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf under eitf  we determine the fair value of the stock based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
if the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used  it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached  or the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we use the discounted cash flow method to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired 
the estimates used to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
goodwill impairment sfas requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  using fair value measurement techniques 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
at december   before recording any goodwill impairment charges  the carrying value of our net assets was million and the market capitalization of our outstanding shares was million 
during december  we lowered the business outlook on both our revenue and cash flow projections primarily due to the delay of additional service providers not deploying our products as soon as they has previously indicated and the longer term exposure associated with worsening general economic conditions 
we also saw our market valuation significantly decrease during the fourth quarter as our share price decreased from at september  to at december  additionally  as a result of the depressed macroeconomic environment and resulting declines in equity values we saw a perceived increase in the discount rate used in computing the values of the lowered projected cash flows 

table of contents we operate as one reporting unit 
in order to perform the year end impairment analysis  we were required to estimate the fair value of the company 
the fair value of the company was calculated as though the company was sold in its entirety in an orderly transaction between market participants as of december   using two valuation methods 
first  we used the quoted market price of our individual equity security and added a control premium that is representative of recent transactions in the technology industry 
second  we performed a discounted cash flow analysis using updated forward looking projections of our estimated future operating results 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including the size and timing of deployments by our customers and related projections and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  stage of products in development  determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
for the year ended december   the income approach valuations included a discount rate of and a terminal value growth rate of 
based on the result of each method and a comparison of the quantitative assumptions between the methods  we concluded that our carrying value exceeded its fair value by million 
accordingly  we performed a step analysis in which we performed a hypothetical purchase price allocation 
based on this analysis  we concluded that the goodwill carrying value of million was fully impaired at december  impairment of long lived assets including finite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess potential impairments to our long lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of the assets carrying value unlikely 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
should impairment exist  the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value 
during december  we lowered the business outlook and both of our revenue and cash flow projections primarily due to the delay of additional service providers not deploying the our products and the longer term exposure associated with worsening general economic conditions 
we also saw our market valuation significantly decrease during the quarter as our share price decreased from at september  to at december  additionally  as a result of the depressed macroeconomic environment and resulting declines in equity values we saw a perceived increase in the discount rate used in computing the values of the lowered projected cash flows 
this resulted in a discount rate of when we calculated our discounted cash flows attributable to the intangible assets 
as a result of the above impairment indicators  we performed an impairment analysis 
fair value in the impairment analysis was calculated using the expected discounted future cash flows 
expected future cash flows are estimated over the related assets remaining estimated useful lives and consist of the estimated revenues and expenses associated with those assets 
we determined the estimated future cash flow streams from the various intangible assets were largely independent of one another and accordingly  estimated future cash flows by individual intangible asset were projected 
in connection with our impairment analysis in the quarter ended december   we determined certain intangible assets were impaired and  accordingly  recorded an impairment charge of million 
we determined our fixed assets were not impaired and therefore a charge was not recorded 
purchase price amounts assigned to acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  are expensed immediately 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded write offs of ipr d of million  million and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 

table of contents we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we also follow fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin  which provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
we estimate current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have recorded a receivable for certain refundable credits previously included in our deferred tax assets 
as of the same date  we recorded a full valuation allowance of million against our remaining deferred tax assets  based on the available evidence  we believed at that time it was more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize these deferred tax assets in the future 
we intend to maintain the full valuation allowances until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowances 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
we are in the process of expanding our international operations and staff to better support our expansion into international markets 
we anticipate that this expansion will include the implementation of an international organizational structure 
as a result of this anticipated change and an expanding international customer base  we expect that an increasing percentage of our consolidated pre tax income will be derived from  and reinvested in  our international operations 
moreover  we anticipate that this pre tax income will be subject to foreign tax at relatively lower tax rates when compared to the us federal statutory tax rate and  as a consequence  our future effective income tax rate is expected to be lower than the us federal statutory rate 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
as of the same date  we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credit carryforward will expire commencing in while the state of california research tax credits will continue in effect indefinitely 
utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the tax benefits related to future utilization of federal and state net operating losses and tax credit 
table of contents carryforwards may be limited or lost if cumulative changes in ownership exceed within any three year period 
we have completed an analysis of the impact of our acquisition of rf magic and prior changes in ownership of entropic and rf magic and have determined that such changes in ownership have resulted in limitations on the amount of the companies net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized in the future  however  we do not anticipate that such annual limitations will preclude the utilization of substantially all of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards described above in the event we become profitable 
our ability to utilize these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be further limited by changes in ownership  the implementation of an international organizational structure  the issuance of common stock in future common stock offerings or transactions  or other future events 
additional limitations on the use of these tax attributes could occur in the event of disputes arising in examinations by various taxing authorities 
currently  we are not under examination by any taxing authority 
any carryforwards that will expire prior to utilization as a result of such limitations will be removed from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fin we recorded a cumulative charge of million which was recorded as a decrease to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction to the valuation allowance 
for the year ended december   the balance in our fin liability increased to million 
for the year ended december   we have adopted filing methods and documentation procedures that have eliminated the uncertainties previously associated with our uncertain tax positions 
in this process  we also made certain corrections to our computation of prior year s fin liability which increased our fin liability for pre acquisition tax periods by million to a total fin liability at december  of million 
estimation of fair value of warrants to purchase preferred stock we applied fasb staff position  or fsp   issuer s accounting under fasb statement no 
for freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable  or fsp to our warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock 
as such  we classified these warrants as current liabilities and adjusted the value of these warrants to their fair value at the end of each reporting period 
we recorded and  of income and  of expense on change in fair value of warrants for the years ended december   and  respectively  to reflect changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants 
the fair value at each reporting period was calculated using the black scholes pricing model with current assumptions 
upon the closing of our initial public offering  the remaining outstanding warrants converted to warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and  as a result  are no longer subject to fsp at that time  the then current aggregate fair value of these warrants was reclassified from current liabilities to additional paid in capital  and we ceased to record any related periodic fair value adjustments 
acquisitions year ended december  on april   we acquired certain specified assets of vativ  including vativ s intellectual property rights  existing product lines  inventory and equipment 
we paid million in cash   of which was contributed  and remains subject  to an escrow fund which is available to satisfy potential indemnity claims until the first anniversary of the closing of the acquisition 
the results of operations of vativ have been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the acquired assets did not include vativ s cash  cash equivalents  investments or any portion of vativ s accounts receivable 
we assumed certain liabilities of vativ equal to  including current accounts payable and accrued vacation liabilities for the former employees of vativ hired by us 
in addition  we committed to pay cash retention bonuses in the aggregate amount of  to employees hired from vativ in connection with the acquisition earned over the first days of employment 
the retention bonuses were recorded as 
table of contents expense during the service period and were not included in the assumed liabilities 
in july and january  we paid  and  respectively  for these retention bonuses 
year ended december  in may  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of arabella in exchange for  shares of our common stock  cash consideration of  and legal and other costs of  for a total purchase price of million 
in june  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of rf magic in exchange for rights to receive  shares of our common stock   shares of our series d preferred stock   shares of our series d preferred stock and  shares of our series d preferred stock 
immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering  the shares of our series d  d and d preferred stock converted into   and  shares of our common stock  respectively 
except for stock options held by employees of rf magic s french subsidiary  we also assumed each outstanding option to purchase rf magic common stock and converted these options into options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
pursuant to put and call option agreements  as of december   we may issue up to  shares of our common stock in exchange for the shares of rf magic s common stock issuable upon exercise of the unassumed options 
we also assumed each outstanding warrant to purchase rf magic common stock  series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock and converted these warrants into warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock   shares of our series d preferred stock and  shares of our series d preferred stock  respectively 
upon the closing of our initial public offering  the warrants to purchase shares of our series d preferred stock and series d preferred stock converted into warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock and  shares of our common stock  respectively 
the total purchase price for the rf magic acquisition was million 
the securities we issued or reserved for issuance pursuant to the rf magic acquisition represented of the combined company s fully diluted capitalization as of the closing date for the acquisition including shares available for issuance under equity incentive plans and assuming conversion of all outstanding preferred stock and exercise of all outstanding stock options and warrants 
initial public offering in december  we completed our initial public offering of our common stock 
aggregate net proceeds from our initial public offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and issuance costs  were million 
we also had  shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding that automatically converted into  shares of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering 
during the year ended december   we used million and million of the net proceeds from the initial public offering of our common stock for the repayment of all principal and accrued interest owed under our then existing credit facilities with horizon technology funding llc and silicon valley bank  and our acquisition of the specified assets of vativ  respectively 
we currently have no specific plans for the use of the remaining net proceeds to us from the offering  nor have we performed studies or made preliminary decisions with respect to the best use of the capital resources resulting from the offering 
we anticipate using the balance of the net proceeds to us from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes 
we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to us from the offering to acquire or license products  technologies or businesses  but we currently have no agreements or commitments relating to material acquisitions or licenses 
accordingly  our management will have broad discretion in the application of our net proceeds from the offering 
currently  a portion of the proceeds are invested in short term  interest bearing investment grade instruments and treasury money market funds

we generate revenues principally by sales of our semiconductor products 
we also generate service revenues from development contracts 
we principally sell our products directly to either odms or oems 
we price our products based on market and competitive conditions and periodically reduce the price of our products  as market and competitive conditions change  and as manufacturing costs are reduced 
our markets are generally characterized by declining average selling prices over the life of a product and accordingly we must reduce costs and successfully introduce new products and enhancements to maintain our gross margins 
we currently rely  and expect to continue to rely  on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues 
for the years ended december  and  four customers accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
for the year ended december   three customers accounted for of our revenues 
we expect our revenue concentration to decrease further if additional customers and service providers adopt our solutions 
in addition  we depend on a limited number of service providers that purchase products from our customers that incorporate our products 
to date  only one major service provider  verizon  has publicly announced its intention to use the moca standard for home networking in its fios deployment 
we also primarily rely on two major service providers  echostar and directv  to deploy products using our dbs outdoor unit solutions 
during the year ended december   products sold to our customers that were incorporated into products purchased by verizon  echostar and directv accounted for substantially all of our revenues 
the fios deployment by verizon has been a primary driver of our revenues and we expect this to continue in the near future 

table of contents since inception  we have derived our revenues primarily from asia  the united states and other north american countries 
revenues are allocated to the geographic region based on the shipping destination of customers orders 
for sales to odms and oems  their geographic locations may differ from those of the ultimate end customers 
of our million in revenues in  million  million and million were derived from asia  europe  the united states and other north american countries  respectively 
of our million in revenues in  million  million and million were derived from asia  europe  the united states and other north american countries  respectively 
of our million in revenues in  million   and  were derived from asia  the united states and other north american countries  respectively 
accordingly  we are dependent on sales outside of the united states for almost all of our revenues and expect that to continue in the future 
cost of net revenues 
we use third party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
a significant portion of our cost of net revenues consists of payments for the purchase of wafers and for manufacturing  assembly and test services

recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
we adopted this pronouncement as of january  for financial instruments and other certain assets 
although the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our interim financial results  we are now required to provide additional disclosures as part of our financial statements 
on february   fasb issued a final fsp on sfas b  effective date of fasb statement no 
this fsp delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities has been delayed by one year to years beginning after november   and we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this statement on our financial statements 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect sfas r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions consummated after the effective date 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  or sfas sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales have been historically denominated in us dollars and an increase in the value of us dollar relative to the currencies of the countries in which our customers operate could materially affect the demand of our non us customers for our products  leading to a reduction in orders placed by these customers  which would adversely affect our business 
our international sales and marketing operations incur expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies 
these expenses could be materially affected by currency fluctuations  however  we do not consider this currency risk to be material as the related costs do not constitute a significant portion of our total spending 
we outsource our wafer manufacturing  assembly  testing  warehousing and shipping operations  however all expenses related thereto are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to the currencies of the countries in which such contractors operate  the prices we are charged for their services may increase  which would adversely affect our business 
currently  we have not implemented any hedging strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in deposits and money market funds with major financial institutions  us government obligations and debt securities of corporations with strong credit ratings in a variety of industries that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
these guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
a change in market interest rates of annualized would have impacted our net income from these investments by million for the year ended december  marketable securities risk our marketable securities  consisting of us treasury and agency obligations  commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  time deposits  foreign notes and certificates of deposits  are generally classified as held to maturity and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
in the past  certain of our short term marketable securities were classified as available for sale and were stated at fair value  which was equal to cost due to the short term maturity of these securities 
in the event that there were to be a difference between fair value and cost in any of our available for sale securities  unrealized gains and losses on these investments would be reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our investment policy for marketable securities requires that all securities mature in two years or less  with a weighted average maturity of no longer than months 
as of december   the carrying value of million approximated the fair value of these securities 
the fair value of our marketable securities fluctuates based on changes in market conditions and interest rates and is affected by the credit condition of the us 
table of contents financial sector 
absent the unprecedented turmoil and upheaval in the us financial sector  given the short term maturities of our marketable securities  we do not believe these instruments to be subject to significant market or interest rate risk 
however  the current unstable credit environment of the us financial sector may lead us to incur significant realized  unrealized or impairment losses associated with our investments 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to rising interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
the carrying value  maturity and estimated fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and  respectively  were as follows carrying value december  maturity fair value december  in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average yield marketable securities weighted average yield carrying value december  maturity fair value december  in thousands  except interest rates investments cash equivalents weighted average yield marketable securities weighted average yield
