we currently do not have a bank line of credit or other credit facility in place 
because we have no debt  we are not subject to contractual restrictions or other influences on our operations  such as payment demands and restrictions on the use of operating funds that are typically associated with debt 
if we borrow money in the future  we will likely be subject to operating and financial covenants that could limit our ability to operate as profitably as we have in the past 
defaults under applicable loan agreements could result in the demand by lenders for immediate payment of substantial funds and substantial restrictions on expenditures  among other things 
due to the current economic recession and disruption in the capital and credit markets  additional capital  if needed  may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all

critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make some estimates and judgments that affect the preparation of these financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  but actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  and the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
sab no 
and sop require that four basic criteria must be met before revenues can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect and do not bear interest 
the collectibility of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific reserve for bad debt is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered 
stock based compensation 
the company previously accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
the company grants stock options with exercise prices equal to the respective grant date s fair market value and  as such  recognized no compensation cost for such stock options under apb no 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r for our stock based awards 
see note of the financial statements for further discussion of the impact on the company s earnings 
backlog backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under existing contracts

as of december   we had a twelve month backlog of approximately million in connection with non recurring system purchases and approximately million in connection with recurring payments under support  business management  asp and isp contracts 

table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market and interest rate risk our exposure to market risk relates primarily to the potential change in the value of our investment portfolio as a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
the primary purpose of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk of loss 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted of a variety of financial instruments  including  but not limited to  money market securities  commercial paper and high quality government and corporate obligations 
it is our intent to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the securities in our investment portfolio are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our balance sheet as a current asset at fair market value with their unrealized gain or loss reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
due to the conservative allocation of our investment portfolio  we do not believe that an immediate increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially effected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks
