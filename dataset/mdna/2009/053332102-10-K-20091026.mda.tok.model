item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are the nation s leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories 
we began operations in and at august   operated  stores in the united states and puerto rico  and in mexico 
each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars  sport utility vehicles  vans and light trucks  including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and non automotive products 
at august   in  of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local  regional and national repair garages  dealers  service stations and public sector accounts 
we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www 
alldata 
com 
additionally  we sell automotive hard parts  maintenance items  accessories and non automotive products through www 
autozone 
com  and as part of our commercial sales program  through www 
autozonepro 
com 
we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services 
executive summary we achieved a solid performance in fiscal  delivering record earnings of million and sales growth of million over the prior year  excluding the rd week in last year s results 
we completed the year with strong growth in our commercial and retail businesses 
we are excited about our retail business opportunities and encouraged by the increase in our commercial business  where we continued to build our internal sales force and to refine our parts assortment 
there are various factors occuring within the current economy that affect both our customers and our industry  including the credit crisis and higher unemployment  which we believe when combined have aided our sales growth during the year 
we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macro economic environment 
the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 
miles driven declined for the sixteenth straight month in march  were relatively flat in april and may before increasing in june and july 
we are optimistic that over the long term this trend will stabilize at low single digit increases as the number of vehicles on the road continues to increase 
new vehicle sales declined significantly during and the first half of  which we believe is contributing to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road 
in the near term  we expect this trend to continue  as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy 
also  we believe gas prices impact our customers behavior with respect to driving and maintaining their cars 
with approximately ten billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the united states  each dollar decrease at the pump contributes approximately billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month 
during the summer of  gas prices peaked at roughly per gallon  before falling to per gallon in february by the end of fiscal  gas prices had risen to approximately per gallon 
during fiscal  we worked hard to execute on several key initiatives as the macro environment turned in our industry s favor and we saw an increase in traffic in our stores 
we significantly enhanced the utilization of our hub stores by refining and improving the product assortment in these locations while simultaneously increasing the delivery frequency to nearby stores 
we accelerated our store maintenance efforts and also deployed additional capital in areas that we expect to yield benefits in the future  such as enhancing our it infrastructure and continued additions of late model products 
we also began an effort to purchase more of our new store locations rather than leasing them 
finally  we maintained our focus on developing a first class commercial field sales organization by continuing to expand the size of our team and investing in training  tools and management programs 
in this challenging environment  we continue to see sales of maintenance and failure categories perform well  while discretionary categories are being negatively impacted 
consequently  we remain focused on refining and expanding our product assortment to ensure we have the best merchandise at the right price in each of our merchandise categories 

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal for the year ended august   autozone reported net sales of billion compared with billion for the year ended august   a increase from fiscal excluding million of sales from the rd week included in the prior year  total company net sales increased 
this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of and sales from new stores of million 
the improvement in same store sales was driven by an improvement in transaction count trends  while increases in average transaction value remained generally consistent with our long term trends 
higher transaction value is attributable to product inflation due to both more complex  costly products and commodity price increases 
at august   we operated  domestic stores and stores in mexico  compared with  domestic stores and stores in mexico at august  excluding the sales from the rd week in the prior year  domestic retail sales increased and domestic commercial sales increased 
gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales for fiscal gross profit as a percent of net sales was positively impacted by favorable distribution costs from improved efficiencies and lower fuel costs 
however  this favorability was largely offset by a shift in mix to lower margin products 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to billion  or of net sales  from billion  or of net sales for fiscal leverage from increased sales was largely offset by expenses associated with our continued enhancements to our hub stores  an acceleration of our store maintenance program  and a continued expansion of our commercial sales force 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal this increase was due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period and a higher percentage of fixed rate debt 
average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal and weighted average borrowing rates were for fiscal  compared to for fiscal our effective income tax rate was of pre tax income for fiscal compared to for fiscal refer to note d income taxes for additional information regarding our income tax rate 
net income for fiscal increased by to million  and diluted earnings per share increased to from in fiscal the impact of the fiscal stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal was an increase of approximately 
excluding the additional week in the prior year  net income for the year increased over the previous year  while diluted earnings per share increased 
fiscal compared with fiscal for the year ended august   autozone reported net sales of billion compared with billion for the year ended august   a increase from fiscal this growth was primarily driven by net sales of million for fiscal from new stores  million  or a increase  from the addition of the rd week and a domestic same store sales excluding rd week increase of 
at august   we operated  domestic stores and in mexico  compared with  domestic stores and in mexico at august  the domestic same store sales increase was driven by higher average transaction value  partially offset by lower transaction count 
higher transaction value was primarily attributable to product price inflation due both to more complex  costly products and to commodity price increases 
transaction counts were lower due to a combination of factors  including product life cycles and deferred maintenance 
including the rd week  domestic retail sales increased and domestic commercial sales increased from prior year 
alldata and mexico sales  including the rd week  increased over prior year  contributing percentage points of the total increase in net sales 
gross profit for fiscal was billion  or of net sales  compared with billion  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percent of net sales was primarily due to an approximately basis point benefit from category management efforts  including increases in average retail prices of products sold and vendor supported promotional activities 
these efforts were partially offset by increased distribution expense principally relating to higher fuel costs 

table of contents operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased to billion  or of net sales  from billion  or of net sales for fiscal approximately basis points of the increase in operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  was due to higher employee medical expense driven by an increase in the number of catastrophic claims 
the remaining increase was primarily due to higher fuel expense for our commercial fleet from increased fuel prices approximately basis points of the increase 
interest expense  net for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower short term rates and was offset by higher average borrowing levels over the comparable fiscal period and the impact of the additional week in fiscal average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal weighted average borrowing rates were at august   compared to at august  our effective income tax rate was of pre tax income for fiscal compared to for fiscal net income for fiscal increased by to million  and diluted earnings per share increased to from in fiscal the impact of the fiscal stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal was an increase of approximately 
excluding the additional week  net income for the year increased over the previous year to million  while diluted earnings per share increased to per share 
seasonality and quarterly periods autozone s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of march through september  in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about to higher than in the slower months of december through february 
during short periods of time  a store s sales can be affected by weather conditions 
extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products 
mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales  as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather  with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather 
over the longer term  the effects of weather balance out  as we have stores throughout the united states  puerto rico and mexico 
each of the first three quarters of autozone s fiscal year consisted of weeks  and the fourth quarter consisted of weeks in  weeks in  and weeks in because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of or weeks  compared with weeks for each of the first three quarters  our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income 
the fourth quarter of fiscal year  containing weeks  represented of annual sales and of net income  the fourth quarter of fiscal  containing weeks  represented of annual sales and of net income  and the fourth quarter of fiscal  containing weeks  represented of annual sales and of net income 
liquidity and capital resources the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and accessories 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase over prior year was primarily due to the growth in net income and to a lesser extent  timing of income tax payments and deductions  and improvements in our accounts payable to inventory ratio as our vendors continue to finance a large portion of our inventory 
partially offsetting this increase were higher accounts receivable and the rd week of income in last year s sales 
the increase in fiscal verses fiscal was due primarily to higher net income and an increase in our accounts payable to inventory ratio 
we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of at august   at august   and at august  our inventory increases are primarily attributable to an increased number of stores and to a lesser extent  our efforts to update product assortment in all of our stores 
additionally  many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortment by providing extended payment terms 
these extended payment terms have allowed us to grow accounts payable at a faster rate than inventory 

table of contents autozone s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program 
from the beginning of fiscal to august   we have opened new stores 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we invested million in capital assets in fiscal  compared to million in capital assets in fiscal  and million in capital assets in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal was primarily attributable to the types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores 
new store openings were for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal we invest a portion of our assets held by the company s wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities 
we acquired million of marketable securities in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we had proceeds from matured marketable securities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal capital asset disposals provided million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled billion for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the treasury stock purchases in fiscal  and were primarily funded by cash flow from operations  and at times  by increases in debt levels 
proceeds from issuance of debt were million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and none for fiscal debt repayments totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal as discussed in note h financing  in july  we issued million in senior notes due the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used to repay outstanding commercial paper indebtedness  to prepay our million term loan in august and for general corporate purposes  including for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  new store openings and stock repurchases 
net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper were million for fiscal and million for fiscal for fiscal  net repayments of commercial paper were million 
we expect to invest in our business consistent with historical rates during fiscal  primarily related to our new store development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure 
in addition to the building and land costs  our new store development program requires working capital  predominantly for inventories 
historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers  reducing the working capital required 
we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases  however  our ability to do so may be impacted by a prolonged tightening of the credit markets which may directly limit our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us 
depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions  we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures  working capital requirements and stock repurchases 
the balance may be funded through new borrowings 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 
credit ratings at august   autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard poor s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a moody s investors service had assigned the company a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa and a commercial paper rating of p fitch ratings assigned the company a bbb rating for senior unsecured debt and an f rating for commercial paper 
as of august   moody s  standard poor s and fitch had autozone listed as having a stable outlook 
if our credit ratings drop  our interest expense will increase  similarly  we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised 
if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels  we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will likely increase  as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade  our access to financing may become more limited 

table of contents debt facilities in july   we terminated our billion revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to expire in fiscal  and replaced it with an million revolving credit facility 
this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings  letters of credit and other short term unsecured bank loans 
the credit facility may be increased to billion at autozone s election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval  may include up to million in letters of credit  and may include up to million in capital leases each fiscal year 
as the available balance is reduced by commercial paper borrowings and certain outstanding letters of credit  the company had million in available capacity under this facility at august  interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate plus the applicable percentage  which could range from basis points to basis points  depending upon our senior unsecured non credit enhanced long term debt rating 
this facility expires in july during august  we elected to prepay  without penalty  our million bank term loan entered in december  and subsequently amended 
the term loan facility provided for a term loan  which consisted of  at our election  base rate loans  eurodollar loans or a combination thereof 
the entire unpaid principal amount of the term loan was due and payable in full on december   when the facility was scheduled to terminate 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december   to effectively fix  based on current debt ratings  the interest rate of the term loan at 
the outstanding liability associated with the interest rate swap totaled million  and was expensed in operating  selling  general and administrative expenses upon termination of the hedge in fiscal on june   we entered into an agreement with esl investments  inc the esl agreement  setting forth certain understandings and agreements regarding the voting by esl investments  inc  on behalf of itself and its affiliates collectively  esl  of certain shares of common stock of autozone  inc and related matters 
among other things  we agreed to use our commercially reasonable efforts to increase our adjusted debt ebitdar target ratio from to no later than february  we met this commitment at february  we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt  capital lease obligations and annual rent times six  and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  rent and stock option expenses to net income 
at august   our adjusted debt ebitdar ratio was the esl agreement is filed as exhibit to this form k 
on august   we issued million in senior notes due and million in senior notes due under our shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  the shelf registration 
that shelf registration allowed us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes  including repaying  redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  stock repurchases and acquisitions 
on july   we issued million in senior notes due under the shelf registration 
we used the proceeds to pay down our commercial paper borrowings  to prepay in full our million term loan in august  and the remainder for general corporate purposes  including for working capital requirements  capital expenditures  new store openings and stock repurchases 
the and senior notes issued during august  and the senior notes issued in july  are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded 
they also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements 
our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants  primarily restrictions on liens 
under our other borrowing arrangements  covenants include limitations on total indebtedness  restrictions on liens  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances 
all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs 
the million revolving credit agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest  taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents 
our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august  was as of august   we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants 

table of contents stock repurchases during  we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors 
the program was last amended in june to increase the repurchase authorization to billion from billion 
from january to august   we have repurchased a total of million shares at an aggregate cost of billion 
we repurchased million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of billion during fiscal  million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal  and million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal from august  to october   we repurchased million shares for million

operating lease obligations are inclusive of amounts accrued within deferred rent and closed store obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
capital lease obligations include related interest 
the company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation  employee health  general and product liability  property  and vehicle insurance 
these amounts represent estimates based on actuarial calculations 
although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities  the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns 
accordingly  the company reflects the net present value of these obligations in its consolidated balance sheets 
we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account 
as disclosed in note k pension and savings plans  our pension liability is million and our pension assets are million at august  additionally  as disclosed in note d income taxes  our tax liability for uncertain tax positions  including interest and penalties  was million at august  approximately million is classified as short term and million is classified as long term 
we did not reflect these obligations in the financial commitments table as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of the settlement of these tax positions 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august  total other in thousands commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers 
there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
the standby letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements expire within one year  but have automatic renewal clauses 
in conjunction with our commercial sales program  we offer credit to some of our commercial customers 
historically  certain of the receivables related to this credit program were sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse 
at august   we had million outstanding under this program 
during the second quarter of fiscal  autozone terminated its agreement to sell receivables to a third party 
there were no amounts outstanding under this program as of august  value of pension assets at august   the fair market value of autozone s pension assets was million  and the related accumulated benefit obligation was million based on an august  measurement date 
on january   our defined benefit pension plans were frozen 
accordingly  plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas  and no new participants may join the plans 
the material assumptions for fiscal are an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a discount rate of

these non gaap financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders value 
non gaap financial measures should not be used as a substitute for gaap financial measures  or considered in isolation  for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance  financial position or cash flows 
however  we have presented the non gaap financial measures  as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly the company s comparative year to year operating results

table of contents critical accounting estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions 
our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following items in our consolidated financial statements require significant estimation or judgment inventory reserves and cost of sales lifo we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo method for domestic merchandise and the first in  first out fifo method for mexico inventories 
due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases  our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method 
we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments  and due to price deflation  lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by million at august   calculated using the dollar value method 
inventory obsolescence and shrinkage our inventory  primarily hard parts  maintenance items and accessories non automotive products  is used on vehicles that have rather long lives  and therefore  the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs  we record a charge less than million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference 
these charges are based on management s judgment  including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods 
historically  we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory  nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates 
however  we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns 
additionally  we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage  which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories 
shrinkage may occur due to theft  loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods  among other things 
throughout the year  we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates 
we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results 
over the last three years  there has been less than a basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate 
each quarter  we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results 
to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates  we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use 
a difference in our inventory reserves as of august   would have affected net income by approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents vendor allowances autozone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including allowances for warranties  advertising and general promotion of vendor products 
vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory  unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendor s products 
approximately of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold 
based on our vendor agreements  a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases 
therefore  we record receivables for funding not yet received as we purchase inventory 
during the year  we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations 
we have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them 
historically  we have had minimal write offs less than thousand in any of the last three years and these write offs were due to severed relationships 
self insurance we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation  vehicle  employee health  general and products liability and property losses  and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks 
our self insurance reserve estimates totaled million  million  and million as of the end of fiscal years   and  respectively 
these increases are primarily reflective of our growing operations  including inflation and increases in vehicles and the number of hours worked 
the assumptions made by management in estimating our self insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience  judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels 
we utilize various methods  including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods  to estimate the cost to settle reported claims  and claims incurred  but not yet reported 
the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating these liabilities  we consider factors  such as the severity  duration and frequency of claims  legal costs associated with claims  healthcare trends  and projected inflation of related factors 
in recent history  we have experienced improvements in frequency and duration of claims  however  medical and wage inflation have partially offset these trends 
throughout this time  our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent  and these trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates 
management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks 
arriving at these estimates  however  requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management  and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates 
for example  changes in our assumptions about health care costs  the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness  the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates  causing our reserves to be overstated or understated 
for instance  a change in our self insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately million for fiscal as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred  we will adjust our reserves accordingly 
in recent years  we have experienced favorable claims development  particularly related to workers compensation  and have adjusted our estimates accordingly 
we attribute this success to programs  such as return to work and projects aimed at accelerating claims closure 
the programs have matured and proven to be successful and are therefore considered in our current and future assumptions regarding claims costs 
our liabilities for workers compensation  certain general and product liability  property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities  however  the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities 
accordingly  we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our balance sheet using the risk free interest rate as of the balance sheet date 
if the discount rate used to calculate present value of these reserves changed by basis points  net income would have changed approximately million at august  our liability for health benefits is classified as current  as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks 

table of contents income taxes our income tax returns are audited by state  federal and foreign tax authorities  and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time 
tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits  changes in tax laws  litigation  appeals and experience with previous similar tax positions 
we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded 
as of august   we had approximately million reserved for uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings in accordance with fin by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years  however  actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
specifically  management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of certain tax positions 
additionally  to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or must pay in excess of recognized reserves  our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
pension obligation prior to january   substantially all full time employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan 
the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee s highest consecutive five year average compensation 
on january   the plan was frozen 
accordingly  pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan 
on january   the company s supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen 
accordingly  plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan 
as the plan benefits are frozen  the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels  but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances i 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets as described more fully in note k pension and savings plans  we have assumed an long term rate of return on our plan assets 
this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio  our historical long term investment performance and current market conditions 
we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis  and revise it accordingly 
additionally  we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets 
at august   our plan assets totaled million in our qualified plan 
we have no assets in our nonqualified plan 
a basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense income by approximately thousand for the qualified plan 
ii 
discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities 
this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year 
for fiscal  we assumed a discount rate of 
a decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense 
a basis point change in the discount rate at august  would impact annual pension expense income by approximately million for the qualified plan and thousand for the nonqualified plan 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk autozone is exposed to market risk from  among other things  changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
from time to time  we use various financial instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks 
to date  based upon our current level of foreign operations  no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk 
all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors 
further  we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk autozone s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates 
at times  we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts  treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps 
autozone has historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances 
we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets or liabilities 
all of the company s interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges 
we had an outstanding interest rate swap with a negative fair value of million at august   to effectively fix the interest rate on the million term loan entered into during december during the current fiscal year  we prepaid the term loan and terminated the interest rate swap  as a result  at august   we had no outstanding interest rate swaps 
unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
for further discussion  see note g derivative financial instruments 
the fair value of our debt was estimated at billion as of august   and billion as of august   based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to autozone for debt having the same remaining maturities 
such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by million at august   and less than the carrying value of debt by million at august  we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at august   and considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge  no variable rate debt outstanding at august  in fiscal  at this borrowing level for variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre tax earnings and cash flows of million  which includes the effects of the interest rate swap 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor 
we had outstanding fixed rate debt of billion at august   and considering the effect of the interest rate swap designated and effective as a cash flow hedge  billion at august  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by million at august   and million at august  fuel price risk fuel swap contracts that we utilize have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas and thus do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  although the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure 
in fiscal year  we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our unleaded fuel exposure 
we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during the fiscal year and during fiscal year  we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our unleaded and diesel fuel exposures 
as of august   we had an outstanding liability of less than one hundred thousand dollars associated with our unleaded fuel swap and no outstanding fuel swap contracts at august  the swaps during fiscal years and had no significant impact on our results of operations in either year 

table of contents foreign currency risk foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
the company and its subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material 
the company s primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican peso denominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars 
the company generally views as long term its investments in the mexican subsidiaries  which have the mexican peso as the functional currency 
as a result  the company generally does not hedge these net investments 
the net investment in mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the year end exchange rates was million at august  and million at august   the potential loss in value of the company s net investment in mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august  and august   amounted to million and million  respectively 
this change would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the company s consolidated balance sheets  unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed 
during  exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately with respect to the us dollar 
the resulting foreign currency translation losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss
