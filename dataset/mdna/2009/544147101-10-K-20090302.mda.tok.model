introductory note for periods presented in this annual report on form k prior to june   lorillard  inc was a wholly owned subsidiary of loews corporation loews  a publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange the nyse 
our results of operations and financial condition were included as a separate reporting segment in loews s financial statements and filings with the sec 
beginning in and through june   loews had also issued a separate class of its common stock  referred to as the carolina group stock  to track the economic performance of loews s interest in lorillard  inc and certain liabilities  costs and expenses of loews and lorillard arising out of or related to tobacco or tobacco related businesses 
on june   we began operating as an independent  publicly traded company pursuant to our separation from loews the separation

table of contents part i item business overview lorillard is the third largest manufacturer of cigarettes in the united states 
founded in  lorillard is the oldest continuously operating tobacco company in the united states 
newport  our flagship menthol flavored premium cigarette brand  is the top selling menthol and second largest selling cigarette brand overall in the united states based on gross units sold in the newport brand accounted for approximately of our sales revenue for the fiscal year ended december  in addition to the newport brand  our product line has five additional brand families marketed under the kent  true  maverick  old gold and max brand names 
these six brands include different product offerings which vary in price  taste  flavor  length and packaging 
in the united states and certain us possessions and territories  we shipped billion cigarettes in we sold our major trademarks outside of the united states in we manufacture all of our products at our greensboro  north carolina facility 
we produce cigarettes for both the premium and discount segments of the domestic cigarette market 
we do not compete in a subcategory of the discount segment that we identify as the deep discount segment 
premium brands are well known  established brands marketed at higher retail prices 
discount brands are generally less well recognized brands marketed at lower retail prices 
we define the deep discount subcategory to include brands sold at the lowest retail prices 
deep discount cigarettes are typically manufactured by smaller companies  relative to us and other major us manufacturers  many of which have no  or significantly lower  payment obligations under the state settlement agreements  consisting of the master settlement agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and states and various other governments and jurisdictions the msa and the settlements of similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota 
in addition  in we entered into a joint venture with swedish match north america to develop and evaluate the opportunity to market a smokeless tobacco product for the us market  called triumph snus 
we commenced test marketing of triumph snus in ohio in january and georgia in may of if successful  our current test marketing may permit us to position triumph snus for broader testing or expanded distribution with limited capital investment

advertising and sales promotion the predominant form of promotion in the industry and for us consists of retail price reduction programs  such as discounting or lowering the price of a pack or carton of cigarettes in the retail store  and free pack 
table of contents with purchase promotions 
these programs are developed  implemented and executed by our sales force through merchandising or promotional agreements with retail chain accounts and independent retailers 
we focus our retail programs in markets and stores reflecting unique potential for increased menthol sales 
our direct buying wholesale customers provide us with information as to the quantities of cigarettes shipped to their retail accounts on a weekly basis 
this data covers approximately of wholesale units shipped by us and our major competitors  and enables us to analyze  plan and execute retail promotion programs in markets and stores that optimize the most efficient and effective return on our promotional investments 
we employ other promotion methods to communicate with our adult consumers as well as with adult smokers of our competitors products 
these promotional programs include the use of direct marketing communications  retail coupons  relationship marketing and promotional materials intended to be displayed at retail 
relationship marketing entails the use of various communication techniques to directly reach adult consumers in order to establish a relationship with them for the purpose of advertising and promoting a product or products 
we use our proprietary database of smokers of our brands and smokers of our competitors brands to reach adult consumers with targeted communications about a given brand through age restricted direct mail and internet programs 
we regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position 
accordingly  sales promotion costs in any particular fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of costs that may be realized in subsequent periods 
advertising plays a relatively lesser role in our overall marketing strategy 
we advertise newport in a limited number of magazines that meet certain requirements regarding the age and composition of their readership 
newport is our only brand that receives advertising and promotion support 
advertising of tobacco products through television and radio has been prohibited since under the state settlement agreements  the participating cigarette manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on their advertising and promotion activities including  among other things prohibiting the targeting of youth in the advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products  banning the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion  limiting each tobacco manufacturer to one event sponsorship during any twelve month period  which may not include major team sports or events in which the intended audience includes a significant percentage of youth  banning all outdoor advertising of tobacco products with the exception of small signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco products  banning tobacco manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and other merchandise that bears a tobacco brand name  subject to specified exceptions  prohibiting the distribution of free samples of tobacco products except within adult only facilities  prohibiting payments for tobacco product placement in various media  and banning gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended gift recipient is an adult 
many states  cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising 
there may be additional local  state and federal legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes in the future 
we cannot predict the impact of such initiatives on our marketing and sales efforts 
we fund a youth smoking prevention program  which is designed to discourage youth from smoking by promoting parental involvement and assisting parents in discussing the issue of smoking with their children 
we are also a founding and principal member of the coalition for responsible tobacco retailing which through its we card program trains retailers in how to prevent the purchase of cigarettes by underage 
table of contents persons 
in addition  we have adopted guidelines established by the national association of attorneys general to restrict advertising in magazines with large readership among people under the age of customers and distribution our field sales personnel are based throughout the united states  and we maintain field sales offices in major cities throughout the united states 
our sales department is divided into regions based on geography and sales territories 
we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors  who in turn service retail outlets  chain store organizations  and government agencies  including the us armed forces 
upon completion of the manufacturing process  we ship cigarettes to public distribution warehouse facilities for rapid order fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers 
we retain a portion of our manufactured cigarettes at our greensboro central distribution center and greensboro cold storage facility for future finished goods replenishment 
as of december   we had approximately direct buying customers servicing more than  retail accounts 
we do not sell cigarettes directly to consumers 
during  and  sales made by us to the mclane company  inc comprised  and  respectively  of our revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than of  or sales 
we do not have any written sales agreements with our customers  including the mclane company  inc we do not have any backlog orders 
most of our customers buy cigarettes on a next day delivery basis 
customer orders are shipped from public distribution warehouses via third party carriers 
we do not ship products directly to retail stores 
in  approximately of our customers purchased cigarettes using electronic funds transfer  which provides immediate payment to us 
raw materials and manufacturing in our production of cigarettes  we use domestic and foreign grown burley and flue cured leaf tobaccos  as well as aromatic tobaccos grown primarily in turkey and other near eastern countries 
we believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf of the type and quality we require at competitive prices from a combination of global sources  and that we are not dependent on any one geographic region or country for our requirements 
an affiliate of reynolds american inc rai manufactures all of our reconstituted tobacco pursuant to our specifications  as set forth in the agreement between us and rai 
reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems  and which is used as a component of cigarette blends 
we purchase our tobacco leaf through tobacco dealers  which contract with leaf growers 
such purchases are made at prevailing market prices in the country of origin 
we direct these dealers in the purchase of tobacco according to our specifications for quality  grade  yield  particle size  moisture content  and other characteristics 
the dealers purchase and process the whole leaf and then dry and package it for shipment to and storage at our danville  virginia facility 
we have not experienced any difficulty in purchasing our requirement of leaf tobacco 
we purchase more than of our domestic leaf tobacco from one dealer  alliance one international  inc if alliance one becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us  we believe that we can readily obtain high quality leaf tobacco from well established  alternative industry sources 
however  we believe that such high quality leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to alliance one 
due to the varying size and quality of annual crops and other economic factors  tobacco prices have historically fluctuated 
in  a federal law eliminated historical us price supports that accompanied production controls which inflated the market price of us tobacco 
we believe the elimination of production controls and price supports has favorably impacted the cost of us tobacco 
we store our tobacco in storage warehouses on our acre danville  virginia facility 
to protect against loss  amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are stored in separate warehouses 
certain types of tobacco used in our blends must be allowed to mature over time to allow natural chemical changes that 
table of contents enhance certain characteristics affecting taste 
because of these aging requirements  we maintain large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times 
we believe our current tobacco inventories are adequately balanced for our present production requirements 
if necessary  we can typically purchase aged tobacco in the open market to supplement existing inventories 
we produce cigarettes at our greensboro  north carolina manufacturing plant  which has a production capacity of approximately million cigarettes per day and approximately billion cigarettes per year 
through various automated systems and sensors  we actively monitor all phases of production to promote quality and compliance with applicable regulations 
research and development we have an experienced research and development team that continuously evaluates new products and line extensions and assesses new technologies and scientific advancements to be able to respond to marketplace demands and developing regulatory requirements 
the team includes scientists  of whom have advanced degrees 
our research and development efforts focus primarily on developing quality products that appeal to adult consumers  studying and developing consumer acceptable products with the potential for reduced exposure to smoke constituents or reduced health risk  identifying and investigating  through the use of internal and external resources  suspect constituents of cigarette products or their components to determine the feasibility of reduction or elimination  maintaining state of the art knowledge about public health and scientific issues related to cigarette products  developing new  or modifying existing  products and processes to promote quality control and to comply with current and anticipated laws and regulations  including investigating ways to reduce cigarette ignition propensity  and collaborating and cooperating with outside public and private scientific institutions and encouraging independent research relating to cigarette products 
tobacco related research activities include analysis of cigarette components  including cigarette paper  filters  tobacco and ingredients  analysis of mainstream and sidestream smoke  and modification of cigarette design 
we employ advanced scientific equipment in our research efforts  including gas chromatographs  mass spectrographs and liquid chromatographs 
we use this equipment to structurally identify and measure the amount of chemical compounds found in cigarette smoke and various tobaccos 
these measurements allow us to better understand the relationship between the tobacco and the smoke yielded from cigarettes 
information technology we are committed to the use of information technology throughout the organization to provide operating effectiveness  cost reduction and competitive advantages 
we believe our system platform provides the appropriate level of information in a timely fashion to effectively manage the business 
we utilize proven technologies while also continuously exploring new technologies consistent with its information technology architecture strategy 
our information technology environment is anchored by a sap enterprise resource planning erp system designed to meet the processing and analysis needs of our core business operations and financial control requirements 
the process control and production methods in our manufacturing operation utilize scanning  radio frequency identification  wireless technologies and software products to monitor and control the manufacturing process 
our primary data center is located at our corporate headquarters and is staffed by an in house team of experienced information technology professionals 
a satellite data center  located at our manufacturing facility  supports our manufacturing environment 
in addition  we have a comprehensive redundancy and disaster recovery plan in place 

table of contents employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees 
as of that date  approximately  of those employees were represented by labor unions covered by three collective bargaining agreements 
local union t of the bakery  confectionery  tobacco workers and grain millers international union afl cio clc represents workers at our greensboro manufacturing plant 
the agreement covering this union expires in march workers at our danville  virginia tobacco storage facility are represented by local union t of the bakery  confectionery  tobacco workers and grain millers international union afl cio clc and local union of the national conference of firemen and oilers seiu afl cio clc 
the current agreements with local union t and local union will expire in april we have historically had an amicable relationship with the unions representing our employees 
we provide a retirement plan  a profit sharing plan and other benefits for our hourly paid employees who are represented by unions 
in addition  we provide to our salaried employees a retirement plan  group life  disability and health insurance program and a savings plan 
we also maintain an incentive compensation plan for certain salaried employees 
intellectual property we believe that our trademarks  including brand names  are important to our business 
we own the patents  trade secrets  know how and trademarks  including our brand names and the distinctive packaging and displays  used by us in our business 
all of our material trademarks are registered with the us patent and trademark office 
rights in these trademarks in the united states will continue indefinitely as long as we continue to use the trademarks 
we consider the blends of tobacco and the flavor formulas used to make our brands to be trade secrets 
these trade secrets are generally not the subject of patents  though various of our manufacturing processes are patented 
we sold the international rights to substantially all of our major brands  including newport  in competition the domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on a brand s price  including the level of discounting and other promotional activities  positioning  consumer loyalty  retail display  quality and taste 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris usa philip morris and rai 
we also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes 
we believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by philip morris and rai which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands 
as a result  in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs  which may constrain sales 
please read the sections entitled item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment and selected industry and market share data beginning on pages and  respectively 
legislation and regulation our business operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  publication of health warnings on cigarette packaging  advertising and sales of tobacco products  restrictions on smoking in public places and fire safety standards 
new legislation and regulations are proposed and reports are published by government sponsored committees and others recommending additional regulation of tobacco products 

table of contents we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals  reports and recommendations 
if they are enacted  certain of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
federal regulation the federal comprehensive smoking education act  which became effective in  requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the following four warning statements  on a rotating basis surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy 
surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health 
surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight 
surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
this law also requires that each company that manufactures  packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the secretary of health and human services a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes 
this list of ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company that uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the ingredients 
in addition  bills have been introduced in congress  including those that would prohibit all tobacco advertising and promotion  require new health warnings on cigarette packages and advertising  authorize the establishment of various anti smoking education programs  provide that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of liability under common or state law  permit state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes  direct the placement of advertising of tobacco products  provide that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business expense  prohibit the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise restrict the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores  by mail or over the internet  impose additional  or increase existing  excise taxes on cigarettes  require that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them  under certain circumstances  to be self extinguishing  and subject cigarettes to regulation in various ways by the us department of health and human services or other regulatory agencies 
in  the us food and drug administration fda published regulations that would have extensively regulated the distribution  marketing and advertising of cigarettes  including the imposition of a wide range of labeling  reporting  record keeping  manufacturing and other requirements 
challenges to the fda s assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes made by us and other manufacturers were upheld by the us supreme court in march when that court ruled that congress did not give the fda authority to regulate tobacco products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
since the supreme court decision  various proposals and recommendations have been made for additional federal and state legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers  including a bill granting the fda authority to regulate tobacco products that was introduced in congress in february the bill  which is supported by 
table of contents philip morris and opposed by us and rai  was considered and approved by the house of representatives in but was not considered by the senate during that congressional session 
it is possible that the full senate and house of representatives will consider and approve the bill in the proposed bill would establish a tobacco scientific advisory panel to evaluate issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes  require larger and more severe health warnings on packs and cartons  ban the use of descriptors on tobacco products  such as low tar and light  require the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers  require pre market approval by the fda for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products  require the reduction or elimination of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes  allow the fda to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes  allow the fda to place more severe restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sales of cigarettes  permit inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation  and grant the fda the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rulemaking process  including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes 
the legislation would allow the fda to reinstate its prior regulations or adopt new or additional regulations 
in february  a committee of the institute of medicine  a private  non profit organization which advises the federal government on medical issues  convened and issued a report recommending that congress enact legislation 
the committee suggested enabling a suitable agency to regulate tobacco related products that purport to reduce exposure to tobacco toxicants or reduce risk of disease  and implement other policies designed to reduce the harm from tobacco use 
the report recommended regulation of all tobacco products  including potentially reduced exposure products  known as preps 
in  certain public health groups petitioned the fda to assert jurisdiction over several prep type products that have been introduced into the marketplace 
these groups assert that claims made by manufacturers of these products allow the fda to regulate the manufacture  advertising and sale of these products as drugs or medical devices under the food drug and cosmetic act 
the agency has received comments on these petitions but has taken no action 
in december  the federal trade commission issued a statement withdrawing its previous guidance allowing the use of the term ftc method to identify the testing protocol used by cigarette manufacturers to ascertain the tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes in advertising 
the statement also set forth ftc s position that it considered the use of certain descriptors like lights and medium in connection with the marketing and sale of cigarettes to be misleading consumers to believe that such cigarettes are safer than other cigarettes not bearing such descriptors 
as a result of such statement  we will no longer list tar and nicotine yield information in our advertising and will include a statement that the use of certain descriptors on our packaging and advertising does not mean that the cigarette in question is any safer than any other flavor or style of cigarette 
environmental tobacco smoke various publications and studies by governmental entities have reported that environmental tobacco smoke ets presents health risks 
in addition  public health organizations have issued statements on the adverse health effects of ets  and scientific papers have been published that address the health problems associated 
table of contents with ets exposure 
various cities and municipalities have restricted public smoking in recent years  and these restrictions have been based at least in part on the publications regarding the health risks believed to be associated with ets exposure 
the governmental entities that have published these reports have included the surgeon general of the united states  first in and again in the report  for instance  concluded that there is no risk free level of exposure to ets 
in  the department of health and human services listed ets as a known human carcinogen 
in  the us environmental protection agency concluded that ets is a human lung carcinogen in adults and causes respiratory effects in children 
agencies of state governments also have issued publications regarding ets  including reports by california entities that were published in  and in the study  the california air resources board determined that ets is a toxic air contaminant 
based on these or other findings  public health concerns regarding ets could lead to the imposition of additional restrictions on public smoking  including bans  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations in the future 
state and local regulation many state  local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars and on airline flights and in the workplace 
this trend has increased significantly since the release of the epa s report regarding ets in two states  massachusetts and texas  have enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes sold in those states to submit an annual report identifying for each brand sold certain added constituents  and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands 
neither law allows for the public release of trade secret information 
a new york law which became effective in june requires cigarettes sold in that state to meet a mandated standard for ignition propensity 
we developed proprietary technology to comply with the standards and were compliant by the effective date 
since the passage of the new york law  an additional states and the district of columbia have passed similar laws utilizing the same technical standards 
the effective dates of these laws range from may to january other similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state and local governments 
we cannot predict the impact which these regulations may have on our business  though if enacted  they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or results of operations in the future 
excise taxes and assessments cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes in the united states and  in general  such taxes have been increasing 
the federal excise tax on cigarettes will increase effective april  to per thousand cigarettes or per pack of cigarettes from per thousand cigarettes or per pack of cigarettes 
state excise taxes  which are levied upon and paid by the distributors  are also in effect in the fifty states  the district of columbia and many municipalities 
increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were implemented in seven states and the district of columbia during and ranged from per pack to per pack 
for the twelve months ended december   the combined state and municipal taxes ranged from to per pack of cigarettes 
a federal law enacted in october repealed the federal supply management program for tobacco growers and compensated tobacco quota holders and growers with payments to be funded by an assessment on tobacco manufacturers and importers 
cigarette manufacturers and importers are responsible for paying of a billion payment to tobacco quota holders and growers over a ten year period 
the law provides that payments will be based on shipments for domestic consumption 

table of contents separation agreement with loews corporation in connection with the separation  we entered into a separation agreement with loews corporation on may  the separation agreement sets forth the relationship between lorillard and loews following the separation  including provisions relating to indemnification and tax allocation between the parties 
indemnification provisions we agreed to indemnify loews and its officers  directors  employees and agents against all costs and expenses arising out of third party claims including  without limitation  attorneys fees  interest  penalties and costs of investigation or preparation for defense  judgments  fines  losses  claims  damages  liabilities  taxes  demands  assessments and amounts paid in settlement based on  arising out of or resulting from the ownership or the operation of our assets and properties  and the operation or conduct of our businesses at any time prior to or following the separation including with respect to any smoking and health claims and litigation  certain tax matters  as discussed below  any other activities in which we may engage  any action or omission by us or any successor entity that causes the separation to become taxable to loews  any breach by us of the separation agreement  any other acts or omissions by us arising out of the performance of our obligations under the separation agreement  misstatements in or omissions from the registration statement filed with regard to the separation  other than misstatements or omissions made in reliance on information relating to and furnished by loews for use in the preparation of such registration statement  and any taxes and related losses resulting from the receipt of any such indemnity payment 
our indemnification obligations  including the tax indemnification obligations described below  are binding on our successors 
we are not permitted to merge  consolidate  transfer or convey all or a significant portion of our properties or assets unless the resulting entity  transferee or successor expressly agrees in writing to be bound by these indemnification obligations 
any equity security or equity interest of lorillard licensing company  llc lorillard licensing  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary and owner of our trademarks  or any interest in the intellectual property owned by lorillard licensing  is deemed a significant portion for purposes of the foregoing 
we also agreed to release loews and its shareholders  officers  directors and employees from any liability owed by any of them to us with respect to acts or events occurring on or prior to the separation date  except with respect to tax matters 
the separation agreement also provides that loews will indemnify us and our officers  directors  employees and agents against losses  including but not limited to  litigation matters  and other claims  based on  arising out of or resulting from any activity that loews and its subsidiaries other than us engage in  any breach by loews of the separation agreement  any other acts or omissions by loews arising out of the performance of its obligations under the separation agreement  and misstatements in or omissions from the registration statement filed with regard to the separation  but only with respect to misstatements or omissions made in reliance on information relating to and furnished by loews for use in the preparation of such registration statement 

table of contents loews agreed to release us and all of our directors  officers and employees from any liability owed by any of us to loews with respect to acts or events occurring on or prior to the separation date  except with respect to tax matters 
tax allocation provisions following the separation  we are no longer included in loews s consolidated group for federal income tax purposes 
in connection with the separation  the separation agreement provides certain tax allocation arrangements  pursuant to which we will indemnify loews for tax liabilities that are allocated to us for taxable periods ending on or before the separation date 
the amount of federal income taxes allocated to us for such periods is generally equal to the federal income taxes that would have been payable by us during such periods if we had filed separate consolidated returns 
in addition  with respect to periods in which we were included in loews s consolidated group  loews will indemnify us with respect to the tax liability of the members of the loews consolidated group other than us 
after the separation  we have the right to be notified of and participate in tax matters for which we are financially responsible under the terms of the separation agreement  though loews will generally control such matters 
the separation agreement imposes restrictions on our ability to engage in certain significant corporate transactions  for a period of two years  that could cause the separation to become taxable to loews 
we  however  may undertake any such action if we first obtain a supplemental ruling from the irs or an unqualified tax opinion of a nationally recognized law firm  in either case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to loews  to the effect that the proposed transaction would not adversely affect the tax free nature of the separation 
the separation agreement also requires us and any successor entity to indemnify loews for any losses resulting from the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax free transaction except if the failure to qualify is solely due to loews s fault 
this indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the action is restricted as described above  or whether we or a potential acquirer obtains a supplemental ruling or an opinion of counsel 
the separation agreement further provides for cooperation between us and loews with respect to additional tax matters  including the exchange of information and the retention of records which may affect the income tax liability of the parties to the separation agreement 
item a 
risk factors as of february   lorillard tobacco is a defendant in approximately  tobacco related lawsuits  including approximately  cases in which lorillard  inc is a co defendant 
these cases  which are extremely costly to defend  could result in substantial judgments against lorillard tobacco and or lorillard  inc numerous legal actions  proceedings and claims arising out of the sale  distribution  manufacture  development  advertising  marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes are pending against lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc  and it is likely that similar claims will continue to be filed for the foreseeable future 
in addition  several cases have been filed against lorillard tobacco and other tobacco companies challenging certain provisions of the master settlement agreement among major tobacco manufacturers and states and various other governments and jurisdictions the msa  and state statutes promulgated to carry out and enforce the msa 
punitive damages  often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars  are specifically pleaded in a number of cases in addition to compensatory and other damages 
it is possible that the outcome of these cases  individually or in the aggregate  could result in bankruptcy 
it is also possible that lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc may be unable to post a surety bond in an amount sufficient to stay execution of a judgment in jurisdictions that require such bond pending an appeal on the merits of the case 
even if lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc are successful in defending some or all of these actions  these types of cases are very expensive to defend 
a material increase in the number of pending claims could significantly increase defense costs and have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition 

table of contents further  adverse decisions in litigations against other tobacco companies could have an adverse impact on the industry  including us 
in several cases in recent years  for example  various courts  including the us supreme court  have considered the ratio of awards of actual damages to those of punitive damages 
in one such case  williams v 
philip morris usa  inc  plaintiff was awarded approximately  in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages  a ratio of more than the case has been the subject of multiple appellate rulings and is again pending before the us supreme court 
we are not a party to williams 
should appellate courts establish binding precedents regarding these or other issues  the conduct of future trials involving us would be affected 
a judgment has been rendered against lorillard tobacco in the scott litigation 
in july  the district court of orleans parish  louisiana  entered an amended final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in scott v 
the american tobacco company  et al 
district court  orleans parish  louisiana  filed may   a class action on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the state of louisiana 
lorillard  inc  which was a party to the case in the past  is no longer a defendant in scott 
the amended final judgment orders defendants  including lorillard tobacco  to pay approximately million to fund a court supervised cessation program for class members 
the amended final judgment also awards post judgment judicial interest that will continue to accrue from june until the judgment either is paid or is reversed on appeal 
as of february   judicial interest totaled approximately million 
defendants have appealed the amended final judgment to the louisiana court of appeal  fourth district 
lorillard tobacco s share of any judgment  including an award of post judgment interest  has not been determined 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax provision of approximately million for this matter 
the florida supreme court s ruling in engle has resulted in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us 
the case of engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co  et al 
circuit court  dade county  florida  filed may  was certified as a class action on behalf of florida residents  and survivors of florida residents  who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction to smoking 
the case was tried between and in a multi phase trial that resulted in verdicts in favor of the class 
during  the florida supreme court issued a ruling that  among other things  determined that the case could not proceed further as a class action 
in february  the trial court entered an order on remand from the florida supreme court that formally decertified the class 
the ruling by the florida supreme court in engle also permitted members of the engle class to file individual claims  including claims for punitive damages 
the florida supreme court held that these individual plaintiffs are entitled to rely on a number of the jury s findings in favor of the plaintiffs in the first phase of the engle trial 
these findings included that smoking cigarettes causes a number of diseases  that cigarettes are addictive or dependence producing  and that the defendants  including lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc  were negligent  breached express and implied warranties  placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous  and concealed or conspired to conceal the risks of smoking 
lorillard tobacco is a defendant in approximately  cases pending in various state and federal courts in florida that were filed by members of the engle class the engle progeny cases  including approximately  cases in which lorillard  inc is a co defendant 
these  cases are filed on behalf of approximately  individual plaintiffs 
as of february   lorillard tobacco was a defendant in several engle progeny cases that have been placed on courts trial calendars or in which specific trial dates have been set 
lorillard  inc is a defendant in some of these cases 
trial schedules are subject to change and it is not possible to predict how many of the engle progeny cases pending against lorillard tobacco or lorillard  inc will be tried during it also is not possible to predict whether some courts will implement procedures that consolidate multiple engle progeny cases for trial 

table of contents the verdict returned in the federal government s reimbursement case  while not final  could impose significant financial burdens on us and adversely affect future sales and profits 
in august  a final judgment and remedial order was entered in united states of america v 
philip morris usa  inc  et al 
us district court  district of columbia  filed september  
the court based its final judgment and remedial order on the government s only remaining claims  which were based on the defendants alleged violations of the racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
lorillard  inc is not a party to this matter  but lorillard tobacco is one of the defendants in the case 
although the verdict did not award monetary damages to the plaintiff  the final judgment and remedial order imposes a number of requirements on the defendants 
such requirements include  but are not limited to  corrective statements by defendants related to the health effects of smoking 
the remedial order also would place certain prohibitions on the manner in which defendants market their cigarette products and would eliminate any use of lights or similar product descriptors 
it is likely that the remedial order  including the prohibitions on the use of the descriptors relating to low tar cigarettes  will negatively affect our future sales and profits 
defendants  including lorillard tobacco  have noticed appeals from the final judgment and the remedial order 
plaintiff also has noticed an appeal from the final judgment 
defendants have received a stay of the judgment and remedial order from the district of columbia court of appeals that will remain in effect while the appeal is proceeding 
as a result of the government s appeal  it is possible that certain of the government s claims or damages could be reinstated 
while trial was underway  the district of columbia court of appeals ruled that plaintiff may not seek to recover profits earned by the defendants  but this ruling could be reconsidered in the present appeal 
prior to trial  the government had estimated that it was entitled to approximately billion from the defendants for its claim to recover profits earned by the defendants 
in its pending appeal  the government has preserved its right to seek review of this claim by the united states supreme court 
during trial  the government sought more than billion for the creation of nationwide smoking cessation  public education and counter marketing programs 
in its verdict  the trial court declined to award such relief 
it is possible that this claim could be reinstated on appeal 
the court of appeals heard argument of the case in august and a ruling could be issued at any time 
a ruling by the united states supreme court could limit the ability of cigarette manufacturers to contend that certain claims asserted against them in product liability litigation are barred 
the supreme court s decision also could encourage litigation involving cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar 
in december  the united states supreme court issued a decision that neither the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act nor the federal trade commission s regulation of cigarettes tar and nicotine disclosures preempts or bars some of plaintiffs claims 
the decision also more broadly addresses the scope of preemption based on the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act  and could significantly limit cigarette manufacturers arguments that certain of plaintiffs other claims in smoking and health litigation  including claims based on the alleged concealment of information with respect to the hazards of smoking  are preempted 
in addition  the supreme court s ruling could encourage litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us  regarding the sale of cigarettes labeled as lights or low tar  and it may limit cigarette manufacturers ability to defend such claims 
the supreme court issued this ruling in a purported lights class action  good v 
altria group  inc we are not a defendant in good 
actions by the federal trade commission could be cited as support for allegations against cigarette manufacturers  including us 
in november  the federal trade commission ftc rescinded its guidance regarding disclosure of tar and nicotine yields and prohibited use of the phrase per ftc method to describe those yields 
in its rescission of guidance  the ftc stated that there is now a consensus among the public health and scientific communities that the cambridge filter method is sufficiently flawed that statements of tar and nicotine yields as measured by that method are not likely to help consumers make informed decisions 
the cambridge filter method is a standardized test utilizing a smoking machine to determine the tar and nicotine  among other constituents  in a particular brand or style of cigarettes 
the ftc further stated that it believes the statements of tar and nicotine yields as measured by this test method are confusing at best  and are likely to mislead 
table of contents consumers who believe they will get proportionately less tar and nicotine from lower rated cigarettes than from higher rated brands 
in addition  the ftc stated that any continued use of cigarette descriptors must not convey an erroneous or unsubstantiated message that a particular cigarette presents a reduced risk of harm or is otherwise likely to mislead consumers 
it is possible that these actions by the ftc could be cited as support for allegations by plaintiffs in pending or future litigation  or encourage additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us 
lorillard tobacco is a defendant in a case that was initially certified as a nationwide class action involving lights cigarettes and that could result in a substantial verdict  if the class certification order is reinstated 
schwab v 
philip morris usa  inc  et al 
us district court  eastern district  new york  filed may   was certified by a federal judge as a nationwide class action on behalf of individuals who purchased light cigarettes 
plaintiffs claims in schwab are based on defendants alleged rico violations in the manufacture  marketing and sale of lights cigarettes 
plaintiffs have estimated damages to the class to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars 
any damages awarded to the plaintiffs based on defendants violation of the rico statute would be multiplied by a factor of three 
in march  a federal court of appeals reversed the class certification ruling 
plaintiffs did not seek further review of this decision and the case has been returned to the eastern district of new york for further proceedings 
we cannot predict future activity in this case 
the us surgeon general has issued a report regarding the risks of cigarette smoking to non smokers that could result in additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  additional restrictions placed on the use of cigarettes  and additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes 
in a report entitled the health consequences of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke a report of the surgeon general   the us surgeon general summarized conclusions from previous surgeon general s reports concerning the health effects of exposure to second hand smoke by non smokers 
according to this report  scientific evidence now supports six major conclusions second hand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke 
children exposed to second hand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome  acute respiratory infections and ear problems 
exposure of adults to second hand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes heart disease and lung cancer 
the scientific evidence indicates that there is no risk free level of exposure to second hand smoke 
many millions of americans  both children and adults  are exposed to second hand smoke in their homes and workplaces 
eliminating smoking in indoor spaces fully protects non smokers from exposure to second hand smoke 
separating smokers from non smokers  cleaning the air  and ventilating buildings cannot eliminate exposures of non smokers to second hand smoke 
this report could form the basis of additional litigation against cigarette manufacturers  including us 
the report could be used to support existing litigation against us or other cigarette manufacturers 
it also is possible that the surgeon general s report could result in additional restrictions placed on cigarette smoking or in additional regulations placed on the manufacture or sale of cigarettes 
it is possible that such additional restrictions or regulations could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states  including sales of our brands 
these developments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 

table of contents the proposed regulation of cigarettes by the food and drug administration may adversely affect our business 
a bill that would grant the fda authority to regulate tobacco products was introduced in congress in february the bill  which is being supported by philip morris and opposed by us and rai  was considered and approved by the house of representatives in  but was not considered by the senate during that congressional session 
it is possible that the full senate and house of representatives will consider and approve the bill in the proposed bill would establish a tobacco scientific advisory panel to evaluate the issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes  require larger and more severe health warnings on packs and cartons  ban the use of descriptors on tobacco products  such as low tar and light  require the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers  require pre market approval by the fda for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products  require the reduction or elimination of nicotine or any other compound in cigarettes  allow the fda to mandate the use of reduced risk technologies in conventional cigarettes  allow the fda to place more severe restrictions on the advertising  marketing and sales of cigarettes  permit inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation  and grant the fda the regulatory authority to consider and impose broad additional restrictions through a rule making process  including a ban on the use of menthol in cigarettes 
it is possible that such additional regulation could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the united states including sales of our brands and increased costs to us  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we believe that such regulation may adversely affect our ability to compete against our larger competitors  including philip morris  who may be able to more quickly and cost effectively comply with these new rules and regulations 
we have substantial payment obligations under litigation settlement agreements which will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and operating income in future periods 
in  lorillard tobacco  philip morris incorporated  brown williamson tobacco corporation and rj reynolds tobacco company the original participating manufacturers entered into the msa with states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
we and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota the initial state settlements and  together with the msa  are referred to as the state settlement agreements 
under the state settlement agreements  we paid billion in and are obligated to pay between and billion in  primarily based on estimated industry volume 
annual payments under the state settlement agreements are required to be paid in perpetuity and are based  among other things  on our domestic market share and unit volume of domestic shipments  with respect to the msa  in the year preceding the year in which payment is due  and  with respect to the initial state settlements  in the year in which payment is due 

table of contents we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation 
we record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements and the provision relating to the scott case  as described in the risk factor a judgment has been rendered against lorillard tobacco in the scott litigation above  we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and  therefore  no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome 
it is possible that our results of operations  cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation 
we face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  brand recognition  brand loyalty  service  marketing  advertising and price 
we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
the competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions  erosion of consumer confidence  competitors introduction of low priced products or innovative products  higher cigarette taxes  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories  and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris and rai 
rai was formed in as a result of the merger of rj reynolds tobacco company now a wholly owned subsidiary of rai and the us operations of brown williamson holdings  inc formerly known as brown williamson tobacco corporation and an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of british american tobacco plc we also compete against numerous other smaller manufacturers or importers of cigarettes 
if our major competitors were to significantly increase the level of price discounts offered to consumers  we could respond by increasing price discounts  which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations 
concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks could adversely affect our business 
some plaintiffs and other sources  including public health agencies  have claimed or expressed concerns that mentholated cigarettes may pose greater health risks than non mentholated cigarettes  including concerns that menthol cigarettes may make it easier to start smoking and harder to quit 
for example  in june  seven former us health secretaries criticized a bill then under consideration in the house of representatives to grant the fda the authority to regulate tobacco products and ban the use of characterizing flavors other than menthol in cigarettes 
the former health secretaries argued that the menthol exemption discriminates against african american smokers who often prefer menthol cigarettes and have higher rates of some smoking related diseases 
in the course of consideration of the bill by a committee of the house of representatives an amendment was offered and rejected which would have banned the use of menthol as an ingredient in cigarettes 
the final bill passed by the house in july  included a provision establishing a tobacco scientific advisory committee to evaluate issues surrounding the use of menthol as a flavoring or ingredient in cigarettes within one year of such committee s establishment 
the bill also would have permitted the fda to ban menthol upon a finding that such prohibition would be appropriate for the public health 
prior to these developments  in the us department of health and human services national institutes of health  center for disease control and prevention and national cancer institute and other public health agencies supported the first conference on menthol cigarettes 
the executive summary of the conference proceedings outlined why it is important to study menthol cigarettes and included statements that menthol s sensation of coolness might result in deeper inhalation and could contribute to increased uptake of inhaled tobacco constituents  including nicotine and cancer causing agents in addition  the center for disease control and prevention has published a pamphlet titled pathways to freedom  winning the fight against tobacco that  under the heading the dangers of menthol states that menthol can make it easier for a 
table of contents smoker to inhale deeply  which may allow more chemicals to enter the lungs 
menthol in cigarettes does not make smoking safer 
in fact  menthol may even make things worse 
since we are the leading manufacturer of mentholated cigarettes in the united states  we could face increased exposure to tobacco related litigation as a result of such allegations 
even if such claims are unsubstantiated  increased concerns about the health impact of mentholated cigarettes could adversely affect our sales  including sales of newport 
any ban or limitation on the use of menthol in cigarettes would adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
we are subject to important limitations on advertising and marketing cigarettes that could harm our competitive position 
television and radio advertisements of tobacco products have been prohibited since under the state settlement agreements  we generally cannot use billboard advertising  cartoon characters  sponsorship of concerts  non tobacco merchandise bearing lorillard s brand names and various other advertising and marketing techniques 
in addition  the msa prohibits the targeting of youth in advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products 
accordingly  we have determined not to advertise our cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of additional restrictions may be imposed or agreed to in the future 
these limitations may make it difficult to maintain the value of an existing brand if sales or market share decline for any reason 
moreover  these limitations significantly impair the ability of cigarette manufacturers  including us  to launch new premium brands 
sales of cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes 
federal excise taxes were last increased in from per pack to per pack 
congress recently enacted and the president signed into law an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes of per pack to per pack  effective april   to finance health insurance for children 
for the twelve months ended december   combined state and local excise taxes ranged from to per pack 
various states and localities have raised the excise tax on cigarettes substantially in recent years 
in addition  increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales were implemented in seven states and the district of columbia during and ranged from per pack to per pack 
it is our expectation that several states will propose further increases in and in subsequent years 
we believe that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes 
in addition  we believe that the new increase in the federal excise tax  as well as possible future increases  the extent of which cannot be predicted  compounded by weakening economic conditions  could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry  including us  and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands 
we are dependent on the domestic cigarette business  which we expect to continue to contract 
although we conduct business in puerto rico  guam and the us virgin islands  our cigarette business in the states of the united states the domestic cigarette market is currently our only significant business 
the domestic cigarette market has generally been contracting and we expect it to continue to contract 
we do not have foreign cigarette sales that could offset these effects  as we sold the international rights to substantially all of our brands  including newport  in as a result of price increases  restrictions on advertising and promotions  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors  industry wide domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound annual rate of approximately during the period through industry wide domestic cigarette shipments decreased by an estimated for compared to  during  compared to  and during compared to we derive most of our revenue from one brand 
our largest selling brand  newport  accounted for approximately of our sales revenue for our principal strategic plan revolves around the marketing and sales promotion in support of the newport brand 
we cannot ensure that we will continue to successfully implement our strategic plan with respect to 
table of contents newport or that implementation of our strategic plan will result in the maintenance or growth of the newport brand 
the use of significant amounts of promotion expenses and sales incentives in response to competitive actions and market price sensitivity may have a material adverse impact on our business 
since  the cigarette market has been increasingly price competitive due to the impact of  among other things  higher state and local excise taxes and the market share of deep discount brands 
in response to these and other competitor actions and pricing pressures  we have engaged in significant use of promotional expenses and sales incentives 
the cost of these measures could have a material adverse impact on our business 
we regularly review the results of our promotional spending activities and adjust our promotional spending programs in an effort to maintain our competitive position 
accordingly  unit sales volume and sales promotion costs in any period are not necessarily indicative of sales and costs that may be realized in subsequent periods 
we rely on a limited number of key executives and may continue to experience difficulty in attracting and hiring qualified new personnel in some areas of our business 
the loss of any of our key employees could adversely affect our business 
other than with respect to our chief executive officer  martin l 
orlowsky  we do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees 
as a tobacco company  we may experience difficulty in identifying and hiring qualified executives and other personnel in some areas of our business 
this difficulty is primarily attributable to the health and social issues associated with the tobacco industry 
the loss of services of any key personnel or our inability to attract and hire personnel with requisite skills could restrict our ability to develop new products  enhance existing products in a timely manner  sell products or manage our business effectively 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  which in turn could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
several of our competitors have developed alternative cigarette products 
certain of the major cigarette makers have developed and marketed alternative cigarette products 
for example  philip morris developed an alternative cigarette  called accord  in which the tobacco is heated rather than burned 
rai has developed and is marketing an alternative cigarette  called eclipse  in which the tobacco is primarily heated  with only a small amount of tobacco burned 
vector tobacco inc is marketing a cigarette offered in several packings with declining levels of nicotine  called quest 
philip morris and rai have indicated that these products may deliver fewer smoke components compared to conventional cigarettes 
we have not marketed similar alternative cigarettes 
should such alternative cigarette products gain a significant share of the domestic cigarette market  we may be at a competitive disadvantage 
we may not be able to develop  produce or commercialize competitive new products and technologies required by regulatory changes or changes in consumer preferences 
consumer health concerns and changes in regulations are likely to require us to introduce new products or make substantial changes to existing products 
for example  states and the district of columbia have enacted legislation requiring cigarette manufacturers to reduce the ignition propensity of their products 
we believe that there may be increasing pressure from public health authorities to develop a conventional cigarette  an alternative cigarette or an alternative tobacco product that provides a demonstrable reduced risk of adverse health effects 
we may not be able to develop a reduced risk product that is acceptable to consumers 
in addition  the costs associated with developing any such new products and technologies could be substantial 
increased restrictions on smoking in public places could adversely affect our sales volume  revenue and profitability 
in recent years  states and many local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit  restrict  or discourage smoking  
table of contents smoking in public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars  and smoking on airline flights and in the workplace 
other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by state and local governments in the future 
although we have no empirical evidence of the effect of such restrictions  we believe that restrictions on smoking in public and other places may lead to a decrease in the number of people who smoke or a decrease in the number of cigarettes smoked by smokers 
increased restrictions on smoking in public and other places may have caused a decrease  and may continue to cause a decrease in the volume of cigarettes that would otherwise be sold by us absent such restrictions  which may have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits 
the availability of counterfeit cigarettes could adversely affect our sales volume  revenue and profitability 
sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the united states  including counterfeits of our newport brand  could adversely impact sales by the manufacturers of the brands that are counterfeited and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands 
additionally  smokers who mistake counterfeit cigarettes for our cigarettes may attribute quality and taste deficiencies in the counterfeit product to our brands and discontinue purchasing our brands 
although we do not believe that sales of counterfeit newport cigarettes have had a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits to date  the availability of counterfeit newport cigarettes  together with substantial increases in excise taxes and other potential price increases which could result in an increase in the availability of counterfeit product  could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits in the future 
we rely on a single manufacturing facility for the production of our cigarettes 
we produce all of our cigarettes at our greensboro  north carolina manufacturing facility 
if our manufacturing plant is damaged  destroyed or incapacitated or we are otherwise unable to operate our manufacturing facility  we may be unable to produce cigarettes and may be unable to meet customer demand  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits 
we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain of our domestic leaf tobacco and reconstituted tobacco 
we purchase approximately of our domestic leaf tobacco through one supplier  alliance one international  inc if alliance one becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to us  we believe that leaf tobacco may not be available at prices comparable to those we pay to alliance one  which could have a material adverse effect on our future profits 
in addition  we purchase all of our reconstituted tobacco from one supplier  which is an affiliate of rai  one of our major competitors 
reconstituted tobacco is a form of tobacco material manufactured as a paper like sheet from small pieces of tobacco that are too small to incorporate into the cigarette directly and may include some tobacco stems  and which is used as a component of cigarette blends 
if rai becomes unwilling or unable to supply us and we are unable to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis  our operations could be disrupted resulting in lower production levels and reduced sales  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume  revenue and profits in the future 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brands and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
our ability to maintain and further build brand recognition is dependent on the continued and exclusive use of our trademarks  service marks  trade dress  trade secrets and other proprietary intellectual property  including our name and logo and the unique features of our tobacco products 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are ineffective  thereby permitting a third party to misappropriate or infringe on our intellectual property  the value of our brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from growing or maintaining market share 

table of contents as an independent public company  we expend significant time and resources to comply with rules and regulations that did not apply to us prior to the separation  including rules related to internal control over financial reporting 
failure to comply with such rules may lead investors to lose confidence in our financial statements  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
as an independent public company following our separation from loews in june  the sarbanes oxley act of and the related rules and regulations of the sec  as well as the rules of the nyse  require us to implement additional corporate governance practices and adhere to a variety of reporting requirements 
compliance with these public company obligations has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and could place additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial  accounting and information systems 
in particular  as a public company  our management is required to conduct an annual evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and include a report of management on our internal control in our annual reports on form k 
in addition  our independent public accounting firm is required to attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
if at any time we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or  if our independent auditors are unable to provide us with an attestation and an unqualified report as to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could result in a decrease in the price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  and of delaware law  may prevent or delay an acquisition of us  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
these provisions include a board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms  elimination of the right of our shareholders to act by written consent  rules regarding how our shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings  the right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
we believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board with time to assess any acquisition proposal 
these provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers 
however  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests and those of our shareholders 
the separation agreement between us and loews contains provisions that may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us 
the tax free nature of the separation may be affected by certain transactions undertaken by us 
in particular  under section e of the internal revenue code  the separation would become taxable to loews if it was determined that or more of the shares of our common stock were acquired  directly or indirectly  as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the separation 
if  as a result of acquisitions of our common stock subsequent to the separation  the separation becomes taxable pursuant to 
table of contents section e  loews would recognize a substantial gain for tax purposes as the separation would be treated as a sale of lorillard for federal income tax purposes 
the separation agreement imposes restrictions on our ability to engage in certain significant corporate transactions  for a period of two years  that could cause the separation to become taxable to loews 
we  however  may undertake any such action if we first obtain a supplemental ruling from the irs or an unqualified tax opinion of a nationally recognized law firm  in either case in form and substance reasonably acceptable to loews  to the effect that the proposed transaction would not adversely affect the tax free nature of the separation 
moreover  the separation agreement requires us and any successor entity to indemnify loews for any losses resulting from the failure of the separation to qualify as a tax free transaction except if the failure to qualify is solely due to loews s fault 
this indemnification obligation applies regardless of whether the action is restricted as described above  or whether we or a potential acquirer obtains a supplemental ruling or an opinion of counsel 
these restrictions and potential indemnification obligations may prevent or discourage other companies from acquiring us 
we are required to indemnify loews against losses and other expenses incurred at any time including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation with respect to our assets  properties and businesses 
in the separation agreement  we have agreed to indemnify loews and its officers  directors  employees and agents against costs and expenses including  but not limited to  litigation matters and other claims based on  arising out of or resulting from  among other things  the ownership or the operation of us and our assets and properties  and the operation or conduct of us and our businesses at any time prior to or following the separation including with respect to smoking and health claims and litigation 
if loews incurs legal or other fees or costs and expenses resulting from the operation of our businesses or otherwise with respect to us  we are required to reimburse loews for such losses and any legal or other fees related thereto  which could be substantial 
these indemnification obligations may discourage third parties from trying to acquire us because our indemnification obligations are binding on our successors and we are prohibited by the separation agreement from merging  consolidating or transferring all or a significant portion of our properties or assets unless the resulting entity  transferee or successor agrees to be bound by these indemnification obligations 
in addition  we could face substantial charges for indemnification payments to loews  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not expect that the separation will alter our legal exposure with respect to tobacco related claims

table of contents the judges that have presided over the cases that have been tried have relied upon an order entered during october by the circuit court of miami dade county  florida 
the october order has been construed by these judges as holding that the flight attendants are not required to prove the substantive liability elements of their claims for negligence  strict liability and breach of implied warranty in order to recover damages 
the court further ruled that the trials of these suits are to address whether the plaintiffs alleged injuries were caused by their exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and  if so  the amount of damages to be awarded 
lorillard tobacco has been a defendant in each of the eight flight attendant cases in which verdicts have been returned 
defendants have prevailed in seven of the eight trials

class action cases lorillard tobacco is a defendant in eight pending cases 
lorillard  inc is a defendant in two of these cases 
lorillard tobacco is a party to both of the cases in which lorillard  inc is a defendant 
in most of the pending cases  plaintiffs seek class certification on behalf of groups of cigarette smokers  or the estates of deceased cigarette smokers  who reside in the state in which the case was filed 
cigarette manufacturers  including lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc  have defeated motions for class certification in a total of cases  of which were in state court and of which were in federal court 
motions for class certification have also been ruled upon in some of the lights cases or in other class actions to which neither lorillard tobacco nor lorillard  inc were parties 
in some of these cases  courts have denied class certification to the plaintiffs  while classes have been certified in other matters 
the scott case 
in one of the class actions pending against lorillard tobacco  scott v 
the american tobacco company  et al 
district court  orleans parish  louisiana  filed may   the members of the class have been awarded damages 
the defendants  including lorillard tobacco  have noticed an appeal from this award  which has been accepted for review by the louisiana court of appeal  fourth circuit 
the appeal is from the amended final judgment entered by the district court in july that ordered defendants to pay approximately million to fund a court supervised cessation program for the members of the certified class 
the amended final judgment also awards post judgment judicial interest that will continue to accrue from june until the judgment either is paid or is reversed on appeal 
as of february   judicial interest totaled approximately million 
lorillard  inc  which was a party to the case in the past  is no longer a defendant in scott 
during  scott was certified a class action on behalf of certain cigarette smokers resident in the state of louisiana who desire to participate in medical monitoring or smoking cessation programs and who began smoking prior to september   or who began smoking prior to may  and allege that defendants undermined compliance with the warnings on cigarette packages 

table of contents trial in scott was heard in two phases 
at the conclusion of the first phase in july  the jury rejected medical monitoring  the primary relief requested by plaintiffs  and returned sufficient findings in favor of the class to proceed to a phase ii trial on plaintiffs request for a state wide smoking cessation program 
phase ii of the trial  which concluded during may  resulted in an award of million to fund cessation programs for louisiana smokers 
in february  the louisiana court of appeal reduced the amount of the award by approximately million  struck an award of prejudgment interest  which totaled approximately million as of december   and limited class membership to individuals who began smoking by september   and whose claims accrued by september  in january  the louisiana supreme court denied plaintiffs and defendants separate petitions for review 
the us supreme court denied defendants request that it review the case in may the case was returned to the trial court  which subsequently entered the amended final judgment 
the defendants  including lorillard tobacco  have appealed the amended final judgment 
should the amended final judgment be sustained on appeal  lorillard tobacco s share of that judgment  including the award of post judgment interest  has not been determined 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax provision of approximately million for this matter which was included in selling  general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income and in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the parties filed a stipulation in the trial court agreeing that an article of louisiana law required that the amount of the bond for the appeal be set at million for all defendants collectively 
the parties further agreed that the plaintiffs have full reservations of rights to contest in the trial court the sufficiency of the bond on any grounds 
defendants collectively posted a surety bond in the amount of million  of which lorillard tobacco secured  or million 
while lorillard tobacco believes the limitation on the appeal bond amount is valid as required by louisiana law  in the event of a successful challenge the amount of the appeal bond could be set as high as of the judgment and judicial interest combined 
if such an event occurred  lorillard tobacco s share of the appeal bond has not been determined 
the engle case 
the case of engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co  et al 
circuit court  miami dade county  florida  filed may   was certified as a class action on behalf of florida residents  and survivors of florida residents  who were injured or died from medical conditions allegedly caused by addiction to smoking 
during and  a jury returned verdicts that  among other things  awarded the certified class billion in punitive damages  including billion against lorillard tobacco 
during  the florida supreme court vacated the punitive damages award  determined that the case could not proceed further as a class action and ordered decertification of the class 
the trial court entered orders during that formally decertified the class 
during july  plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case and engle is no longer pending 
the florida supreme court s decision also reinstated awards of actual damages to two of the three individuals whose claims were heard during the second phase of the engle trial 
one individual was awarded million and the second was awarded million 
both individuals informed the court that they would not seek punitive damages 
these verdicts were paid during february lorillard tobacco s payment was approximately million for the verdicts and the interest that accrued since november other class action cases 
in one of the cases pending against lorillard tobacco  brown v 
the american tobacco company  inc  et al 
superior court  san diego county  california  filed june   the court initially certified the case as a class action but it subsequently granted defendants motion for class decertification 
the class decertification order has been affirmed on appeal  but the california supreme court has agreed to hear the case 
the class originally certified in brown was composed of residents of california who smoked at least one of defendants cigarettes between june  and april  and who were exposed to defendants marketing and advertising activities in california 
lights class actions 
cigarette manufacturers are defendants in another group of approximately cases in which plaintiffs claims are based on the allegedly fraudulent marketing of light or ultra light 
table of contents cigarettes 
classes have been certified in some of these matters 
in one of the pending lights cases  good v 
altria group  inc  et al  the us supreme court ruled that federal law does not prohibit plaintiffs from challenging statements authorized by the federal trade commission about tar and nicotine yields that have been made in cigarette advertisements 
lorillard tobacco is a defendant in one purported lights class action  schwab v 
philip morris usa  inc  et al 
lorillard  inc is not a party to any of the purported lights class actions 
the schwab case 
in the case of schwab v 
philip morris usa  inc  et al 
us district court  eastern district  new york  filed may  plaintiffs base their claims on defendants alleged violations of the rico statute in the manufacture  marketing and sale of light cigarettes 
plaintiffs estimated damages to the class in the hundreds of billions of dollars 
any damages awarded to the plaintiffs based on defendants violation of the rico statute would be trebled 
in september  the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification and certified a nationwide class action on behalf of purchasers of light cigarettes 
in march  the second circuit court of appeals reversed the class certification order and ruled that the case may not proceed as a class action 
schwab has been returned to the us district court for the eastern district of new york for further proceedings  but the future activity in this matter  if any  is not known 
lorillard  inc is not a party to this case 
reimbursement cases lorillard tobacco is a defendant in the four reimbursement cases that are pending in the us and it has been named as a party to a case in israel 
lorillard  inc is a co defendant in two of the four cases pending in the us plaintiffs in the case in israel have attempted to assert claims against lorillard  inc us federal government action in august  the us district court for the district of columbia issued its final judgment and remedial order in the federal government s reimbursement suit united states of america v 
philip morris usa  inc  et al  us district court  district of columbia  filed september  
the verdict concluded a bench trial that began in september lorillard tobacco  other cigarette manufacturers  two parent companies and two trade associations are defendants in this action 
lorillard  inc is not a party to this case 
in its verdict  the court determined that the defendants  including lorillard tobacco  violated certain provisions of the rico statute  that there was a likelihood of present and future rico violations  and that equitable relief was warranted 
the government was not awarded monetary damages 
the equitable relief included permanent injunctions that prohibit the defendants  including lorillard tobacco  from engaging in any act of racketeering  as defined under rico  from making any material false or deceptive statements concerning cigarettes  from making any express or implied statement about health on cigarette packaging or promotional materials these prohibitions include a ban on using such descriptors as low tar  light  ultra light  mild  or natural  and from making any statements that low tar  light  ultra light  mild  or natural or low nicotine cigarettes may result in a reduced risk of disease 
the final judgment and remedial order also requires the defendants  including lorillard tobacco  to make corrective statements on their websites  in certain media  in point of sale advertisements  and on cigarette package inserts concerning the health effects of smoking  the addictiveness of smoking  that there are no significant health benefits to be gained by smoking low tar  light  ultra light  mild  or natural cigarettes  that cigarette design has been manipulated to ensure optimum nicotine delivery to smokers  and that there are adverse effects from exposure to secondhand smoke 
if the final judgment and remedial order are not modified or vacated on appeal  the costs to lorillard tobacco for compliance could exceed million 
defendants have appealed to the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit which has stayed the judgment and remedial order while the appeal is proceeding 
the government also has noticed an appeal from the final judgment 
the court of appeals heard oral argument of the consolidated appeal in october and a ruling could be issued at any time 
while trial was underway  the district of columbia court of appeals ruled that plaintiff may not seek return of profits 
in its present appeal  the government has preserved its right to seek review of this claim by the united states supreme court 
prior to trial  the government had estimated that it was entitled to approximately billion from the defendants for its return of profits claim 
in addition  the government sought during trial more than billion for the creation of nationwide smoking cessation  public education 
table of contents and counter marketing programs 
in its verdict  the trial court declined to award such relief 
it is possible that this claim could be reinstated on appeal 
settlement of state reimbursement litigation on november   lorillard tobacco and the other original participating manufacturers entered into the msa with states  the district of columbia  the commonwealth of puerto rico  guam  the us virgin islands  american samoa and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands to settle the asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and certain other claims of those states 
these settling entities are generally referred to as the settling states 
the original participating manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota  which together with the msa are referred to as the state settlement agreements 
the state settlement agreements provide that the agreements are not admissions  concessions or evidence of any liability or wrongdoing on the part of any party  and were entered into by the original participating manufacturers to avoid the further expense  inconvenience  burden and uncertainty of litigation 
from time to time  lawsuits have been brought against us and other participating manufacturers to the msa  or against one or more of the states  challenging the validity of the msa on certain grounds  including as a violation of the antitrust laws 
see msa related antitrust suit below 
we believe that the state settlement agreements will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and operating income in future years 
the degree of the adverse impact will depend  among other things  on the rates of decline in domestic cigarette sales in the premium price and discount price segments  our share of the domestic premium price and discount price cigarette segments  and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to significant payment obligations under the state settlement agreements 
please read item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations state settlement agreements beginning on page and note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page filter cases in addition to the above  claims have been brought against lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc by individuals who seek damages resulting from their alleged exposure to asbestos fibers that were incorporated into filter material used in one brand of cigarettes manufactured by lorillard tobacco for a limited period of time ending more than years ago

tobacco related antitrust cases indirect purchaser suits 
approximately antitrust suits were filed in and on behalf of putative classes of consumers in various state courts against cigarette manufacturers  including lorillard tobacco 
the suits all alleged that the defendants entered into agreements to fix the wholesale prices of cigarettes in violation of state antitrust laws which permit indirect purchasers  such as retailers and consumers  to sue under price fixing or consumer fraud statutes 
more than states permit such suits 
lorillard  inc was not named as a defendant in any of these cases 
lorillard tobacco was a defendant in all but one of these indirect purchaser cases 
three indirect purchaser suits  in new york  florida and michigan  thereafter were dismissed by courts in those states  and the plaintiffs withdrew their appeals 
the actions in all other states  except for new mexico and kansas  were voluntarily dismissed 

table of contents in the kansas case  the district court of seward county certified a class of kansas indirect purchasers in in july  the court issued an order confirming that fact discovery was closed  with the exception of privilege issues that the court determined  based on a special master s report  justified further fact discovery 
in october  the court denied all of the defendants privilege claims  and the kansas supreme court thereafter denied a petition seeking to overturn that ruling 
additional fact discovery  as approved by the court  currently is ongoing  and further expert discovery is anticipated in the first half of no date has been set by the court for dispositive motions and trial 
a decision granting class certification in new mexico was affirmed by the new mexico court of appeals in february as ordered by the trial court  class notice was sent out in october the new mexico plaintiffs were permitted to rely on discovery produced in the kansas case 
in june  the new mexico trial court granted summary judgment to all defendants  and the suit was dismissed 
the new mexico court of appeals affirmed dismissal of all claims against lorillard tobacco in december  although claims against its major competitors were reinstated 
plaintiff has not sought to reinstate the claims against lorillard tobacco and the time for such action has expired 
accordingly  the new mexico suit has now been concluded as against lorillard tobacco 
msa related antitrust suit 
in october  lorillard tobacco was named as a defendant in an action filed in the western district of kentucky  vibo corporation  inc d b a general tobacco v 
conway  et al 
the suit alleges that the named defendants  which include state and territorial attorneys generals and tobacco manufacturers  violated the federal sherman antitrust act of  as amended the sherman act  by entering into and participating in the msa 
the plaintiff alleges that msa participants  like it  that were not in existence when the msa was executed in  but subsequently became participants  are unlawfully required to pay significantly more sums to the states than companies that joined the msa within days after its execution 
in addition to the sherman act claim  plaintiff has raised a number of constitutional claims against the states 
plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment in its favor on all claims  an injunction against the continued enforcement of the msa  treble damages against the tobacco manufacturer defendants  including lorillard tobacco  and damages and injunctive relief against the states  including contract recession and restitution 
in december  the court dismissed the complaint against all defendants  including lorillard tobacco 
the court has not yet entered its final judgment

defenses we believe that lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc have valid defenses to the cases pending against each of them 
we also believe lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc have valid bases for appeal should any adverse verdicts be returned against either of them 
lorillard tobacco is a defendant in approximately  pending product liability cases 
lorillard  inc is a co defendant in approximately  of these cases 
while each party intends to defend vigorously all litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
plaintiffs have prevailed in several product liability cases  as noted above 
it is possible that one or more of the pending actions could be decided unfavorably as to lorillard tobacco  lorillard  inc or the other defendants 
lorillard tobacco and lorillard  inc may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if either believe it is appropriate to do so 
we cannot predict the outcome of pending litigation 
some plaintiffs have been awarded damages from cigarette manufacturers at trial 
while some of these awards have been overturned or reduced  other damages awards have been paid after the manufacturers have exhausted their appeals 
these awards and other litigation activities against cigarette manufacturers continue to receive media attention 
in addition  health issues related to tobacco products also continue to receive media attention 
it is possible  for example  that the verdict in united states of america v 
philip morris usa  inc  et al  which made many adverse findings regarding the conduct of the defendants  including lorillard tobacco  could form the basis of allegations by other plaintiffs or additional judicial findings against cigarette manufacturers 
in addition  the ruling in good v 

table of contents altria group  inc  et al 
could result in further lights litigation 
any such developments could have an adverse affect on the ability of lorillard tobacco or lorillard  inc to prevail in smoking and health litigation and could influence the filing of new suits against lorillard tobacco or lorillard  inc we also cannot predict the type or extent of litigation that could be brought against us  or against other cigarette manufacturers in the future 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements and scott as described above  management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and  therefore  no material provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome 
it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular quarterly or annual period or its financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of certain pending litigation

loews is a defendant in four pending product liability cases 
one of these is a reimbursement case in israel  while the three other cases are on file in us courts 
one of the cases pending against loews in the us is a conventional product liability case  while the two other suits are purported class action cases 
lorillard tobacco also is a defendant in each of the four product liability cases in which loews is involved 
pursuant to the separation agreement  we will be required to indemnify loews for the amount of any losses and any legal or other fees in respect of such cases

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the notes related to those financial statements and item selected financial data appearing herein 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in the forward looking statements  item a 
risk factors  business environment and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the financial statements include our subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions 
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap  applied on a consistent basis 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements and related notes include accruals for tobacco settlement costs  legal expenses and litigation costs  sales incentive programs  income taxes and share based compensation  the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the valuation of pension assets 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  evaluation of current trends  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances at the time 
we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment  actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and equity 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales  net of sales incentives  is recognized at the time ownership of the goods transfers to customers and collectability is reasonably assured 
federal excise taxes are recognized on a gross basis and are included in both sales and cost of sales 
sales incentives include retail price discounts  coupons and retail display allowances and are recorded as a reduction of revenue based on amounts estimated as due to customers and consumers at the end of a period based primarily on use and redemption rates 
tobacco settlement costs in  we and the other original participating manufacturers entered into the msa with states and various other governments and jurisdictions to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims 
we and certain other us tobacco product manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by mississippi  florida  texas and minnesota which are referred to as the initial state settlements  and together with the msa  are referred to as the state settlement agreements 
our portion of ongoing adjusted payments and legal fees is based on our relative share of the settling manufacturers domestic cigarette shipments  with respect to the msa  in the year preceding that in which the payment is due  and  with respect to the initial state settlements  in the year in which payment is due 
we record our portion of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of sales as product is shipped 
please read state settlement agreements beginning on page for additional information 

table of contents tobacco and other litigation we and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation 
plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages  although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars 
plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages  statutory damages  return of profits  equitable and injunctive relief  and medical monitoring  among other damages 
we believe that we have valid defenses to the cases pending against us 
we also believe we have valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against us 
while we intend to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably 
we may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if we believe it is appropriate to do so 
we record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements and the provision relating to the scott case  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page  our management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of material pending litigation and  therefore  no material provision has been made in our consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome 
it is possible that our results of operations  cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending or future litigation 
defense costs associated with product liability claims are a significant component of our selling  general and administrative expenses and are accrued as incurred 
defense costs may increase in future periods  in part  as a result of the engle progeny cases as described under item legal proceedings 
numerous factors affect product liability defense costs in any given period 
the principal factors are as follows the number and types of cases filed and appealed  the number of cases tried and appealed  the development of the law  the application of new or different theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel  and litigation strategy and tactics 
please read the section entitled item legal proceedings beginning on page and in note to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page for detailed information regarding tobacco litigation affecting us 
share based compensation expense we recognize share based compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights in accordance with sfas no 
r share based payment using the modified prospective transition method 
we applied the transition method in calculating our pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb future tax deficiencies as provided by fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  the exercise price per share may not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant 
we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate  recognizing compensation expense for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to value the options granted under our option plan 

table of contents prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to follow accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options and awards 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense was recognized when the exercise prices of options equaled the fair value market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  required disclosure of pro forma information regarding option grants made to employees 
sfas no 
specified certain valuation techniques that produced estimated compensation charges for purposes of valuing stock option grants 
these amounts were not included in our consolidated statements of income  in accordance with apb no 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilized current market information and liability information  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the discount rate was determined by projecting the plan s expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation  discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality bonds as of the measurement date  and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that resulted in the same projected benefit obligation 
the salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  asset allocations and management s expectation of the future economic environment 
our major assumptions are set forth in note to our consolidated audited financial statements beginning on page for  changes in the rates for the pension plans would have had the following impact on our pension expense a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our pension expense by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our pension expense by approximately million  and an increase of basis points in the future salary growth rate would have increased our net pension expense by approximately million 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we evaluate and may adjust these accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the consolidated tax provision includes the impact of changes to accruals that are considered appropriate 

table of contents in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with application of sfas no 
by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet before any part of the benefit of that position is recognized in the financial statements 
specifically  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  along with accounting for the related interest and penalties 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening earnings retained in the business 
we adopted fin on january  and recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million that was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of earnings retained in the business 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost  determined on a last in  first out lifo basis  or market 
the inventory of leaf tobacco is classified as a current asset in accordance with generally recognized trade practice although  due to the duration of the aging processes  a significant portion of the tobacco on hand will not be sold or used within one year 
recent accounting pronouncements please read recently adopted accounting pronouncements beginning on page business environment participants in the us tobacco industry  including us  face a number of issues that have adversely affected their results of operations and financial condition in the past and will continue to do so  including a substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars  as well as equitable and injunctive relief  arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes  addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke  including claims for economic damages relating to alleged misrepresentation concerning the use of descriptors such as lights  as well as other alleged damages 
substantial annual payments continuing in perpetuity  and significant restrictions on marketing and advertising have been agreed to and are required under the terms of the state settlement agreements 
the state settlement agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major us cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on ours and their ability to market and sell cigarettes 
the continuing contraction of the domestic cigarette market  in which we currently conduct our only significant business 
as a result of price increases  restrictions on advertising  promotions and smoking in public and private facilities  increases in regulation and excise taxes  health concerns  a decline in the social acceptability of smoking  increased pressure from anti tobacco groups and other factors  domestic cigarette shipments have decreased at a compound rate of approximately from the twelve months ended december  through the twelve months ended december  increases in cigarette prices since have led to an increase in the volume of discount and  specifically  deep discount cigarettes 
cigarette price increases have been driven by increases in state and local excise taxes and by manufacturer price increases 
price increases have led  and continue to lead  to high levels of discounting and other promotional activities for premium brands 
deep discount brands have grown from an estimated share in of less than to an estimated for the 
table of contents twelve months ended december   and continue to be a significant competitive factor in the domestic market 
we do not have sufficient empirical data to determine whether the increased price of cigarettes has deterred consumers from starting to smoke or encouraged them to quit smoking  but it is likely that increased prices and smoking restrictions may have had an adverse effect on consumption and may continue to do so 
substantial federal  state and local excise taxes which are reflected in the retail price of cigarettes 
for the twelve months ended december   the federal excise tax was per pack and combined state and local excise taxes ranged from to per pack 
for the twelve months ended december   excise tax increases that ranged from per pack to per pack were implemented in seven states and the district of columbia 
congress recently enacted and the president signed into law an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes by per pack to per pack to finance health insurance for children 
we believe that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that the new increase in the federal excise tax  as well as possible future increases  the extent of which cannot be predicted  could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry  including us  and an increased sales shift toward deep discount cigarettes rather than premium brands 
in addition  we  other cigarette manufacturers and importers are required to pay an assessment under a federal law designed to fund payments to tobacco quota holders and growers 
substantial and increasing regulation of the tobacco industry and governmental restrictions on smoking 
in recent years  states and many local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit  restrict  or discourage smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars  on airline flights and in the workplace 
other similar laws and regulations are currently under consideration and may be enacted by state and local governments in the future 
a bill was introduced in february in the us congress to grant the fda authority to regulate tobacco products 
the bill was approved by the house of representatives in  but was not considered by the senate during that year 
it is possible that the full senate and house of representatives will consider and approve the bill in we believe that fda regulations  if enacted by the fda after the bill becomes law  could among other things result in new restrictions or a prohibition on the use of menthol as a flavor or ingredient in cigarettes  affect the manner in which cigarettes can be advertised and marketed  require larger and more severe health warnings on cigarette packaging  restrict the level of tar and nicotine contained in or yielded by cigarettes and may alter the way cigarette products are developed and manufactured 
we also believe that any such proposals  if enacted  would provide our larger competitors with a competitive advantage 
in december  the federal trade commission issued a statement withdrawing its previous guidance allowing the use of the term ftc method to identify the testing protocol used by cigarette manufacturers to ascertain the tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes on advertising 
the statement also set forth ftc s position that it considered the use of certain descriptors like lights and medium in connection with the marketing and sale of cigarettes to be misleading consumers to believe that such cigarettes are safer than other cigarettes not bearing such descriptors 
as a result of such statement  we will no longer list tar and nicotine yield information in our advertising and will include a statement that the use of certain descriptors on our packaging and advertising does not mean that the cigarette in question is any safer than any other flavor or style of cigarette 
the domestic market for cigarettes is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on a brand s price  including the level of discounting and other promotional activities  positioning  consumer loyalty  retail display  quality and taste 
our principal competitors are the two other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris and rai 
we also compete with numerous other smaller manufacturers and importers of cigarettes  including deep discount cigarette manufacturers 
we believe our ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained in some marketing areas as a result of retail merchandising contracts offered by philip morris and rai which limit the retail shelf space available to our brands 
as a result  in some retail locations we are limited in competitively supporting our promotional programs  which may constrain sales

our cash flow from investing activities provided cash of million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flow provided by investing activities in is primarily due to a decrease in the level of investment purchases and sales

we paid cash dividends to shareholders of million and on million on september  and december   respectively 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares under our repurchase program at a cost of million 
that program is complete 

table of contents liquidity we believe that cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable us to meet our obligations under the state settlement agreements and to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we cannot predict our cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  if necessary  and can make no assurance that we will be able to meet all of those requirements 
our pension plans assets were negatively impacted by declining equity markets in the rate of return on our pension assets in was a negative 
our pension expense was million in and we anticipate pension expense of approximately million in we contributed million to our pension plans in and anticipate a contribution of million in other than commercial obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business  we have no indebtedness for borrowed money as of december  we believe that it would be appropriate for a company of our size and financial characteristics to have a prudent level of debt as a component of our capital structure in order to reduce our total cost of capital and improve total shareholder returns 
accordingly  we expect that we will seek to raise between million and billion of debt financing  although the structure  timing and amount of such indebtedness has not yet been determined and will depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to the prevailing credit and interest rate environment  our cash requirements  and other business  financial and tax considerations 
the proceeds of any such debt financing may be used to fund stock repurchases  acquisitions  dividends or for other general corporate purposes 
we presently have no commitments or agreements with or from any third party regarding any debt financing transaction and no assurance can be given that we will ultimately pursue any debt financing or  if pursued  that we will be able to obtain debt financing at the suggested levels or on attractive terms 
state settlement agreements the state settlement agreements require us and the other original participating manufacturers philip morris incorporated  brown williamson tobacco corporation and rj reynolds tobacco company to make aggregate annual payments of billion in perpetuity  subject to adjustment for several factors described below 
in addition  the original participating manufacturers are required to pay plaintiffs attorneys fees  subject to an aggregate annual cap of million  as well as an additional aggregate amount of up to million in each year through these payment obligations are several and not joint obligations of each of the original participating manufacturers 
our obligations under the state settlement agreements will materially adversely affect our cash flows and operating income in future years 
both the aggregate payment obligations of the original participating manufacturers  and our payment obligations  individually  under the state settlement agreements are subject to adjustment for several factors which include inflation  aggregate volume of original participating manufacturers cigarette shipments  other original participating manufacturers and our market share  and aggregate original participating manufacturers operating income  allocated to such manufacturers that have operating income increases 
the inflation adjustment increases payments on a compounded annual basis by the greater of or the actual total percentage change in the consumer price index for the preceding year 
the inflation adjustment is measured starting with inflation for the volume adjustment increases or decreases payments based on the increase or decrease in the total number of cigarettes shipped in or to the us states  the district of columbia and puerto rico by the original participating manufacturers during the preceding year compared to the base year shipments 
if volume has increased  the volume adjustment would increase the annual payment by the same percentage as the number of cigarettes shipped exceeds the base number 
if volume has decreased  the volume adjustment would decrease the annual payment by of the percentage 
table of contents reduction in volume 
in addition  downward adjustments to the annual payments for changes in volume may  subject to specified conditions and exceptions  be reduced in the event of an increase in the original participating manufacturers aggregate operating income from domestic sales of cigarettes over base year levels established in the state settlement agreements  adjusted for inflation 
any adjustments resulting from increases in operating income would be allocated among those original participating manufacturers who have had increases 
during  we paid billion under the state settlement agreements  primarily based on volume 
in addition  in april  we deposited million  in an interest bearing escrow account in accordance with procedures established in the msa pending resolution of a claim by us and the other original participating manufacturers that they are entitled to reduce their msa payments based on a loss of market share to non participating manufacturers 
most of the states that are parties to the msa are disputing the availability of the reduction and we believe that this dispute will ultimately be resolved by judicial and arbitration proceedings 
our million reduction is based upon the original participating manufacturers collective loss of market share in in april of and  we had previously deposited million and million  respectively  in the same escrow account discussed above  which was based on a loss of market share in and to non participating manufacturers 
we and other original participating manufacturers have the right to claim additional reductions of msa payments in subsequent years under provisions of the msa 
we anticipate the amount payable in will be approximately billion to billion  primarily based on estimated industry volume 
contractual cash payment obligations the following table presents the contractual cash payment obligations of lorillard as of december  more less than than total year years years years in millions leaf tobacco purchase commitments operating lease obligations machinery purchase commitments total in addition to the obligations presented in the table above  as of december   we believe that it is reasonably possible that payments of up to million may be made to various tax authorities in the next twelve months related to gross unrecognized tax benefits 
we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that may result in cash settlements for periods beyond twelve months 
as previously discussed  we have entered into the state settlement agreements which impose a stream of future payment obligations on us and the other major us cigarette manufacturers 
our portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments  including fees to settling plaintiffs attorneys  are based on a number of factors which are described above 
our cash payment under the state settlement agreements in amounted to billion and we estimate our cash payments in under the state settlement agreements will be between billion and billion  primarily based on estimated industry volume 
payment obligations are not incurred until the related sales occur and therefore are not reflected in the above table

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in financial instruments that involve market risk 
our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented below for each class of financial instrument we held at december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the rate of adverse market movement represents a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
the market risk exposure represents the potential loss in carrying value and pretax impact to future earnings caused by the hypothetical change in price 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has the responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk 
interest rate risk 
our investments  which are included in cash and cash equivalents  consist of treasury money market funds and repurchase agreements with financial institutions  which agreements are collateralized by treasury securities on deposit with the company equal to of the principal investment 
those investments are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
a sensitivity analysis  based on a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates on our average investments  would cause an increase or decrease in pre tax income of approximately million
