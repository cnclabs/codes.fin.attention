item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information contained in this document  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  made pursuant to section e of the exchange act  that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements whenever they appear in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these and any other forward looking statements 
factors that could contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those cautionary statements and other factors set forth in item a risk factors and elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
preparation of financial statements and use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  investments  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets  bad debts  income taxes  pensions  warranties  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  title and risk of loss have passed  delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss generally pass to our customers upon shipment or at delivery destination point 
in circumstances where either title or risk of loss pass upon destination  acceptance or cash payment  we defer revenue recognition until such events occur 
our equipment includes embedded software which is considered incidental to the product 
revenue is recognized upon shipment or at delivery destination point  provided that customer acceptance criteria can be demonstrated prior to shipment 
certain contracts require us to perform tests of the product to ensure that performance meets the published product specifications or customer requested specifications  which are generally conducted prior to shipment 
where the criteria cannot be demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance has been received 
for multiple element arrangements we defer the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract 
we also defer the portion of the sales price that is not due until acceptance  which represents deferred profit 
for a delivered item to be considered a separate unit  the delivered item must have value to the customer on a standalone basis  there must be objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement and the delivery or performance of the undelivered item must be considered probable and substantially in our control 
fair value is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
our post shipment obligations include installation  training services  one year standard warranties  and extended warranties 
installation does not alter the product capabilities  does not require specialized skills or tools and can be performed by the customers or other vendors 
installation is typically provided within five to fifteen days of product shipment and is completed within one to two days thereafter 
training services are optional and do not affect the customer s ability to use the product 
we defer revenue for the fair value of installation and training 
extended warranties constitute warranty obligations beyond one year and we defer revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
our products are generally subject to warranty and related costs of the warranty are provided for in cost of revenue when product revenue is recognized 
we classify shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
we generally do not provide our customers with contractual rights of return for any of our products 
for transactions involving the sale of software which is not incidental to the product  revenue is recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
in instances where an arrangement contains multiple elements  revenue is deferred related to the undelivered elements to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for such elements 
in instances where vsoe does not exist for one or more of the undelivered elements of an arrangement  all revenue related to the arrangement is deferred until all elements have been delivered 
vsoe is the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue for the separate elements is only recognized where the functionality of the undelivered element is not essential to the delivered element 
for certain contracts eligible for contract accounting under sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method based upon the percentage of incurred costs to estimated total costs 
these arrangements require significant production  modification or customization 
in all cases  changes to total estimated costs and anticipated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
with respect to contract change orders  claims or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
such amounts are only included in the contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is reasonably assured  generally upon receipt of a customer approved change order 
inventories inventories  which include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  we use consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value 
we record a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write downs or write offs are identified through the quarterly review process 
the inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand  product mix and possible alternative uses 
equity incentive and stock purchase plans effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provision of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the first quarter of fiscal includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   and is calculated based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provision of sfas r 
as required by sfas r  we have made an estimate of expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those stock based compensation awards expected to vest 
the cumulative effect of the initial adoption of sfas r was not material 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we recognized stock based compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we have applied provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
on may   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain outstanding  unvested out of the money stock options awarded to employees  officers and other eligible participants under our various stock option plans in effect at that time 
the stock options that were accelerated had exercise prices that were in excess of  the closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on may  and ranged in exercise price from to per share 
as a result of the vesting acceleration  options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable immediately and we reduced the compensation expense we otherwise would have been required to record under sfas r by approximately million in the aggregate on a pre tax basis over fiscal years  and income taxes on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by jurisdiction and assess the need for a valuation allowance 
as a result of this review  undertaken at december   we concluded under applicable accounting criteria that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized and established a valuation allowance in several jurisdictions  most notably the united states 
due to the continued uncertainty of realization  we have maintained our valuation allowance at december  and investments we account for our investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
and fasb staff position nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
on a quarterly basis we review our investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other than temporary impairment 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we have determined that we do not intend to hold certain marketable securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery in market value and recognized an other than temporary impairment loss in the amount of million  in the year ended december   primarily related to mortgage and asset backed debt securities 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities 
as defined in sfas no 
 fair value is the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we use the market and income approach techniques to value our financial instruments 
sfas no 
requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date 
level inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly as of the reporting date 
for example  a common approach for valuing fixed income securities is the use of matrix pricing 
matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices  and therefore is considered a level input 
level unobservable inputs that are not supported by market data 
unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available  which might include teradyne s own data 
as a result of our november  acquisition of eagle test  we acquired million of auction rate securities ars at fair value million par value 
in addition  we acquired the right ubs put to sell our ars back to ubs at par plus interest  at our sole discretion  during a two year period beginning on june   and received an option to borrow up to of the fair value of the ars at no cost 
beginning in february and continuing through december   the securities in our acquired ars portfolio have experienced failed auctions  resulting in inability to sell these securities 
consequently  as set forth in the trust indentures  the coupon rate resets to a contractual rate which may not equal the current market rate 
a failed auction results in a lack of liquidity in the securities but does not necessarily represent a deterioration of the credit quality of the issuer 
all of our ars  are aaa  aa or a rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a us department of education agency or a third party insurer 
at december   the underlying securities for the ars have remaining maturities ranging from five to thirty one years 
substantially  all of these securities are collateralized by student loans 
the estimated fair value of our ars portfolio was million as of december  because the ubs put is expected to allow us to sell our ars securities at par within a relatively short time horizon and provides ubs with the ability to require us to sell the securities to them at any time between acceptance of the ubs put through july  we do not anticipate holding these investments to the earlier of maturity or redemption by the issuer 
we intend to exercise the ubs put and require ubs to repurchase our ars at par at the earliest possible time  june as a result  as of the eagle test acquisition date november   we classified the ars as trading securities under sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a loss of million in interest expense and other  net in our consolidated statement of operations for the decrease in the ars fair value from november  to december  future changes in fair value of the ars will be recorded in operating results 
in determining the fair value of our ars and other investments we utilize the provisions of sfas no 
in determining the value of our ars as of december  we utilized a discounted cash flow valuation model with the major inputs to such model based on our estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing these instruments 
specifically  we used the following key inputs to our valuation model term we estimated a five year expected life of the instruments  based on our expectations of the most likely time in which it would take for the instruments to be called by the issuer or liquidity to be restored to the market place 
probability of default we determined the probability of default using market credit spreads 
discount rate we determined the discount rate based on estimated yields of similar publicly traded instruments eg  similar collateral  terms  credit quality  etc liquidity risk premium given the recent instability in the financial markets and the low demand for auction rate securities  it is unclear as to when these securities will become liquid again 
without the auction process functioning again  it would be extremely difficult to estimate the expected holding period for these instruments 
as a result  we included a to basis point premium to the discount rate to reflect the illiquidity of these bonds 
based on these key inputs  we estimated the fair value of our ars portfolio was million as of december  representing a million decrease in fair value since november  our ars securities and the related put option were the only investments as of december  in which we utilized level valuation techniques under sfas no 
on november   we recognized the ubs put as an asset measured at a fair value of million 
at december   the fair value of the ubs put was million 
we recorded a million gain in interest income during the fourth quarter of for the increase in the fair value of the ubs put since november  in determining the fair value of the ubs put as of december   we assumed we would redeem the auction rate securities at par at the earliest possible time  june  we utilized a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of the ubs put using the following assumptions a time period of years  representing the period from december  to the earliest date we can expect to be able to redeem the ubs put june  and a discount rate of  which included a spread based on the credit default swap of ubs in order to account for the credit risk of ubs 
we have elected fair value treatment for the ubs put under sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

the ubs put is the only instrument of its nature type that we hold and for which we have elected the fair value option under sfas no 
goodwill  intangible and long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important in the determination of an impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner that we use the acquired asset and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the associated risks 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
we determined that the worsening in our demand outlook experienced during the fourth quarter of was a significant event that indicated that the carrying amount of certain long lived and intangible asset groups might not be recoverable 
we conducted recoverability tests in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

as the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset groups exceeded their carrying amount  we determined that no impairment of our long lived assets had occurred at december  selected relationships within the consolidated statements of operations year ended december  percentage of net revenue net revenue products services total net revenue cost of revenues cost of products cost of services total cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses engineering and development selling and administrative acquired intangible assets amortization in process research and development restructuring and other  net goodwill impairment total operating expenses net interest and other loss income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes loss income from continuing operations results of operations discontinued operations on august   we completed the sale of the broadband test division to tollgrade for million in cash

bookings net bookings for our two reportable segments were as follows dollar change dollar change in millions semiconductor test systems test group the semiconductor test business is dependent on the current and anticipated market for test equipment  which historically has been highly cyclical 
semiconductor test bookings decreased million or from to due primarily to lower demand across all customer groups 
in  nextest contributed million of bookings and eagle test contributed million of bookings 
the semiconductor test bookings decreased million or from to due to lower demand across a wide range of end markets  applications and geographies  as soc device units grew at a lower rate in than in the lower demand in soc market was lessened by our increase in soc market share during  by approximately to points 
systems test group bookings increased million or from to  primarily due to an increase in mil aero board test program related bookings partially offset by decreases in commercial board test and diagnostic solutions 
systems test group bookings decreased million or from to  primarily due to decreases across all business units 
diagnostic solutions orders are program related and have significant fluctuations 
there was a large program rollout in for the vehicle measurement module product line 
mil aero bookings are also often program related  and there was also a significant military program that took place in commercial board test bookings decreased in due to a contraction in the size of the ict market 
order cancellations and backlog adjustments for our two reportable segments for the last three years were as follows in millions semiconductor test systems test group customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders suddenly and without significant notice  subject to possible cancellation penalties 
in  and  there were no significant cancellation penalties received 
due to possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of the actual sales for any succeeding period 
delays in delivery schedules and or cancellations of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

gross profit dollar point change dollar point change dollars in millions gross profit percent of total revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from to by percentage points 
a decrease of points was due to a million increase in provision for excess and obsolete inventory recorded as a result of the significant decrease in forecasted semiconductor demand coupled with a product transition  this decrease was partially offset by improved service margins in our semiconductor test group 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from to by percentage points 
a reduction in semiconductor test sales volume contributed to a decrease of points  a shift in product mix  primarily related to higher service revenue as a percentage of total revenue  contributed to a decrease of points  these decreases were partially offset by an increase of point related to lower semiconductor test inventory provision in  and an increase of point resulting from lower fixed costs and employee compensation across both segments 
the breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows dollar point change dollar point change dollars in millions product gross margin percent of product revenue service gross margin percent of service revenue we assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against on hand and on order inventory positions 
forecasted revenue information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future revenue demand 
this quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory 
obsolete inventory  which represents items for which there is no demand  is fully reserved 
excess inventory  which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed during the next four quarters  is written down to estimated net realizable value 
the provision for excess and obsolete inventory included in cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million

goodwill impairment in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 
we experienced a worsening in our demand outlook during the fourth quarter of this sharp decline is not expected to recover in the near term 
consequently  this has led to an impairment of our goodwill of million as of december  in process research and development in  we recorded an expense of million related to in process research and development related to the acquisition of nextest and eagle test 
on march   we purchased in process enabling test technology and hired certain engineers from mosaid technologies inc for million  which includes million in fees directly related to the acquisition 
of the purchase price  million has been allocated to in process research and development and therefore has been immediately charged to the statement of operations 
the balance of the purchase price has been allocated to acquired workforce and fixed assets 
in the year ended december   as a result of a workforce reduction  teradyne recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the acquired workforce asset

this was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable of million due to a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of and a decrease in days sales outstanding from days in to days in  as a result of improved collections 
this was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other accruals of million and an increase in other assets of million 
in  changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of product lines and businesses sold and acquired  used cash of million 
this was due to a number of factors including  an increase in accounts receivable of million due to an increase in days sales outstanding from days in to days in  a reduction of accrued income taxes of million due to the payments of foreign income taxes around the world  and an increase in other assets of million primarily related to balances due for inventory provided to our outsourced subcontract manufacturer of million

we made annual interest payments of million  paid semi annually  on the notes commencing on april  during and  we repurchased million of the outstanding notes pursuant to authorization from our board of directors 
the decision to repurchase a portion of the notes was based on the fair market value of the notes being below the return we would earn on high grade investment securities

we expect  based upon our current estimate of our revenue and operating results for fiscal year  that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of million will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
if our estimates of revenue and operating results for fiscal year significantly decrease  we could be required to obtain additional financing 
however  if financing is necessary  there can be no assurance that such capital will be available or that the terms will be acceptable to us 
inflation has not had a significant long term impact on earnings retirement plans we adopted the funded status recognition provision of sfas effective december  this standard amends sfas    and r 
sfas requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by sfas the pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plan s assets and the projected benefit obligation as of december for other postretirement benefit plans  the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december our pension expense  which includes the us qualified pension plan  certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries and a supplemental executive defined benefit plan  was approximately million for the year ended december  the largest portion of our pension expense was million for our supplemental executive defined benefit plan 
pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  a significant input to the actuarial models that measure pension benefit obligations 
two assumptions discount rate and expected return on assets are important elements of pension plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country specific basis 
we evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors  such as retirement age  mortality and turnover periodically  and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future 
in developing the expected return on plan assets assumption  we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants  including their review of asset class return expectations 
based on this review  we believe that was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal year we will continue to evaluate the expected return on plan assets at least annually  and will adjust the rate as necessary 
the current asset allocation for our us qualified pension plan is invested in equity securities and invested in fixed income securities 
our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our targeted allocations 
we base our determination of pension expense or benefit on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return on assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
as of december   under the us qualified pension plan  we had cumulative losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the us qualified pension plan is based on citigroup pension index adjusted for the plan s expected cash flows and was at december   down from at december  we estimate that in we will recognize approximately million of pension expense for the us qualified pension plan 
the pension expense estimate for is based on a discount rate  and return on plan assets 
future pension expense or benefit will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans 
as of december   we had unrecognized pension losses of million  of which million is for the us qualified pension plan 
we performed a sensitivity analysis  which expresses the estimated us qualified pension plan pension expense benefit that would have resulted for the year ended december   if we changed either the discount rate or the expected return on plan assets 
discount rate return on plan assets in millions the assets of the us qualified pension plan consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
the value of our us qualified pension plan assets has decreased from million at december  to million at december  our funding policy is to make contributions to the pension plan in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible 
during  there were no additional contributions made to the us qualified pension plan  and we made million of additional contributions to certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries 
based upon the non us qualified pension plan funded status as of december   we do not expect to make any contributions to this plan in contributions that will be made in to certain qualified plans for non us subsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and will be approximately million 
equity compensation plans in addition to our employee stock purchase plan discussed in note o stock based compensation in notes to consolidated financial statements  we have the equity and cash compensation incentive plan the equity plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents  marketable securities  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in us treasuries and government agencies 
all of our auction rate marketable securities are aaa  aa or a rated by one or more of the major credit rating agencies and are substantially guaranteed by a us department of education agency or a third party insurer 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management we regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our net monetary assets in the european euro  great britain pound  japanese yen and the taiwan dollar 
these foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of less than one year 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains on underlying exposures 
in addition  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized in the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of december    and  the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
our interest rate exposure is primarily in the united states in short term and long term marketable securities 
in order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk  a fluctuation in interest rates was assumed 
market risk for the short and long term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio 
on these bases  the potential change in fair value from changes in interest rates is million and million as of december  and  respectively
