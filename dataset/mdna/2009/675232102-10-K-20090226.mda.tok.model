certain statements in this annual report on form k  including  without limitation  statements regarding the following matters are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our business strategy  our plans for future operations  industry conditions  our expectations about earnings per share and segment operating results  and the factors underlying those expectations  including our expectations about demand for our deepwater oilfield services and products as a result of the factors we specify in the overview below  projections relating to subsea tree orders  the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources to support our operations and internally generated growth initiatives  our projected capital expenditures for  the adequacy of our accruals for uninsured expected liabilities from workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and general liability claims  our expectation that our total unrecognized tax benefits will not significantly increase or decrease in the next months  our expectations about the cash flows from our investment in medusa spar llc  and the factors underlying those expectations  our expectations regarding operating income for each of our segments and the factors underlying those expectations  our anticipated effective tax rate for  and our backlog 
these forward looking statements are subject to various risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including those we refer to under the headings risk factors and cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in part i of this report 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  because of the inherent limitations in the forecasting process  as well as the relatively volatile nature of the industries in which we operate  we can give no assurance that those expectations will prove to have been correct 
accordingly  evaluation of our future prospects must be made with caution when relying on forward looking information 
overview the table that follows sets out our revenue and profitability for  and year ended december  dollars in thousands revenue gross margin gross margin operating income operating income net income during  we generated approximately of our revenue  and of our operating income  from our services and products provided to the oil and gas industry 
in  we increased revenue by  led by our subsea products up and rov up segments 
our subsea products segment revenue increased from sales of oceaneering intervention engineering specialty subsea products and oceaneering multiflex umbilicals 
our rov segment increase was a result of an improvement in average revenue per day on hire and growth in days on hire for our expanded work class fleet 
the million consolidated net income we earned in was the highest in our history 
the million increase from net income was attributable to higher profit contributions from our rov  subsea products and inspection segments  with each setting annual profit records 
the rov and subsea products improvements reflected our strategic focus on deepwater and subsea page 
table of contents completion activity 
our inspection increase was due to additional  higher margin work on offshore production platforms  lng and petrochemical facilities and pipelines 
in  we invested in the following major capital projects additions of work class rovs  including placed into service during the year  expenditures to increase capabilities at our subsea products manufacturing facilities  and purchase of norway based gto subsea as gto  a rental provider of specialized subsea dredging and excavation equipment 
for  we expect the demand for many of our deepwater oilfield services and products will decrease  with the exception of our rov services 
we believe the general decline in demand will be driven by lower crude oil prices attributable to decreasing hydrocarbon demand from the ongoing global recession 
however  we expect our deepwater operations will be affected to a lower extent than the general decline in worldwide oil and gas activities  as we believe the trend for our customers to increasingly invest in deepwater projects will continue 
our belief is based on the length of time needed to plan and execute deepwater projects  and the long term outlook for oil and gas supply  which includes limited non opec supply growth  rapid reservoir depletion rates and eventually increasing hydrocarbon demand 
we expect our diluted earnings per share to be in the range of to  as compared to in  with an increase in operating income in our rov segment and decreases in our subsea projects and inspection segments 
we anticipate rov operating income to increase in as a result of a higher average fleet size 
we believe the results from our subsea products segment could be similar to those of the expected decline in demand for our subsea products should be substantially offset by improved efficiencies and project execution in our manufacturing operations 
however  further project delays by our customers would result in a decrease in subsea products operating income from that of we use our rovs in the offshore oil and gas industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks  including drill support  installation and construction support  pipeline inspection and surveys and subsea production facility inspection  repair and maintenance 
the largest percentage of our rovs is usually used to provide drill support services 
therefore  utilization of floating drilling rigs is a leading market indicator for this business 
the following table shows average floating rig use and our rov utilization 
average number of floating rigs in use rov days on hire in thousands rov utilization according to industry data published by ods petrodata  at the end of there were floating drilling rigs in the world 
ninety eight additional floating rigs were on order and scheduled to be delivered through  and of these have been contracted long term  for an average term of over six years 
demand for floating rigs is our primary driver of future growth prospects  on a concurrent or delayed basis 
according to industry data published by quest offshore resources  inc  there were less than subsea completions before and approximately  in the decade of the s 
quest is currently forecasting that there will be approximately  subsea completion installations in the decade of the s and over  in the decade of the s 
according to quest  the projected global market for subsea tree orders is expected to increase more than in the time period compared to the previous five years 
in addition to floating rig demand  subsea tree orders are another leading indicator of the strength of the deepwater market and the primary demand driver for our subsea products lines 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these principles require us to make various estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the periods we present 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  however  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion summarizes the accounting policies we believe require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are the most critical to our reporting of results of operations and financial position

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize our revenue according to the type of contract involved 
on a daily basis  we recognize revenue under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 
we recognize our revenue according to the type of contract involved 
on a daily basis  we recognize revenue under contracts that provide for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill periodically  ranging from weekly to monthly 
we account for significant fixed price contracts  which we enter into mainly in our subsea products segment  and occasionally in our subsea projects and advanced technologies segments  using the percentage of completion method 
in  we accounted for of our revenue using the percentage of completion method 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we consider whether the customer provides specifications for the construction of facilities or production of goods or for the provision of related services  we can reasonably estimate our progress towards completion and our costs  the contract includes provisions as to the enforceable rights regarding the goods or services to be provided  consideration to be received and the manner and terms of payment  the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  and we can be expected to perform our contractual obligations 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings immediately 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when we determine it 
in prior years  we have recorded adjustments to earnings as a result of revisions to contract estimates 
although we are continually striving to improve our ability to estimate our contract costs and profitability  adjustments to overall contract costs could be significant in future periods 
we recognize the remainder of our revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be appropriate 
we base these evaluations on a comparison of the assets carrying values to forecasts of undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets or quoted market prices 
if an impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
our expectations regarding future sales and undiscounted cash flows are highly subjective  cover extended periods of time and depend on a number of factors outside our control  such as changes in general economic conditions  laws and regulations 
accordingly  these expectations could differ significantly from year to year 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce our investment in the ocean pensador  an oil tanker we are holding for possible conversion  to its fair value 
we charge the costs of repair and maintenance of property and equipment to operations as incurred  while we capitalize the costs of improvements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this fasb staff position prohibits companies from recognizing planned major maintenance costs by accruing a liability over several reporting periods before the maintenance is performed the accrue in advance method 
we previously used the accrue in advance method for anticipated drydocking of our vessels 
this fasb staff position was effective for us beginning january   and we have since charged drydocking expenses to the income statement as incurred 
there was no material effect on our financial statements from the change 
goodwill 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  with the purchase price being allocated to the net assets acquired based on their fair market values at the date of acquisition 
in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test the goodwill attributable to each of our reporting units for impairment 
except for inspection  which is tested as a single reporting unit  our operating units are one level below our business segments 
we estimate fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flow methodologies and market comparable information 
changes in estimate of our future cash flows may result in goodwill impairments in the future 
loss contingencies 
we self insure for workers compensation  maritime employer s liability and comprehensive general liability claims to levels we consider financially prudent and carry insurance for exposures beyond the self insurance levels  which can be by page 
table of contents occurrence or in the aggregate 
we determine the level of accruals by reviewing our historical experience and current year claim activity 
we do not record accruals on a present value basis 
we review larger claims with insurance adjusters and establish specific reserves for known liabilities 
we establish an additional reserve for incidents incurred but not reported to us for each year using our estimates and based on prior experience 
we believe we have established adequate accruals for uninsured expected liabilities arising from those obligations 
however  it is possible that future earnings could be affected by changes in our estimates relating to these matters 
we are involved in various claims and actions against us  most of which are covered by insurance 
we believe that our ultimate liability  if any  that may result from these claims and actions will not materially affect our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
income taxes 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies the criteria for recognizing income tax benefits under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 and requires disclosures about uncertain tax positions 
under fin  the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position depends on the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we made an adjustment of million to reduce our retained earnings as of january  to record the effect of our adoption of this interpretation 
we account for any applicable interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes on our financial statements 
we charged million to income tax expense in for penalties and interest for uncertain tax positions  which brought our total liabilities for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions to million on our balance sheet at december  including associated foreign tax credits and penalties and interest  we have accrued a net total of million in the caption other long term liabilities on our balance sheet for unrecognized tax benefits 
all additions or reductions to those liabilities affect our effective income tax rate in the periods of change 
we do not believe that the total of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the next months 
our tax provisions are based on our expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws 
we are at risk that a taxing authority s final determination of our tax liabilities may differ from our interpretation 
our effective tax rate may fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions  the amount of pre tax income fluctuates and our estimates regarding the realizability of items such as foreign tax credits may change 
in  and  we recorded reductions of income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  resulting from the resolution of uncertain tax positions related to certain tax liabilities we recorded in prior years 
current income tax expense represents either nonresident withholding taxes or the liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  while the net deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on our balance sheet 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
we currently have no valuation allowances 
while we have considered estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowances  changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
these adjustments to the valuation allowance would impact our income tax provision in the period in which such adjustments are identified and recorded

the maturities include million due under our one year term loan agreement 
maturities in are not classified as current as of december   since we are able and have the intent to extend the stated maturities by borrowing amounts equal to the maturities under the revolving credit facility  with a maturity date after one year

our facility expansions in the united kingdom  norway and houston during related to our subsea products manufacturing operations  and our morgan city expansion supports our rov and subsea projects operations 
our capital expenditures during included million in our rov segment  principally for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet to expand the fleet and replace units we retired and for facilities infrastructure 
in  we commenced improvements in our subsea products facilities  including the addition of equipment to increase manufacturing capacity at our umbilical plant in the uk and our subsea valve facility in norway and purchased an oil tanker for possible future conversion to a mobile offshore production and storage system in the event we obtain a suitable contract 
we also began upgrades to a dynamically positioned vessel and began construction of a saturation diving system to meet demand in our subsea projects segment 
our capital expenditures during and included million and million  respectively  in our rov segment  principally for additions and upgrades to our rov fleet to expand the fleet and replace units we retired and for facilities infrastructure to support our growing rov fleet size 
we plan to continue adding rovs at levels we determine appropriate to meet market opportunities as they arise 
we added and rovs to our fleet and disposed of four and seven units during and  respectively  resulting in a total of systems in the fleet at december  in  we chartered a larger deepwater vessel  the ocean intervention iii  for three years  with extension options for up to six additional years 
the initial three year term of the charter began in may we also chartered an additional larger deepwater vessel  the olympic intervention iv  for an initial term of five years  which began in the third quarter of we outfitted each of these larger deepwater vessels with two of our high specification work class rovs  and we expect to utilize these vessels to perform subsea hardware installation and inspection  repair and maintenance projects  and to conduct well intervention services in the ultra deep waters of the gulf of mexico 
we have not guaranteed any debt not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
in december  we acquired a interest in medusa spar llc 
at formation  medusa spar llc borrowed million  or approximately of its total capitalization  from a group of banks

the increases in accounts receivable were due to increases in revenue in the fourth quarter of the respective year as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year 
at december   we also had additional receivables related to our subsea projects diving and vessel activity  including our work from the performer  which we mobilized to angola in the third quarter of the initial customer payments on the performer s contract in angola were delayed beyond december   but have subsequently been made 
the increases in inventory and other current assets principally related to rov requirements and subsea products raw materials 
the raw materials increases in and related to preparations for building goods in our subsea products segment  which experienced revenue increases of and in and  respectively

in addition to having a full year of service from the units we added during  we expect to add approximately to rovs in our subsea products revenue for and rose and over the respective prior year on increased sales of our specialty subsea products and umbilicals 
in  our operating margin percentage decreased from to due to higher costs of engineering and manufacturing on our first two blowout preventer bop control systems and slightly lower margins on several of our other specialty product lines 
in  our operating margin increased from to as a result of better design and pricing and improved manufacturing execution  including better throughput and resolution during of startup problems at our us umbilical plant 
we anticipate our subsea products segment operating income in could be similar to  with an anticipated decline in demand for our products offset by expected improvements in execution performance in our manufacturing operations 
however  further project delays by our customers would result in a decrease in subsea products operating income from that of our subsea products backlog was million at december  compared to million at december  our subsea projects operating income declined million from on relatively flat revenue due to a softer market for our diving and shallow water vessel services  principally as a result of the substantial completion of work associated with damage caused by hurricanes in and  costs incurred to mobilize the olympic intervention iv to the gulf of mexico and complete its preparation for service  and expenses we incurred associated with regulatory inspection of four of our vessels 
the amount included a million gain from the sale of an rov support vessel 
the revenue shortage from the factors mentioned above was partially offset by additional revenue from a full year of availability from the ocean intervention iii and the fourth quarter utilization of the olympic intervention iv 
in  our subsea projects segment experienced higher revenue and operating income than from an increase in hurricane damage related projects 
our operating income rose by over on an increase in revenue of 
we continued to experience favorable pricing for and utilization of our vessel and diving assets 
additionally  during the year we added a saturation diving system  placed the performer back into service after its upgrade  and chartered and utilized two dynamically positioned vessels and a barge 
our margin percentages decreased due to the high third party cost content of the chartered assets 
we anticipate our operating income for subsea projects to be less than in  as we foresee a continuation of declining demand for our shallow water services and competitive pressure in our deepwater vessel market  due to an increase in industry vessel availability 
in and  our inspection revenue and margins continued to increase  due to strong growth in all of the geographic areas we serve 
we continued to sell more value added services at improved pricing 
we expect that our inspection segment operating income will decrease in  due to a lower exchange rate for the uk pound sterling against the us dollar and decreased demand for our services 
our mobile offshore production systems two operating units continued to work under the same contracts 
the decreases in margins in were the result of a million impairment charge to reduce our investment in the ocean pensador  an oil tanker we are holding for possible conversion  to its fair value and the decline in the dayrate of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract 
the decreases in margins in were the result of million of expenses incurred to move the ocean pensador from the us west coast to southeast asia in the fourth quarter of  and the decline in the dayrate of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract 
we moved the ocean pensador to better position it in the marketplace 
the vessel is now closer to several shipyards capable of modifying it for production or storage service  either for us or another owner should we sell it 
we anticipate our mobile offshore production systems operating income in will decline from as a result of a lower dayrate going into effect in mid may for the use of the ocean legend  as per the customer renewal option terms in the existing contract  and the anticipated end of the current contract on the ocean producer in early page

effects of inflation and changing prices our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  using historical us dollar accounting  or historical cost 
statements based on historical cost  however  do not adequately reflect the cumulative effect of increasing costs and changes in the purchasing power of the dollar  especially during times of significant and continued inflation 
in order to minimize the negative impact of inflation on our operations  we attempt to cover the increased cost of anticipated changes in labor  material and service costs  either through an estimate of those changes  which we reflect in the original price  or through price escalation clauses in our contracts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks relate to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not believe these risks are material 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we manage our exposure to interest rate changes through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our long term debt agreements  interest rates and maturities 
we believe significant interest rate changes would not have a material near term impact on our future earnings or cash flows 
we have interest rate hedges in place on million of floating rate debt under our revolving credit facility for the period august to august the hedges fix three month libor at until august and at for the period august to august because we operate in various oil and gas exploration and production regions in the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for several of our international operations is the applicable local currency 
a stronger us dollar against the us pound sterling and the norwegian kroner would result in lower operating income in our inspection and rov segments 
we manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally through arranging compensation in us dollars or freely convertible currency and  to the extent possible  by limiting compensation received in other currencies to amounts necessary to meet obligations denominated in those currencies 
we use the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date to translate assets and liabilities as to which the functional currency is the local currency  resulting in translation adjustments that we reflect as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we recorded adjustments of million  million and million to our equity accounts in  and  respectively 
negative adjustments reflect the net impact of the strengthening of the us dollar against various foreign currencies for locations where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
conversely  positive adjustments reflect the effect of a weakening dollar 
we recorded foreign currency transaction gains losses of million  million and million in our consolidated income statements in  and  respectively  related to our foreign operations 
in  the majority of our foreign currency losses related to our uk operations 
some of our uk subsidiary s revenue is from us dollar denominated contracts  if the us dollar weakens against the british pound sterling  we will incur currency losses for the period the related accounts receivable are outstanding
