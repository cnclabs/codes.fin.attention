table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part iv  item of this report  the risk factors included in part i  item a of this report  and the cautionary statements included throughout this report 
the inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make appropriate estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present  in all material respects  our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole 
as of february   we operated upscale  full service casual dining restaurants  under the cheesecake factory mark  under the grand lux cafe mark  one unit of our newest concept  rocksugar pan asian kitchen and two bakery production facilities 
we also licensed two limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory bakery cafe mark to another foodservice operator 
we closed our self service  limited menu express foodservice operation under the cheesecake factory express mark upon expiration of our license agreement during fiscal the cheesecake factory is an upscale casual dining concept that offers approximately menu items including appetizers  pizza  seafood  steaks  chicken  burgers  pasta  specialty items  salads  sandwiches  omelets and desserts  including approximately varieties of cheesecake and other baked desserts 
grand lux cafe and rocksugar pan asian kitchen are also upscale casual dining concepts offering approximately menu items and approximately menu items  respectively 
in contrast to many chain restaurant operations  substantially all of our menu items except desserts manufactured at our bakery production facilities are prepared on the restaurant premises using high quality  fresh ingredients based on innovative and proprietary recipes 
we believe our restaurants are recognized by consumers for offering value with generous food portions at moderate prices 
our restaurants distinctive  contemporary design and decor create a high energy ambiance in a casual setting 
our restaurants currently range in size from  to  interior square feet  provide full liquor service and are generally open seven days a week for lunch and dinner  as well as sunday brunch 
total restaurant sales represented approximately  and of our revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  with bakery sales accounting for the remainder 
overview in addition to being highly competitive  the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns  changes in general economic conditions  public safety conditions  demographic trends  weather conditions  the cost and availability of raw materials  labor and energy  purchasing power  and government regulations 
accordingly  as part of our strategy we must constantly evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to protect our competitiveness and to maintain and enhance the strength of our brand 
our strategy is driven by our commitment to guest satisfaction and focused primarily on operational execution and menu innovation to drive competitively strong and sustainable financial performance 
we strive to improve productivity and efficiency through the selection  training and retention of high quality  service oriented employees  as well as through the use of technology 
our menu is one of the broadest in casual dining  and we believe we provide value through an extensive menu of freshly prepared  high quality and large portion menu items at moderate prices 
our menu is a strong platform for us to continue to innovate in order to remain relevant to our guests 
financially  we are focused on a prudent allocation of capital to drive profitability and returns 
in evaluating and assessing the performance of our business  we believe the following are key performance indicators that should be taken into consideration comparable restaurant sales and overall revenue growth 
increases in comparable restaurant sales will come from a higher check average as a result of menu price increases or changes in mix  as well 
table of contents as from gains in guest traffic 
comparable restaurant sales growth  in addition to revenue from new restaurant openings and increases in third party bakery sales  will contribute to overall revenue growth at existing restaurants and increased bakery sales 
income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenues operating margins 
operating margins are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs  labor  restaurant level occupancy expenses and preopening expenses 
our objective is to gradually increase our operating margins by capturing economies of scale and fixed cost leverage from same restaurant sales increases  utilizing technology to reduce costs and maximizing our purchasing power as our business grows 
in addition  by efficiently scaling our restaurant and bakery support infrastructure  we should be able to grow general and administrative expenses at a slower rate than revenue growth over the long term  which will also contribute to operating margin expansion 
return on investment 
return on investment measures our ability to make the best decisions about how we allocate our capital 
returns are affected by the cost to build restaurants  the level of revenues that each restaurant can deliver and our ability to maximize the profitability of restaurants through strict cost management 
our objective is to deploy capital in a manner that will maximize our returns 
although we slowed the pace of new restaurant development in fiscal to maintain our capital flexibility  we plan to continue developing the cheesecake factory and grand lux cafe in high quality  high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets 
we apply a disciplined approach to site selection  choosing only premier sites that we believe can deliver the highest margins 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of operations expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses impairment of assets preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest expense interest income other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior fiscal year 
the resulting sales increase of million consisted of million  or a decrease in comparable restaurant sales and a million increase from locations that were not in the comparable sales base 
at december   there were restaurants not included in the comparable sales base 
new restaurants become eligible to enter our comparable sales calculations in their th month of operation 
comparable sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants decreased approximately from fiscal we implemented an approximate effective menu price increase during our winter menu update in the first quarter of  and an additional approximate effective menu price increase during our summer menu update in the third quarter of on a weighted basis  we estimate that we had an approximate effective menu price increase during fiscal the decrease in comparable sales for fiscal was due to reduced traffic at our restaurants caused primarily by the macro economic factors affecting the restaurant industry in general 
comparable sales at our grand lux cafes decreased approximately from fiscal year we implemented an effective menu price increase of approximate in april we believe this decrease in comparable sales is also attributable to a decrease in guest traffic caused by the macro economic factors impacting the restaurant industry in general 
we generally update and reprint the menus in our restaurants twice a year 
for cheesecake factory restaurants  these updates generally occur during the first quarter the winter menu change and during the third quarter the summer menu change 
as part of these menu updates  we evaluate the need for menu price increases based on those operating cost and expense increases that we are aware of or can reasonably expect 
while menu price increases can facilitate increased comparable restaurant sales in addition to offsetting margin pressure  all potential menu price increases must be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as general economic conditions  inclement weather  timing of holidays  and competitive and other factors  including those referenced in part i  item a of this report can impact comparable sales comparisons 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that increases in comparable sales will be achieved 
for our winter menu change  we are implementing a targeted effective menu price increase 
we plan to review our operating cost and expense trends in the spring of and consider the need for additional menu pricing in connection with our summer menu change 
total restaurant operating weeks increased to  compared to  in fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week decreased in fiscal to  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in average weekly sales is due principally to a decline in guest traffic 
in fiscal  we have opened one cheesecake factory restaurant to date and may open as many as two additional cheesecake factory restaurants during the remainder of the year 
we do not plan to open any grand lux cafe or rocksugar pan asian kitchen restaurants during fiscal bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to higher sales to the warehouse clubs  which is our largest sales channel for bakery sales 
warehouse clubs accounted for approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to in fiscal we strive to develop and maintain long term  growing relationships with our bakery customers  based largely on our year reputation for producing high quality  creative baked desserts 
however  bakery sales volumes always will be less predictable than our restaurant sales 
it is difficult to predict the timing of bakery product shipments and contribution margins on a quarterly basis  as the purchasing plans of our large account customers may fluctuate 
due to the highly competitive nature of the bakery business  we are unable to enter into long term contracts with our large account bakery customers  who may discontinue purchasing our products without advance notice at any time for any reason 

table of contents cost of sales cost of sales consists of food  beverage  retail and bakery production supply costs incurred in conjunction with our restaurant and bakery revenues  and excludes depreciation  which is captured separately in depreciation and amortization expenses 
cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these costs increased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily attributable to unfavorable year over year pricing for cheese and general grocery items 
the menus at our restaurants are among the most diversified in the foodservice industry and accordingly  are not overly dependent on a single commodity 
changes in costs for one commodity are often  but not always  counterbalanced by cost changes in other commodity categories 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other fresh dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
we are currently able to contract for the majority of the food commodities used in our operations for periods of up to one year 
with the exception of cream cheese used in our bakery operations  some of our commodities  such as fish  dairy  and certain produce products are not currently contractible for periods longer than days in most cases 
as a result  these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due principally to weather and other agricultural conditions 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products  with an expected requirement of as much as million to million pounds during fiscal we have contracted for a majority of our fiscal cream cheese requirements and will also purchase cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our agreements 
as has been our past practice  we will carefully consider opportunities to introduce new menu items and implement selected menu price increases to help offset expected cost increases for key commodities and other goods and services utilized by our operations 
while we have been successful in the past in reacting to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  more efficient purchasing practices  improving productivity and leveraging greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for these commodities will not fluctuate due to weather  fuel costs and other market conditions outside of our control 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher during the first to days of operations until they normalize as our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to better predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes at the new restaurant 
labor expenses labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor  including associated fringe benefits  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally to support the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal while we manage our labor judiciously to adapt to revenue fluctuations  we expect to experience de leveraging of labor costs at lower sales levels as we are committed to delivering the level of service our guests have come to expect  while still achieving reasonable labor costs 
in addition  during fiscal  we experienced minimum wage increases in several states in which we operate and increased health insurance costs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation to million  or of revenues  in fiscal from million  or of revenues  in fiscal for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher during the first to days of operations until they normalize as our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to better predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes at the new restaurant 
labor expenses can be subject to unforeseen increases for reasons beyond our control such as government mandated increases in minimum wages and tip credit 
table of contents levels  paid or unpaid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits  or increased tax reporting  assessment or payment requirements 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  insurance  licenses  taxes  and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in restaurant operating weeks due to new restaurants openings 
as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this increase was primarily due to de leveraging of fixed costs due to lower average weekly sales at our restaurants and higher utility rates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  as well as the restaurant field supervision  bakery administrative and corporate support and marketing organizations 
g a expenses decreased slightly to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal tighter management of our support infrastructure and lower stock based compensation expense were partially offset by our investment in marketing efforts and higher gift card related costs 
in fiscal  g a expenses included stock based compensation expense of million  or of revenues  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to purchases of property and equipment associated with new restaurant openings in fiscal and as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase is primarily due to de leveraging from lower average weekly sales at our restaurants 
impairment of assets during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge against the carrying value of three the cheesecake factory locations 
we did not incur impairment charges during either fiscal or fiscal preopening costs preopening costs decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we incurred preopening costs for six cheesecake factory restaurants and our first rocksugar pan asian kitchen restaurant during fiscal compared to cheesecake factory and five grand lux cafe openings in fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress 
preopening costs include incremental out of pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants and are not otherwise capitalizable 
as a result of the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale  high volume concepts  the preopening process for our restaurants is more extensive  time consuming and costly relative to that of most chain restaurant operations 
preopening costs vary by location depending on a number of factors  including the proximity of our existing restaurants  the size and physical layout of each location  the number of management and hourly employees required to operate each restaurant  the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing process  the cost of travel and lodging for different metropolitan areas  and the timing of the restaurant opening 
in addition  preopening costs are impacted by the extent of unexpected delays  if any  in obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurants  which may also be dependent on our landlords obtaining their licenses and permits  as well as completing their construction activities  for the properties that our leased premises are located within 

table of contents preopening costs for a typical single story cheesecake factory restaurant in an established market averages approximately million to million and includes costs to relocate and compensate an average of to restaurant management employees prior to opening  costs to recruit and train an average of hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  costs for practice food service activities  and straight line minimum base rent during the build out and in restaurant training periods 
also included in preopening costs are expenses allocated to each restaurant opening  which may potentially include costs for maintaining a roster of trained managers for pending openings  as well as corporate travel and support activities 
preopening costs are usually higher for larger restaurants  initial entry into a new market or for newer concepts 
in any of these situations  we could experience preopening costs of approximately million to million per restaurant 
we usually incur the most significant portion of preopening costs within the two month period immediately preceding and the month of a restaurant s opening 
preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant 
interest expense  interest income and other income interest expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to higher borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
interest expense also included million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to lower investment balances driven by significant share repurchases in both years  partially offset by reduced capital spending for restaurant openings 
we recorded net other expense of million for fiscal compared to net other income of million for the prior year 
this million variance primarily relates to declines in value of our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our obligations under the cheesecake factory incorporated executive savings plan esp  a non qualified deferred compensation plan 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease from the prior year was primarily attributable to higher tax credits and other employment incentives and a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the approval by the internal revenue service of our change in method of accounting for construction allowances 
the favorable rate impact of these items was partially offset by our reserve for the potential disallowance of certain executive compensation under the provisions of internal revenue code section m and by non deductible losses in our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our esp 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior fiscal year 
the resulting sales increase of million consisted of million  or a  increase in comparable restaurant sales and million increase from restaurants not in the comparable sales base 
by concept  comparable restaurant sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants increased approximately and comparable sales at the grand lux cafes increased approximately 
sales in comparable cheesecake factory restaurants benefited from a weighted effective menu price increase of during fiscal  partially offset by reduced traffic at our restaurants  due primarily to the macro economic factors affecting the restaurant industry in general 
sales in comparable grand lux cafes benefited from an approximate effective menu price increase implemented in october and an approximate menu price increase implemented in april 
table of contents total restaurant operating weeks increased to  compared to  for fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week decreased approximately in fiscal to  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in average weekly sales was due principally to increased openings of grand lux cafes  which we had expected to open with average sales per week lower than the existing grand lux cafe base  and decreased restaurant traffic 
bakery sales decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower sales to our warehouse clubs  which accounted for approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal  partially offset by increased sales of the dream factory and private label products in other distribution channels 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to favorable year over year pricing for produce  seafood and general grocery items 
these benefits were partially offset by cost pressures in dairy commodities 
labor expenses labor expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally in support of the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased minimum wages in several states which we operate as well as increased health insurance cost for our staff members

fiscal outlook this discussion contains forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part iv  item of this report  the risk factors included in part i  item a of this report  and the cautionary statements included throughout this report 
the inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make appropriate estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present  in all material respects  our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole 
in fiscal  we plan to open as many as three new locations  consisting solely of the cheesecake factory restaurants 
we anticipate diluted earnings per share for fiscal will be between and  assuming  among other things  that comparable restaurant sales are in a range of between and 
we expect cash capital expenditures in fiscal to range between million and million  of which approximately million to million will be used to fund as many as three new restaurant openings 
we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately million to million in fiscal and plan to utilize our free cash flow as well as a portion of our existing cash on hand to reduce approximately million to million of the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
liquidity and capital resources one of our corporate financial objectives is to maintain a sufficiently strong and conservative balance sheet to support our operating initiatives and unit growth with financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and bakery brands  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations in the current economic environment 
our ongoing capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plan and ongoing maintenance of our restaurants and bakery facilities  as well as investment in our corporate and information technology 
table of contents infrastructures 
in fiscal  we also intend to utilize capital to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
similar to many restaurant and retail chain store operations  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while most of our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet  the minimum base rents and related fixed obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
historically  we have obtained capital from our ongoing operations  public stock offerings  debt financing  employee stock option exercises and construction contributions from our landlords 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale  and we are able to sell many of our food inventory items before payment is due to the suppliers of such items 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements dollar amounts in millions december  january  january  cash and marketable securities on hand net working capital adjusted net working capital current ratio adjusted current ratio long term debt and deemed landlord financing liability  including current portion adjusted to include marketable securities classified as noncurrent assets million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
landlord construction allowances related to restaurant locations for which we are deemed  for accounting purposes only  to have an ownership interest are reflected in our balance sheets as deemed landlord financing 
this liability is amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
fiscal year cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures borrowings on credit facility purchase of treasury stock in the table above  we present adjusted net working capital and current ratio calculations that include all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
we believe these adjusted calculations provide investors with useful information regarding our overall liquidity position because all marketable securities are readily available to meet our liquidity requirements 
during fiscal  our total amount of cash and marketable securities on hand increased by million to million at december  this increase was principally due to cash provided by operating activities  borrowing on our credit facility and landlord construction contributions  partially offset by purchases of treasury stock and property and equipment 
at december   we had million of cash invested in a tax exempt money market fund  of which million was insured by the us treasury temporary guarantee program 
see 
table of contents note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of cash and cash equivalents 
our restaurant development model more closely resembles that of a retail business that occupies leased space in shopping malls  lifestyle centers  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers and other real estate developments 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary by lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on net sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example  our prorata share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out our leased premises 
we may also disburse cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in the respective leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
we do not have any current plans to encumber our existing leasehold interests with lessee secured financing 
we own substantially all of the ff e in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
capital expenditures were relatively lower in fiscal compared to fiscal and due to the number of restaurants opened in each year seven  and  respectively 
capital expenditures for new restaurants  including locations under development as of each fiscal year end were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  approximately million of new restaurant capital expenditures were funded through deemed landlord financing 
of the remaining fiscal capital expenditures  million represented maintenance and capacity addition outlays for our existing restaurants  and approximately million was for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our cash outlays for capital expenditures to range between million and million  net of agreed upon up front cash landlord construction contributions and excluding million to million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
this amount also excludes approximately million of landlord construction contributions to be applied as reductions to minimum or percentage rent over the lease terms 
the amount reflected as additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows may vary from this estimate based on the accounting treatment of each operating lease see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report 
this estimate contemplates a net outlay of million to million for as many as three restaurants to be opened during fiscal  estimated construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings and estimated collections of up front cash landlord construction contributions 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include approximately million to million for maintenance and capacity addition expenditures to our existing restaurants and million to million for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
on april   we entered into a five year revolving credit facility facility with a maximum available borrowing commitment of million 
on march   we amended the facility to increase the maximum available borrowing commitment to million and simultaneously borrowed an additional million  primarily to fund share repurchases 
on january   we entered into a second amendment  which reset our minimum financial covenants and pricing  and also limits cash distributions with respect to our equity interests  such as cash dividends and share repurchases  based on a liquidity threshold 
borrowings under the amended facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the london interbank offering rate libor plus a spread ranging from to  depending on our ratio of debt to trailing month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and noncash stock option expense ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee ranging from to  also depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda  calculated on the average unused portion of the facility 
the amended facility restricts unsecured borrowings to million and includes a pledge of our outstanding equity interests in the cheesecake factory bakery incorporated and the cheesecake factory assets co 
llc  which had carrying values of million and million  respectively  at december  we are obligated to maintain certain financial covenants  which include a maximum debt to ebitda ratio of to as of the fiscal quarter ending march  and to as of the end of any fiscal quarter thereafter  as well as a minimum ebitdar ebitda plus rental expense  as defined in the facility  to interest and 
table of contents rental expense ratio of to as of any of the fiscal quarters ending march  through september  and to as of the end of any fiscal quarter thereafter 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants in effect under the facility at that date 
the outstanding borrowings under this facility were used to support share repurchases in both fiscal and availability under the facility is reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit  which are used to support our self insurance programs 
as of december   we had net availability for borrowings of million  based on outstanding debt of million and million in standby letters of credit 
since we have the contractual ability to maintain the outstanding balance on our facility  the debt is classified as long term on our consolidated balance sheets 
during fiscal and  we entered into three zero cost interest rate collars to hedge interest rate variability on million of outstanding borrowings on our facility 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments 
our board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization of our common shares by million shares during fiscal and by million shares in fiscal  for a total authorization of million shares 
under this authorization  we cumulatively repurchased a total of million shares for a total cost of million through december  the authorization does not have an expiration date  does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time 
the timing and number of shares repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase authorization are subject to a number of factors  including current market conditions  legal constraints  financial covenants under our credit facility  and available cash or other sources of funding 
shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
our share repurchase plan has been used to return excess capital to shareholders when new restaurant site availability does not meet our criteria  as well as to minimize the dilutive impact of our stock option programs 
in august  we entered into a b plan 
in october  we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in order to maintain maximum flexibility in our capital decisions in light of the unprecedented crisis in the global financial markets and the indeterminate future impact it could have on the overall economy and on our business 
concurrently with the effective date of such suspension  we terminated our b plan 
based on our current expansion objectives  we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  combined with expected cash flows provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through we may seek additional funds to finance our growth in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
as of february   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions

depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets or the primary lease terms of the respective leases plus any exercised extensions of those lease terms  whichever is shorter 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgment by management  which may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than if different assumptions were used 
impairment of long lived assets we assess potential impairments of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the recoverability is assessed in most cases by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
restaurants falling below a defined threshold of projected cash flows to carrying value are regularly monitored 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed their fair values 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment based on our experience and knowledge 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in the economic environment  real estate market conditions and capital spending decisions 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge against the carrying value of three the cheesecake factory locations 
we did not incur impairment charges during either fiscal or fiscal if the current economic situation deepens in magnitude and or we are unable to implement initiatives to appropriately 
table of contents scale our infrastructure in a timely manner  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
leases we currently lease all of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
minimum base rent for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the initial rent term includes the build out  or rent holiday period  for our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
contingent rent expense  which is based on a percentage of revenue  is also recorded to the extent it exceeds minimum base rent per the lease agreement 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and ff e to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
depending on the specifics of the leased space  the lease agreement and in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  the amounts paid for structural components will be recorded during the construction period as either prepaid rent or construction in progress and the landlord construction contributions will be recorded as either an offset to prepaid rent or as a deemed landlord financing liability 
upon completion of construction for those leases that meet the criteria of eitf  the lease may qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
for these leases  the deemed landlord financing liability and the associated construction in progress will be removed and the difference will be reclassified to prepaid or deferred rent and amortized over the lease term as an increase or decrease to rent expense 
if the lease does not qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 the deemed landlord financing liability will be amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
self insurance liability we retain the financial responsibility for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  employment practices  employee health benefits and other insurable risks 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgment regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  case jurisdiction  applicable legislation and our claims settlement practices 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our individual claim exposure for many of our programs and for aggregate exposure on our employee health benefits program 
the estimated amounts receivable from our third party insurers under this coverage are recorded in other receivables 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr amounts as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
stock based compensation we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of stock option grants  which requires the use of subjective assumptions  including the volatility of our common stock price and the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options prior to exercise 
additionally  we estimate the expected forfeiture rate related to both stock options and restricted stock in determining the amount of stock based compensation expense for each period 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect our results of operations 
see note 
table of contents of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time we prepare our income tax provision 
in making our estimates  we also consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we update our estimates  which  in turn  may result in adjustments to our effective tax rate 
we generally file our income tax returns within nine to ten months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we account for uncertain tax positions under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  and accordingly review these positions on a quarterly basis 
assessment of uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments relating to the amounts  timing and likelihood of ultimate resolution 
our actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   except for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis  for which application was deferred for one year 
as discussed in note  we adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal adoption of the deferred provisions in the first quarter of fiscal will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued statement no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities and is effective for us as of the first quarter of fiscal the implementation of this statement will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and requires enhanced related disclosures 
fsp must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets acquired subsequent to fiscal years beginning after december  implementation of this staff position in the first quarter of fiscal will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant and bakery customers 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for some of our commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations for periods longer than days 
consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
dairy 
table of contents costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant and bakery operations 
many of our restaurant and bakery staff members are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage 
in fiscal  congress enacted an increase in the federal minimum wage implemented in two phases  beginning in fiscal and concluding in fiscal in addition  numerous state and local governments increased the minimum wage within their jurisdictions  with further state minimum wage increases going into effect in fiscal certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  macro economic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues and net income for our established restaurants have occurred in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
approximately two thirds of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available productive seating for all restaurants open as of december  and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
holidays  severe weather  hurricanes  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
we are exposed to market risk from interest rate changes on funded debt 
this exposure relates to the component of the interest rate on our million revolving credit facility facility that is indexed to three month libor 
at december   we had million in debt outstanding under the facility 
during fiscal and  we entered into three zero cost interest rate collars to hedge interest rate variability on million of outstanding borrowings on our facility 
since a majority of our funded debt is hedged  a hypothetical interest rate increase would only have a million impact on our pretax results of operations 
by using derivative instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates  we are exposed to the potential failure of our counterparties to perform under the terms of the agreements 
we minimize this credit risk by contracting only with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt and derivative financial instruments  respectively 

table of contents a change in market prices also exposes us to market risk related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of december  and january   we held million and million in available for sale marketable securities  respectively 
a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in million and million of unrealized losses and a corresponding decline in their fair values at december  and january   respectively 
we are also subject to market risk related to our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our esp  to the extent these investments are not equivalent to the related liability 
in addition  because changes in these investments are not subject to tax  the full impact of gains or losses affects net income 
based on balances at december   a hypothetical decline in the market value of our deferred compensation assets and related liabilities would decrease income from operations by million and net income by million 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based on market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
however  we are currently unable to contract for some of our commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations for periods longer than days 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
in addition  we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
