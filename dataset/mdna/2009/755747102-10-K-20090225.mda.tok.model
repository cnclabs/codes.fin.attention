item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
historical results and percentage relationships among accounts are not necessarily an indication of trends in operating results for any future period 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
executive overview our revenue is directly related to the level of construction activity in our markets 
ordinarily  the construction segments that affect our business the most are the single family residential segment  the commercial construction segment and  to a lesser degree  the public works infrastructure segment  both highway and non highway 
accordingly  the significant reduction in residential construction during has caused a corresponding drop in demand for our product 
unfortunately  the construction activity in the non residential sectors began to decline during which compounded the effect of the residential slowdown 
a prolonged decline in residential activity coinciding with a decline in one or more of the other sectors of the construction market could result in significant additional reductions in demand for our product 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated dollars in thousands years ended december  revenue related party revenue total revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense income tax benefit expense net income loss depreciation and amortization year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue declined to million for the year ended december   which we refer to as  from million for the year ended december   which we refer to as the decrease in revenue resulted from a decrease in sales of cubic yards of concrete  which we refer to as units  aggravated by a decrease of in the average unit sales price 
the overall demand for ready mix concrete has decreased and the average number of ready mix concrete providers has remained relatively the same in our market 
the result of this intense market competition has been a decreased average unit sales price 
the decreased volume in was due to the decline in the housing market  which has negatively affected our residential concrete customers and has created an overall slowdown in the construction sector of our market 
housing permits in our market have declined approximately when comparing to new home closings have declined approximately for the same period 
the commercial sector has experienced a severe slowdown resulting from the lack of available credit to continue to finance projects 
we also provide ready mix concrete to a related party 
related party revenue represented 
of our revenue compared to of our revenue 
location of the project  type of product needed and the availability of product and personnel are factors which we consider when quoting prices to our customers  including our related party 
based on that criteria  future sales to the related party could increase or decrease in any given year  but are not anticipated to be material 
we expect raw material prices and transport costs associated with those materials to remain stable during  thus it is unlikely that we will be raising our prices during gross profit 
gross profit decreased by to 
million for from million for and gross margin  as a percent of revenue  decreased to 
in from in gross profit margin can be affected by a variety of factors including utilization of our equipment  customers construction schedules  weather conditions and availability of raw materials 
the decrease in the gross profit margin during when compared to was primarily due to reduced sales volume  reduced average selling price  and higher fixed costs associated with the increased capacity completed during and early during  we will likely continue to under utilize equipment  but we expect long term margins will benefit from our expansion efforts 
our fixed costs are expected to remain consistent with through since we do not anticipate reducing our fleet or plant location through this current economic slowdown 
we expect our gross profit will suffer until the economy recovers  which we anticipate will be during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased 
million  or  to million for from million for this increase resulted from the additional plant  equipment and vehicles we placed in service in and the later part of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained flat at million for when compared to although the total remained consistent  the expenses which made up the total were different 
the primary expenses which changed year over year consisted of the following a 
million decrease in administrative salaries  wages  bonuses and related payroll taxes and a 
million decrease in public company expense  offset by a 
million increase in our bad debt expense 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased 
million  or  to 
million for from 
million for this decrease resulted from a decrease in our cash reserves compounded by the decrease in the rate of return paid by financial institutions 
interest expense decreased in to 
million compared to 
million for the decrease in interest expense was related to the repayment of a portion of our outstanding balance on our mortgage associated with our corporate building  thereby reducing interest expense 
interest expense associated with assets used to generate revenue is included in cost of revenue 
the interest included in cost of revenue during was 
million compared to 
million for the decrease in interest expense included in cost of revenue represents the decrease in debt obligations used to finance our plant  property and equipment 
we do not anticipate entering into any material financing agreements to acquire additional equipment or to fund working capital 
income taxes 
the income tax provision for decreased from an expense to a benefit in the amount of million  from 
million income tax expense for for  our effective income tax rate differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes and non deductible expenses 
net income loss 
net loss was million for as compared to net income of million for the decrease in net income resulted from a decrease in the volume of units sold  the reduced average selling price and under utilization of equipment as discussed above  which resulted from the continued slump of the residential construction sector and the overall decreased demand for ready mix concrete products as a result of the economic recession 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue declined to million for the year ended december   which we refer to as  from million for the year ended december   which we refer to as the decrease in revenue resulted from a decrease in sales of cubic yards of concrete  which we refer to as units  offset by an increase of in the average unit sales price 
the increased average unit sales price reflects a shift toward selling more expensive higher strength concrete typically used in commercial and infrastructure projects 
but  when comparing the average unit selling price by mix  prices were down across the board 
the decreased volume in was primarily attributable to the residential sector s continuing decline 
we provide ready mix concrete to a related party 
related party revenue represented and 
of our and revenue  respectively 
the increase in related party revenue when compared to was the result of the location of the projects  type of products needed and the availability of product and personnel 
location of the project  type of product needed and the availability of product and personnel are factors which we consider when quoting prices to our customers  including our related party 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased by to million for from million for and gross margin  as a percent of revenue  decreased to in from in gross profit margin can be affected by a variety of factors including customers construction schedules  weather conditions and availability of raw materials 
the decrease in gross profit and gross margin during resulted primarily from increased costs associated with the expansion of our operations  under utilizing new equipment placed in service and a decrease in the volume of units sold 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased 
million  or  to million for from million for this increase resulted from the additional plant  equipment and vehicles we placed in service in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase resulted primarily from a 
million increase in public company expense  a 
million increase in expenses associated with the ownership of our office facility in phoenix  arizona  offset by a 
million decrease in administrative salaries  wages  bonuses and related payroll taxes 
we record rent income associated with our office building to other income 
interest income and expense 
interest income for remained flat at 
million when compared to interest expense decreased in to 
million compared to 
million for the decrease in interest expense was related to the repayment of a portion of our outstanding balance on our line of credit  thereby reducing interest expense 
interest expense associated with assets used to generate revenue is included in cost of revenue 
the interest included in cost of revenue during was 
million compared to 
million for the increase in interest expense included in cost of revenue represents the increase in debt obligations used to finance our expansion efforts over the past year 
income taxes 
the income tax provision for decreased to 
million from million for for  our effective income tax rate differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes  non deductible expenses and the domestic production activities deduction 
net income 
net income was million for as compared to net income of million for the decrease in net income resulted from a decrease in the volume of units sold as discussed above and our under utilizing equipment  which resulted from the continued slow down of the residential construction sector 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary need for capital has been to increase the number of mixer trucks in our fleet  to increase the number of concrete batch plant locations  purchase support equipment at each location  secure and equip aggregate sources to allow a long term source and quality of the aggregate products used produce our concrete and provide working capital to support the expansion of our operations 
currently  we do not anticipate expanding our operations in the near term 
our current need for capital will be to supplement our lack of cash flow from operations to meet our debt repayment obligations 
historically  our largest provider of financing has been wells fargo equipment financing  inc  who we refer to as wfe 
our credit facility with wfe which provided a million revolving credit facility  as well as a million capital expenditure commitment  expired december  as of december   we had 
million outstanding on our expired revolving credit facility 
on february   we repaid 
million  the outstanding principal  on the revolving credit facility 
our capital expenditure commitment from wfe remains outstanding and as of december   we have drawn the principal amount of million on such commitment 
in addition  we amended the master security agreement with wfe to remove meadow valley s guarantee 
listed below are the amended covenants which are required to be maintained by the company as of december  and thereafter december  minimum amounts in thousands maximum actual leverage to 
to fixed charge coverage ratio 
to 
to available cash minimum dividends paid management fee agreement change of control sale or assignment of real estate leverage is defined as total liabilities to net worth 
measured quarterly 
fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as all interest bearing notes  loans and capital leases divided by the sum of net profit  interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization less dividends  plus or minus extraordinary expenses or gains  to be determined at wfe s sole discretion  for the previous four fiscal quarterly periods 
measured quarterly 
available cash minimum is defined as cash and cash equivalents as reported on the company s balance sheet 
measured quarterly 
dividends paid to shareholders will not be paid without the prior written consent of wfe 
management fee between meadow valley and ready mix will not exceed  per month 
reviewed quarterly 
change of control provision states that the company will be in default in the event that the board of directors ceases to consist of a majority of the current directors  without the written consent of wfe 
the company is prohibited from a entering into or assuming any agreement to sell  transfer or assign any of the company s owned real property and b creating or assuming any lien on any of the company s owned real property  in each case without written consent of wfe 
our amended security agreement also calls for a prepayment penalty 
the prepayment penalty is calculated on any prepaid principal balances paid prior to their scheduled due date 
the prepayment penalty is as follows on or before after after after december  prepayment penalty over the next months we do not anticipate any expansion of our plant or fleet of mixer trucks 
as a result of the expansion efforts over the past two and a half years  we have entered into debt and operating lease obligations which  in turn  have increased our total fixed minimum monthly payment obligations 
as a result of the downturn in the economy  operations did not provide the cash flow needed to meet the monthly obligations and cash reserves were utilized 
we do not expect this trend to continue  but cannot assure that cash flow from operations will be adequate to provide for the cash outflow needed to service all of our obligations  however we do anticipate that our cash reserves are sufficient to meet our needs over the next months 
the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain items from our statements of cash flows dollars in thousands for the years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities cash used in operating activities during of million represents an million decrease from the amount provided by operating activities during the change was primarily due to the net loss incurred in  coupled with an increase in our days sales outstanding and maintaining our payables within good credit terms 
cash used in investing activities during of 
million represents a million decrease from the amount used by investing activities during the decrease in investing activities during was due primarily to the completion of the expansion of our production facilities and equipment to be used at those locations 
cash used in financing activities during of million represents a 
million increase from the amount used in financing activities during the increase in cash used in financing activities during was the result of the repayment of debt obligations 
cash provided by operating activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount provided by operating activities during the change was primarily due to the decrease in our outstanding accounts receivable  which is a result of reduced sales and continued emphasis on collections  a reduction in our refundable deposits and the change in depreciation expense year over year  offset by lower net income  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  also a result of reduced sales 
cash used in investing activities during of million represents a million decrease from the amount used by investing activities during the decrease in investing activities during was due primarily to the completion of the expansion of our production facilities and equipment to be used at those locations 
cash used in financing activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount used in financing activities during the increase in cash used in financing activities during was the result of the repayment of debt obligations 
summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods  are summarized as follows payments due by period dollars in thousands less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt obligations interest payments on long term debt operating leases obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations interest payments are based on the individual interest rates of each obligation  which range from to per annum 
we do not assume an increase in the variable interest rate 
see note line of credit and note notes payable in the notes to the financial statements included in item other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap include an administrative services agreement with meadow valley in the amount of  per month 
the term of the agreement is month to month and although either party can cancel the agreement we anticipate remaining in the agreement at least until december  impact of inflation we may experience increases in the cost of our raw materials and the transport of those materials 
given the current downward pressure on pricing due to the dramatic decrease in demand  we are not always able to pass on additional costs  thereby possibly decreasing our margins 
increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  or material or subcontractor costs could also adversely affect our operations in future periods 
therefore  inflation may have a negative material impact on our operations to the extent that we cannot pass on higher costs to our customers 
critical accounting estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described below and in note summary of significant accounting policies and use of estimates to our financial statements included in item reportable segments we currently operate our business within one reportable segment of operation 
all of the revenue from our customers is substantially from the sale of ready mix concrete 
ready mix concrete can have many different variations and characteristics  from the strength of the concrete to its color and consistency 
however  we do not maintain the quantity or dollar amount of each variation of our product sold as the variations in the ready mix concrete sales are simply variations of ready mix concrete 
we also sell sand  aggregate and decorative colored rock from our production facility in moapa  nevada  but the primary purpose of this production facility is to provide us with more control over quality and assurance of timely availability of a portion of the raw materials used in the product we sell to customers 
the revenue generated from the sale of sand  aggregate and decorative colored rock represented and of our gross revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  we view the market similarities between the phoenix  arizona and the las vegas  nevada metropolitan areas to be of such a similar nature that we do not distinguish between them for financial statement reporting purposes 
collectibility of account receivables we are required to estimate the collectibility of our account receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer and the related aging of the past due balances 
our provision for bad debt as of december  and amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in our provision for bad debt as of december  represented two large customers incurring dramatic financial pressures as a result of the financial market meltdown and the overall economic slowdown  in addition  the use of our historic bad debt rate  identifying specific accounts potentially uncollectible and write offs in the amount of approximately  during we determine our reserve by using percentages  derived from our collection history  applied to certain types of revenue generated  as well as a review of the individual accounts outstanding 
the increase in the provision for bad debt for the year ended december  represented an increase in the specific account balances identified as potentially uncollectible during the year ended december  should our estimate for the provision of bad debt not be sufficient to allow for the write off of future bad debts we will incur additional bad debt expense  thereby reducing net income in a future period 
if  on the other hand  we determine in the future that we have over estimated our provision for bad debt we will reduce bad debt expense  thereby increasing net income in a future period 
furthermore  if one or more major customers fail to pay us  it would significantly affect our current results as well as future estimates 
we pursue our lien rights to minimize our exposure to delinquent accounts 
valuation of property and equipment we are required to report property and equipment  net of depreciation and amortization expense 
we expense depreciation and amortization utilizing the straight line method over what we believe to be the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
the estimated useful lives of property and equipment are batch and mining plants years buildings years computer equipment years equipment years leasehold improvements years office furniture and equipment years vehicles years the useful life on any piece of equipment can vary  even within the same category of equipment  due to the quality of the maintenance  care provided by the operator and the general environmental conditions  such as temperature  weather severity and the terrain in which the equipment operates 
we maintain  service and repair the majority of our equipment through the use of our mechanics 
if we inaccurately estimate the life of any given piece of equipment or category of equipment we may be overstating or understating earnings in any given period 
we also review our property and equipment  including land and water rights  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the impairments are recognized in the period during which they are identified 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheets 
we must calculate the blended tax rate  combining all applicable tax jurisdictions  which can vary over time as a result of the allocation of taxable income between the tax jurisdictions and the changes in tax rates 
we must also assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets  if any  will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   the company had total deferred tax assets of 
million with no valuation allowance and total deferred tax liabilities of million 
the deferred tax asset does not contain a valuation allowance as we believe we will be able to utilize the deferred tax asset through future taxable income 
furthermore  we are subject to periodic review by domestic tax authorities for audit of our income tax returns 
these audits generally include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the amount and timing of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  including federal and state taxes  we believe we have complied with the rules of the service codes and therefore have not recorded reserves for any possible exposure 
typically the taxing authorities can audit the previous three years of tax returns and in certain situations audit additional years  therefore a significant amount of time may pass before an audit is conducted and fully resolved 
although no audits are currently being conducted  if a taxing authority would require us to amend a prior year s tax return we would record the increase or decrease in our tax obligation in the year in which it is more likely than not to be realized 
classification of leases we follow the standards established by statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  sfas 
one factor when determining if a lease is an operating lease or a capital lease is the intention from the inception of the lease regarding the final ownership  or transfer of title  of the asset to be leased 
we are currently leasing ready mix trucks under operating lease agreements  since at the inception of those leases we had not intended to take title to those vehicles at the conclusion of the leases 
therefore  we did not request transfer of ownership provisions at the conclusion of the leases such as bargain purchase options or direct transfers of ownership 
since we do not intend to take ownership at the conclusion of the leases and we do not meet the remaining criteria of sfas for capitalization  the leases are classified as operating leases 
if we had desired at the inception of the leases to have the ownership transferred to us at the conclusion of the leases  we would have classified those leases as capital leases and would have recorded the ready mix trucks as assets on our balance sheet as well as recording the liability as capital lease obligations 
we believe that the lease expense under the operating lease classification approximates the depreciation expense which would have been incurred if the leases had been classified as capital leases 
stock based compensation we use the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  to value share based payment awards 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted 
in accordance with sfas r we use the black scholes option valuation model to value the share based payment awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note stock based compensation in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on february   the fasb issued fsp fas which defers the effective date of sfas for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we adopted sfas on january   except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas the partial adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fsp fas in march  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas requires companies with derivative instruments to disclose information that should enable financial statement users to understand how and why a company uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued fsp  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 issuer s accounting for liabilities measured at fair value with a third party credit enhancement eitf 
eitf provides guidance for measuring liabilities issued with an attached third party credit enhancement such as a guarantee 
it clarifies that the issuer of a liability with a third party credit enhancement such as a guarantee should not include the effect of the credit enhancement in the fair value measurement of the liability 
eitf is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  the implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
known and anticipated future trends and contingencies we have grown steadily since our inception and we plan to continue to exploit opportunities within our markets 
in the current housing downturn  there are few alternatives other than to keep our costs to a minimum  do our best to maintain our existing customer base and effectively compete for the projects that are going forward 
in the long term  the key dynamics of employment and population growth within our geographic markets appear to present us with continued growth opportunities 
we believe that demand for construction materials will steadily improve once the residential sector recovers from its current downturn 
we also believe that the supply of raw materials has increased and shortages of key raw materials will be less likely in the future than we experienced in the recent past 
in light of the rising need for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current need to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
there is also a trend toward local and state legislation regulating growth and urban sprawl 
the passage of such legislation and the degree of growth limits imposed by legislation could dramatically affect the nature of our markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not have foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price market risk 
interest rate risk from time to time we temporarily invest our excess cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
we monitor risk exposure to monies invested in securities in our financial institutions 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long term debt obligations 
we manage our exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a basis point increase in the prime interest rate at december  the potential increase in the fair value of our debt obligations would have been approximately 
million at december  see note line of credit and note notes payable in the accompanying december  financial statements included in item
