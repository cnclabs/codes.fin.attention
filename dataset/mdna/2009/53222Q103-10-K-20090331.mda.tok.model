on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources

the company believes that the following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods sourced from third party suppliers 
inventory also includes finished goods  work in process and raw materials related to the company s manufacture of sterling silver products 
inventory is priced by the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market method 
consistent with the seasonality of the company s business  inventory generally increases  beginning late in the second quarter of the year  and reaches a peak at the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter  and declines thereafter 
the company periodically reviews and analyzes inventory based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  future product demand for items and estimated profitability of merchandise 
when appropriate  the company writes down inventory to net realizable value 
revenue recognition the company sells products wholesale to retailers and distributors and retail  direct to the consumer through the company s factory and outlet store  catalog and internet operations 
wholesale sales are recognized when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer 
store sales are recognized at the time of sale 
catalog and internet sales are recognized upon receipt by the customer 
shipping and handling fees that are billed to customers in sales transactions are recorded in net sales 
net sales exclude taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to the taxing authorities 
receivables the company periodically reviews the collectibility of its accounts receivable and establishes allowances for estimated losses that could result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of these receivables including assessing the credit worthiness of each wholesale customer 
the company also maintains an allowance for sales returns and customer chargebacks 
to evaluate the adequacy of the sales returns and customer chargeback allowances the company analyzes currently available information and historical trends 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or the company s estimate of sales returns was determined to be inadequate  additional allowances may be required
