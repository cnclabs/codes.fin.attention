table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop tiny  sustained release  drug delivery products that are administered by implantation  injection or insertion 
once administered  the drug is released on a controlled and level basis for months or years 
our phase iii partnered product  which utilizes the third generation of our durasert technology system  delivers fa for the treatment of dme 
this product candidate  formerly known as medidur fa for dme  is licensed to alimera  which is conducting fully recruited phase iii clinical trials 
alimera expects that month interim data from these clinical trials will be available in late and plans to file an nda with the fda in early alimera intends to commercialize the product under the name iluvien 
we have a collaboration agreement with alimera  pursuant to which we have licensed certain of our drug delivery technologies to alimera for the development of iluvien and certain other ophthalmic products 
our two fda approved sustained release products to treat chronic back of the eye diseases are our second generation retisert for the treatment of posterior uveitis and our first generation vitrasert for the treatment of aids related cmv retinitis 
we have licensed both of these products and the technologies underlying them to bausch lomb 
biosilicon  our other principal technology system  is a fully erodible  nanostructured  porous silicon designed to provide sustained delivery of various therapeutics  including small drug molecules  proteins and peptides 
our lead biosilicon product candidate  brachysil  delivers therapeutic p  a radioactive form of phosphorus used to treat cancer  directly to solid tumors 
we have completed an initial safety and efficacy clinical trial of brachysil for the treatment of pancreatic cancer  which indicated that brachysil  in combination with standard chemotherapy  was well tolerated with no clinically significant adverse events related to brachysil 
we are nearing completion of a follow on dose ranging clinical trial for brachysil 
our strategic plan is to seek a development partner in advance of commencing a pivotal phase iii clinical trial 
based on our early pre clinical phase  we are currently targeting biosilicon as a key second prong of our drug delivery platform 
we also have a worldwide collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer under which pfizer may develop additional ophthalmic products based on certain of our technologies 
effective june   we reincorporated from western australia to the united states the reincorporation 
equity financing in july  we sold  units at a price of per unit for gross proceeds of million 
each unit consisted of i one share of common stock  and ii one warrant to purchase share of common stock at per share 
in addition  we simultaneously completed a sale of  units for gross proceeds of approximately million 

table of contents license and collaboration agreements alimera on march   we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with alimera 
in exchange for aggregate consideration of up to approximately million  we agreed to a share in the future profits of iluvien and any other licensed products developed under the amended agreement 
aggregate consideration consisted of i million in cash received upon the execution of the amended agreement  ii cancellation of million of accrued development cost liabilities  including related penalties and accrued interest  owed by us to alimera as of march   iii conditional principal and interest payments of up to approximately million through september under a note issued by alimera  iv a million milestone payment upon fda approval of iluvien for the treatment of dme  v reimbursement of approved development costs we incur in support of the ongoing clinical studies of iluvien for the treatment of dme and anticipated regulatory submissions  and vi the assumption by alimera of all financial responsibility for the development of licensed products under the amended agreement  the result of which is the elimination of an estimated million of development cost obligations that would otherwise have been payable by us to alimera in connection with the development of iluvien during the period from april through the completion of the development process under the original collaboration agreement 
pursuant to the amended agreement  a total of million of deferred revenue is being recognized ratably over a period of months from the amendment effective date through december   which represents the period of our performance obligations 
following consummation of the amended agreement  we received conditional note payments and reimbursements of approved development costs totaling approximately million and  during the years ended june  and  respectively 
this cash consideration  and future cash consideration received by us from alimera during the remainder of the performance period  is being recognized ratably over the performance period  including immediate revenue recognition catch up for the pro rata period from the amendment effective date to the date of each receipt 
pfizer under our worldwide collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer  beginning in calendar year and continuing until commencement of the first phase iii clinical trial  pfizer has agreed to provide us with a minimum of  per quarter in research funding 
to date  the joint research program has been limited to pre clinical studies 
under the agreement  we are also entitled to receive clinical development milestone payments and  following commercialization of any products  sales based milestones and royalties 
bausch lomb bausch lomb sells vitrasert and retisert 
although our collaboration agreement with bausch lomb provides for royalties on such sales  in june cds received a million advance from bausch lomb in lieu of million of future retisert royalties that otherwise would be payable 
bausch lomb became entitled to retain of the first million of royalties otherwise payable  or million  and of the next million of royalties otherwise payable 
during the years ended june  and  we received and  in retisert royalty payments 
subsequent to june   bausch lomb will be entitled to retain the next million of royalties otherwise payable  following which we will resume receiving of the retisert royalties 
based on historical retisert sales volumes  we currently expect that the resumption of the receipt of retisert royalties will not occur until at least the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ending june  intrinsiq in connection with a january exclusive field of use license with intrinsiq for nutraceutical and food science applications of biosilicon  we received license fee payments of  and  during the years ended june  and  respectively 
in addition  subject to intrinsiq s unilateral right to terminate the 
table of contents license upon days prior written notice  we are entitled to receive scheduled minimum royalties of million through april  of which the first  payment was received in july for the year ending june   we are entitled to the receipt of quarterly royalties earned  if any 
the next scheduled minimum royalty payment of  is due in january summary of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires that we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and judgments include revenue recognition and the carrying value of our intangible assets 
we base our estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience  anticipated results and trends and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances at the time 
by their nature  these estimates  judgments and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of these financial statements 
revenue recognition for license agreements the terms of our collaborative license and development arrangements typically include multiple deliverables by us for example  license rights  providing research and development services and manufacturing of clinical materials in exchange for consideration to us of some combination of non refundable license fees  funding of research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits 
we follow the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
sab  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
with the exception of royalties  these types of consideration are classified as collaborative research and development revenue in our statements of operations when revenue recognition is appropriate 
we recognize non refundable license fees as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
we analyze multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements  to determine whether the deliverables can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if we determine the license either i does not have stand alone value or ii has stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
for arrangements that are accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we recognize total payments under the arrangement as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations using the cumulative catch up method 
under this method  the portion of any such payment represented by the time elapsed from the commencement of the performance period to the payment date as a percentage of the total performance period will be recognized immediately as revenue  with the remainder amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining performance period 
all payments received following the end of the performance period will be recognized as revenue when earned 

table of contents we limit the cumulative amount of revenue earned to the cumulative amount of payments received as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
we then recognize revenue over the remaining estimated period of performance 
deferred revenue amounts are classified as current liabilities to the extent that revenue is expected to be recognized within one year 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
for the years ended june  and  we reported collaborative research and development revenue of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  substantially all of these revenues were attributable to our march amended and restated collaboration agreement with alimera 
valuation of intangible assets we review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life of the asset is no longer appropriate 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant change relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant industry or economic trends and developments 
if an impairment trigger is identified  an impairment test is performed based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the recorded carrying value of the asset 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
at june   we evaluated the recoverability of our retisert intangible asset based upon revised sales trend information and the receipt of formal confirmation in july of our prior understanding from industry sources that bausch lomb had withdrawn its european application for authorization to market retisert 
the valuation assessment required detailed analysis of projected future cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
for retisert  a commercialized product with two years of sales history  these projections required the application of judgments and estimates that included market penetration rates  estimated market growth  potential impact of new technologies under development  penetration rate for re implants and an appropriate weighted average cost of capital rate to discount the future cash flows 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded an impairment write down of million in connection with our retisert patents 
we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted cashflows related to existing contractual agreements as well as projected cashflows from potential future research and development collaboration agreements 
in the event that actual cashflows are less than those projected  we may be required in the future to take impairment charges with respect to some or all of the million of intangible assets that appear on our balance sheet as of june  
table of contents results of operations years ended june  and year ended june  change amounts in thousands except percentages revenues operating expenses impairment of goodwill   na research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss from continuing operations other income expense change in fair value of derivatives interest income interest and finance costs other income  net total other income expense loss before income taxes income tax benefit net loss na not applicable revenues revenues increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended june  fiscal from approximately million for the year ended june  fiscal 
in each fiscal year  revenues were almost entirely attributable to our collaboration agreement with alimera  consisting of i the portion of the upfront license consideration that we recognized in the given fiscal year  and ii the aggregate of conditional note payments and reimbursement of our development costs received from alimera that we recognized in the given fiscal year 
for the year ending june   assuming continued payment of scheduled conditional note payments from alimera and the reimbursement of remaining development costs during the performance period  we currently expect to record collaborative research and development revenue attributable to the alimera collaboration agreement of approximately million 
pursuant to a june side letter to the collaboration agreement with bausch lomb  cds received million from bausch lomb as an advance payment in lieu of million of future retisert royalties that otherwise would have been payable under our collaboration agreement with bausch lomb 
bausch lomb became entitled to retain of the first million of royalties otherwise payable  or million  and of the next million of royalties otherwise payable 
thereafter  we are entitled to receive of the royalties to which we are otherwise entitled under the collaboration agreement 
during fiscal  bausch lomb retained approximately million of retisert royalties that otherwise would have been payable to us  as compared to approximately million during fiscal as of june   bausch lomb is entitled to retain an additional million of future retisert royalties otherwise payable to us 
accordingly  we currently do not expect to record royalty income on sales of retisert by bausch lomb until at least the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ending june  
table of contents impairment of goodwill in fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million equal to the total carrying value of goodwill 
see note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
research and development research and development decreased by approximately million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors the absence in fiscal of million of iluvien co development costs incurred in fiscal as a result of the assumption by alimera of all financial responsibility for the development of licensed products pursuant to the amendment and restatement of our collaboration agreement with alimera  and a decrease in fiscal of approximately million in uk based research and development costs  of which approximately million was attributable to the relative strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling and approximately  was primarily attributable to reduced levels of personnel  legal  facilities and depreciation expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative costs decreased by approximately million  or  to approximately million for fiscal from million for fiscal this net decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors the absence of approximately million of costs incurred in fiscal directly attributable to the reincorporation  a decrease of approximately million of audit  tax  financial reporting consulting services and legal fees primarily as a result of the reincorporation and the absence in fiscal of costs incurred in fiscal in connection with the amendment and restatement of the collaboration agreement with alimera  the absence of approximately  of personnel  facility and travel costs associated with the fiscal closing of our perth  australia office  partially offset by an approximate million increase in provision for losses on the note receivable from gem  and an approximate  increase in us personnel and benefit costs related to the march severance agreement with our former vice president  finance and chief financial officer 
change in fair value of derivatives change in fair value of derivatives decreased by approximately million  or  to income of  for fiscal from income of million for fiscal during fiscal and the year ended june  fiscal  we recorded the value of detachable warrants issued in share offerings denominated in australian dollars a as a derivative liability  subject to revaluation at subsequent reporting dates 
the change in fair value of derivative for each year  determined using the black scholes valuation model  was impacted primarily by a net decrease in the market price of our shares in each period 

table of contents we will be required to assess the fair value of these warrants at each subsequent balance sheet date  and changes in their fair values will result in adjustments to our recorded derivative liabilities  and a corresponding gain or loss in our statement of operations 
fluctuations in the fair values of these warrants could be substantial and could continue to affect our operating results until the last to expire of these warrants in july interest income interest income decreased by  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  primarily due to i a combination of decreased levels of interest bearing cash balances and sharply lower weighted average interest rates  and ii the absence in the current year of approximately  of interest accrued in fiscal on the million note receivable due from gem 
interest expense interest expense of  was accrued during fiscal on the portion of shared iluvien product candidate co development costs that we elected not to pay under the original alimera collaboration agreement 
in connection with the march amendment and restatement of that agreement  the total co development costs  including associated penalties and accrued interest  which we then owed to alimera were cancelled and  accordingly  no interest expense was incurred during fiscal other income  net other income  net decreased by  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the absence in fiscal of  of income in fiscal attributable to a revenue sharing arrangement under the adr program  which was terminated as a result of the reincorporation  partially offset by net unrealized foreign exchange gains of  in fiscal resulting from the write off of foreign currency translation reserve balances in connection with the dissolution of subsidiaries 
income tax benefit income tax benefit increased by approximately  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to approximately  of foreign research and development tax credits earned by our uk subsidiary  partially offset by a  reduction in us deferred tax benefits

this increase was partially offset by the absence in fiscal of  of retisert royalties earned in fiscal as a result of the terms of the side letter to the collaboration agreement with bausch lomb 
impairment of goodwill fiscal included a million goodwill impairment charge as compared to fiscal  which had no impairment charges 
impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets totaled million for fiscal as a result of a reduction in our assessment of the recoverability of the carrying value of the retisert patents 
there was no such impairment charge in fiscal 
table of contents research and development research and development decreased by approximately million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the following factors a net decrease of approximately million in amortization of intangibles  primarily resulting from the impairment of our retisert patents at june  and  to a lesser extent  the effect of an increase in the estimated useful life of the biosilicon technology as of december   and a decrease of approximately million in uk and singapore based operating expenses as a result of i significant head count reductions in the uk in fiscal  ii reduced levels of clinical trial program activities  and iii reduced depreciation expense principally related to a clean room facility that was fully depreciated as of march  partially offset by an increase of approximately million in co development costs related to the phase iii clinical trial of the iluvien product candidate through march  as a result of the amendment and restatement of our collaboration agreement with alimera 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase of approximately million of professional fees and other transactional costs incurred in fiscal in connection with the reincorporation 
change in fair value of derivatives change in fair value of derivatives decreased by approximately million  or  to income of million for fiscal from income of million for fiscal during fiscal and  we recorded the value of detachable warrants issued in share offerings denominated in australian dollars a as a derivative liability  subject to revaluation at subsequent reporting dates 
the change in fair value of derivative related to these warrants resulted in income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  primarily attributable to a net decrease in the market price of our shares during the periods 
we recorded derivative liabilities in connection with the conversion option feature of our convertible note issued in november  as amended  and our convertible notes issued in september these derivative liabilities were revalued at market from inception until the notes were redeemed 
the change in fair value of these derivative liabilities through the redemption of the convertible notes in may and june resulted in income of million for fiscal interest income interest income increased by  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal  primarily due to increased levels of interest bearing cash balances resulting from the proceeds of a july offering and the initial million cash consideration received in march in connection with the amendment and restatement of our collaboration agreement with alimera and an increase of approximately  of interest accrued on a note receivable 

table of contents interest and finance costs interest and finance costs decreased by approximately million  or  to  for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was attributable to a decrease of million in interest expense primarily as the result of the redemption of our convertible notes that were redeemed in may and june  the absence of million of amortization of debt discount and issue costs in connection with our convertible notes  and the absence of million of registration rights penalties incurred in fiscal year in connection with our convertible note agreements 
loss on extinguishment of debt loss on extinguishment of debt totaled million for fiscal  which consisted primarily of i million for the value of warrants issued as additional consideration for amendments to our convertible notes that were accounted for as extinguishments of debt  and ii approximately million of cash premiums paid in connection with redemptions of the convertible notes 
other income  net other income  net increased by  or  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal this increase consisted primarily of  of income in fiscal attributable to the adr program  partially offset by a  net unfavorable change in foreign exchange gains and losses 
income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased by approximately million  or  to  for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the fact that in fiscal our ability to record tax benefits associated with losses incurred was limited by the amount of deferred tax liabilities recorded 
since june   we have been required to establish valuation allowances to offset the tax benefit of all net operating loss carryforwards due to uncertainty that we will be able to use these carryforwards 
loss from discontinued operations in april  we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of million in connection with the sale of the stock of our aion diagnostics subsidiary 
proceeds consisted of approximately million in cash and a million unsecured promissory note  bearing interest compounded monthly 
loss from discontinued operations in fiscal through the date of sale was million 
inflation and seasonality our management believes inflation has not had a material impact on our operations or financial condition and that our operations are not currently subject to seasonal influences

sfasr is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  as well as the subsequent recognition of acquired deferred tax benefits of previous acquisitions 
we will be required to adopt sfas r in connection business combination transactions  if any  after june  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and  at june   we had a total accumulated deficit of million 
our research and development and general and administrative costs  in the aggregate  have exceeded our revenues  including revenues related to our two commercialized products  and  accordingly  our operations have historically generated negative cash flows 
we generally expect negative cash flows from operations on a quarterly basis at least until such time as one or more of our product candidates achieves regulatory approval and achieves sufficient sales 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on sales of our equity and debt securities and the proceeds from license fees and collaboration payments to fund our operations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately million at june  compared to million at june  we believe we can fund our operations as currently conducted through at least december  this expectation is based on certain key assumptions that include i continued receipt from pfizer of quarterly  research and development funding  ii alimera s continued funding of the development of iluvien  and iii the continued receipt of the scheduled conditional note payments from alimera 
management has identified contingency plans in the event of a significant shortfall in payments  focused primarily on reduced spending for non critical activities 
whether and when we will require  or desire to raise  additional capital will depend upon many other factors  including  but not limited to the continuation of our existing collaborations with pfizer and alimera  including their continued funding of our programs and our receipt of milestone  royalty  note and other payments  the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of iluvien  the amount and timing of sales of retisert  which affect the timing of the resumption of retisert royalty payments and the amount of such royalty payments  the scope and extent of our internally funded existing operations and programs including any phase iii trials for brachysil for pancreatic cancer  any new product candidates and any new business opportunities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic arrangements for brachysil or any other product candidates for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  the success of our products and product candidates  including the timing and costs of regulatory approvals and the commercial success of approved products  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims  and changes in our operating plan  including the pursuit of new business opportunities  which may affect our need for capital 
absent adequate levels of funding from new collaboration agreements and or financing transactions  management currently believes that our cash position beyond december  will be substantially dependent upon the timing of fda approval and the initiation and success of marketing of iluvien  and the resulting 
table of contents occurrence of certain milestone events under the terms of our collaboration agreement with alimera 
alimera has agreed to pay us million upon fda approval of iluvien for dme and a share in the future profits of iluvien 
in addition  the million note issued by alimera becomes due and payable upon the occurrence of certain defined liquidity events such as an initial public offering of alimera that result in aggregate proceeds to alimera in excess of million 
there is no assurance that the fda will approve iluvien  or that iluvien will achieve market acceptance even if it is approved by the fda 
there is similarly no assurance that a liquidity event resulting in aggregate proceeds to alimera in excess of million will occur 
the downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets have made it significantly more difficult and more expensive to obtain financing 
if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital in the future  we do not know if it will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if available  additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and potential dilutive equity  and funding through collaboration agreements may be on unfavorable terms  including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products 
if adequate financing is not available if and when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  postpone the pursuit of product candidates and new business opportunities  or otherwise reduce our cash requirements 
cash to fund working capital requirements is managed centrally  with most cash deposits maintained in us dollars 
our consolidated statements of historical cash flows are summarized as follows year ended june  in thousands loss from continuing operations changes in operating assets and liabilities other adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in operating activities of continuing operations cash flows used in operating activities of discontinued operations cash flows used in provided by investing activities of continuing operations cash flows provided by investing activities of discontinued operations cash flows provided by financing activities net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  increased by approximately million compared to the prior year 
the largest contributing factor was the impact of the march amendment and restatement of our collaboration agreement with alimera

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to changes in the valuation of derivative liabilities  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative liabilities at june   the balance of our derivative liabilities  which are related to warrants denominated in a  totaled  and was determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the change in fair value of derivatives resulted in income of  and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our financial position and results of operations will continue to be sensitive to future revaluations of these derivative liabilities 
at june   these warrants had a weighted average remaining contractual life of years and a weighted average exercise price of per share compared to the nasdaq closing price of our common shares 
the primary factor that impacts the change in fair value of these derivatives is fluctuations in our share price 
reduction of the remaining useful life of the warrants  assuming that share price remains constant  would result in a significant decrease of the derivative liability value during the fiscal year ending june  based on the relatively short remaining life of the underlying warrants 
changes in risk free interest rates have a de minimis effect 
the following table summarizes the sensitivity of our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal to assumed increases or decreases of our share price at june  decrease in share price current price increase in share price in thousands change in fair value of derivatives income expense foreign currency exchange rates we conduct operations in two principal currencies  the us dollar and the pound sterling 
the us dollar is the functional currency for our us operations and the pound sterling is the functional currency for our uk operations 
changes in the foreign exchange rate of the us dollar and pound sterling impact the net operating expenses of our uk operations 
for fiscal  the strengthening of the uk dollar compared to fiscal resulted in a net decrease in research and development expense of approximately million 
all cash and cash equivalents  and most other asset and liability balances  are denominated in each entity s functional currency and  accordingly  we do not consider our statement of operation exposure to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses to be significant 
changes in the foreign exchange rate of the us dollar and pound sterling also impact total stockholders equity 
during fiscal  the relative strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the pound sterling resulted in a net decrease of million in stockholders equity due to the translation of approximately million of net assets of our uk operations  predominantly the biosilicon technology intangible asset  into us dollars 
for every incremental strengthening or weakening of the us dollar at june  in relation to the pound sterling  our stockholders equity at june  would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately  interest rates cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to variable interest rates 
we do not consider our exposure to interest rates to be significant
