annual performance summary net income and earnings per share dollars in thousands except per share amounts income loss from continuing operations regulated electric utility unregulated utility services other income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations unregulated engineering services unregulated software technology income loss from discontinued operations net income basic income per share the other line in continuing operations includes activities of the holding company including corporate costs directly associated with unregulated operations and common costs not allocated to the regulated utility and inter company eliminations 
other in discontinued operations is inter company eliminations 
mam s consolidated net income increased million from million in to million these improved results translated to more than times the earnings per share  an increase of per share 
although the increase in net income includes a one time gain on foreign exchange from liquidation of  the increase also includes over million in overall improved earnings performance from continuing operations 
the improved financial performance was recognized by the market through the continued solid pricing of our stock 
as illustrated in the chart below  the average daily closing price of our stock increased by over 
table of contents  and by compared with according to edison electric institute eei  mam had a total shareholder return of in  the second highest among the eei index companies  in a year when only five of the companies had a positive return 
logo in spite of this success  was not without its share of financial challenges 
while our overall financial performance trended upward in almost all categories  there were negative trends that caused some concern in specific areas mps electric sales were down modestly in the residential category when compared to the prior year and were down sharply for the large commercial segment compared to these trends appear to be a product of the overall poor economy which encouraged people to focus more on the cost of energy as well as the overall costs of being in business 
while we do not expect this trend to continue for residential users  because conservation has its limits  we do expect continuing challenges for our commercial customers in the wood and lumber industry unless the market for those products improves 
accounts receivable at mps have been affected by the continuing increase in the price of the energy and are up  or over the prior year 
while mps is not in the generation business  the combination of the price of energy with transmission and distribution costs causes customers in a depressed economy to pay slower  negotiate additional payment arrangements  and incur slightly higher bad debts 
dollars under payment arrangements  which usually do not involve any form of discount  are up by 
in response  we have increased our reserve for bad debts from at the end of to at the end of while these are not positive trends  we have not experienced as large a slide in these metrics as other investor owned utilities in our region 
was the first full year of operation for our unregulated affiliate  mam usg 
while mam usg contributed million of revenue  the segment incurred an overall loss 
see more detailed discussion of mam usg below as part of unregulated utility services 

table of contents overview of company strategy we are pleased with our progress during and however  we realize it is of critical importance that we continue to operate efficiently and to pursue investments to further solidify the company and the future interests of our shareholders 
our basic strategy has remained unchanged from last year efficiently manage and maximize our existing regulated utility operations  and utilize our utility related core competencies to pursue other unregulated opportunities 
utility operations our strategy for our existing franchise as a regulated electric transmission and distribution utility has not changed 
we have been serving customers in our territory for over a century 
what was true during that span and remains true today is our objective to provide our customers with safe  reliable and competitively priced electricity service while targeting a fair regulated return on investment for our shareholders 
while we are challenged by our low customer density  slow economic growth  and rugged geography  we are proud to be able to provide rates that are competitive with other larger utilities 
in order to continue providing these services for another one hundred years and beyond  we must continue to efficiently manage and properly invest in our utility asset infrastructure 
during  and over the next few years  mps has made and will continue to make substantial investments in our core electrical system 
capital expenditures for were approximately million 
for  capital expenditures will be approximately million  with each year s capital budget being reviewed and approved by our board 
these capital expenditures are relatively large compared to past years as a result of matching our strong cash flows during the next three years from our regulatory asset stranded costs collections with our capital improvement needs 
the investments in these assets will help provide regulated returns to our shareholders during their useful life  assuming favorable regulatory treatment 
what has changed tactically in our utility operation strategy is our pursuit of transmission alternatives 
our interest in transmission construction alternatives originated from interconnection requests filed by potential generation developers within and adjacent to our service territory 
as noted in item a 
above  mps continues to pursue development of a transmission line  which  among other things  would support development of renewable generation 
during the past year  we disclosed in sec filings the company s efforts to obtain approval for the proposed mpc project described under item a 
above 
pursuant to a joint development agreement with cmp  the company sought mpuc approval and filed a request with iso ne for allowance of the cost of the mpc project to be regionalized in iso ne transmission rates as a market efficiency transmission upgrade in order to permit the delivery of renewable power to the new england market 
as is typical for a large and complicated series of regulatory proceedings  we have experienced our share of ups and downs during the last year 
on the positive side were several items that supported our filing  including ferc supported our proposal and granted regulated incentive rate treatment which would have provided for a rate of return on equity for the proposed transmission investment  contingent on other approvals  ferc approved our recovery of prudently incurred costs to pursue this transmission development if the line is not built for reasons beyond our control  thereby reducing investment risks  regional support for reducing new england s carbon footprint and dependence on foreign oil as it strives to meet the regional greenhouse gas initiative goals  political support from the state of maine to provide transmission development for renewable energy  particularly wind  
table of contents support of local and state economic development agencies  encouragement from energy developers to provide a line to deliver their product to the new england marketplace where supply is needed  and national support  in general  for investments in infrastructure  smart grid technologies  and renewable energy solutions  including the transmission infrastructure necessary to support them 
parties opposing the project cited a number of concerns  including whether the cost of the project is likely to outweigh its projected regional benefit  whether our service territory  and the state of maine ratepayers in general  should absorb the rate increases stemming from the project  whether the generation developers should be responsible for some or all of the cost of providing transmission service to their projects  whether mps should pursue a project that effectively required it to join iso ne at a time when the mpuc  in docket no 
 is investigating whether to order the withdrawal of maine s utilities from iso ne  whether the project is reasonable in light of the preliminary findings of complex electrical studies showing that under certain extreme contingencies  the project would have adverse impacts on the new england grid  since solving these problems would increase the estimated project costs  whether other competing projects  both generation developments as well as transmission solutions  would better serve customers  the overall situation in the national economy  which makes it more challenging for developers to pursue projects  and risks associated with wind generation development and whether proposed wind generation projects were at a satisfactory stage in development supporting the current proposed project as described in the regulatory findings 
as we reported in form k filings during january  our request for mpc project regulatory approval in the state of maine has been dismissed by the mpuc 
however  as the mpuc s order dismissing the case included statements encouraging the project sponsors to continue to pursue transmission options that would facilitate the delivery of renewable energy from northern maine  and address the lack of liquidity in the northern maine market 
to that end  the mpc team is pursuing a number of related alternatives including revising the physical scope of the project to make it a smaller project a mw  shorter project  or a larger project extending the project to canada  pursuing alternatives to the market efficiency transmission upgrade model  possibly including a participant funded approach  identifying an approach that avoids having mps join iso ne  and or pursuing federal economic stimulus funds aimed at right sizing transmission infrastructure to accommodate the development of renewable generation 
we continue to believe that a northern maine interconnection such as the mpc project would generate substantial benefits to our service territory  the state of maine ratepayers and municipalities  and the new england region  and would also be consistent with national energy policy make logical and economic sense 
while it would be impossible for us to predict an outcome at this point  we think it is in the best interests of our customers and shareholders to continue our quest to connect the mps territory to the rest of maine and new 
table of contents england 
future efforts may involve a project which is different  at least in part 
as previously reported and as discussed above under item a  recent developments have caused mps to reevaluate the scope of the project and to also consider alternative means of constructing a transmission line to allow mps to interconnect its system with the new england grid and to support renewable energy projects in its service territory 
unregulated services a key portion of our strategy is to provide complementary services to our regulated utility operations by utilizing our core competencies 
mam  as the holding company  formed an unregulated subsidiary in september to pursue these initiatives 
this subsidiary  mam utility services group  is providing electrical contracting  engineering  planning  procurement  and project management services to developers  generators  and others in the private and public sectors 
mam usg enjoyed successes during its first full year in business by winning bids to perform the electrical contracting work for two large wind projects as well as several other smaller commercial and industrial projects 
increasing our revenue for this segment was achieved 
total revenue for this segment was million for however  we did incur significant expense which resulted in a loss for that segment of approximately  obviously  we are disappointed any time we incur a loss and we have taken steps in several areas to help rectify this situation 
most notably  we have created templates and processes to more carefully track costs  we have hired a new general manager  we have installed an incentive based pay program within this segment  and we have also asked the mpuc for relief from corporate holding company cost allocations which we believe unfairly burden this subsidiary 
we continue to believe that a growth component of our strategy corresponds well with the stable annuity provided by the regulated utility  and offers potential upside to our shareholders 
discontinued operations as noted in prior filings  all operations of tmg  tmgc  mti  and mecel  were discontinued near the end of during the first half of  substantially all of the assets of these entities were sold and liabilities settled 
in  few transactions flowed through discontinued operations and we do not expect any material transactions during in october  public notice was posted in nova scotia  canada  for the dissolution of tmgc 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation  the currency translation adjustment accumulated in other comprehensive income oci within shareholders equity is realized upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity 
the accumulated balance totaled  for tmgc 
simply stated  this amount resulted from purchasing assets in canada when the us dollar was worth significantly more than the canadian dollar 
as the canadian dollar strengthened  when the final dissolution occurred in the fourth quarter of  those canadian investments were worth more and a gain was realized 
with the dissolution completed in the fourth quarter  mam s foreign investment in tmgc was completely liquidated  and this accumulated oci was recognized as a gain on foreign exchange from liquidation 
dividend policy as described in our annual report  we anticipated solid cash flow in  an increase in consolidated earnings for  and the related paydown of total debt 
we have achieved these goals which put the company in a position to reinstitute a common dividend 
a per share fourth quarter dividend was announced in december  signifying a return of a dividend payment which was suspended in after consecutive quarters 
as was stated in the k  dividends are subject to quarterly declaration by the board  which establishes the amount of each quarterly common stock dividend and fixes the record and payment dates 
a 
table of contents dividend would be considered for declaration to common shareholders when adequate cash flows are available and when fiscally prudent after careful consideration of all cash priorities 
although dividend payments are subject to discontinuance by our board at any time  we expect a quarterly dividend payment of at least the present amount to continue for the foreseeable future 
cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities reflect the consolidated operations of mam as the holding company  which is comprised of mps  the regulated electric transmission and distribution utility  as well as mam usg  which offers electrical contracting  engineering  planning  procurement  and project management services to developers  generators  and others in the private and public sectors 
cash flows from operations at mps will remain higher than our net income would indicate  due to the collection of previously deferred regulatory costs being collected primarily through the reason these collections do not affect our net income is that there is a regulatory mandated increase in the amortization of our regulatory stranded cost asset on our balance sheet 
these cash flows  which we call stranded cost free cash flows  will be collected through  with the majority collected during the period from january  through december  an estimated table of these net cash flows after payment of deferred taxes is listed below through in thousands of dollars 
after the majority of our stranded cost free cash flows are collected through  we will be mandated to file rate proceedings with the mpuc to determine any necessary rate adjustments 
depending on items such as our capital expenditures being included as income earning regulated assets  costs of providing our regulated services  and competitiveness of rates at the time  there may be rate changes for our customers 
cash flows provided by mam usg will depend on our ability to win construction bids  and manage our costs on projects 
while we are developing a sales pipeline of projects  we cannot predict how successful our bids to win this work will be 
we do not have a significant backlog of projects which we have already won 
other than cash for funding normal operations  the utility capital plan  and payment of dividends as mentioned above  the only other significant impact on cash flows anticipated for is contributions to our defined benefit pension plan 
mam has reduced our overall market risk as we have frozen participation as of january   and frozen any future salary and service cost accruals for participants as of december  similar to many other plans  future contributions under our plan may be more or less depending on market conditions 
as of december   approximately  had been contributed to the pension plan for plan year during  we anticipate contributing an additional  for plan year  as well as  for plan year 
table of contents consolidated capital and construction program cash expenditures for capital improvements  additions  replacements and equipment for the years ended december     and  along with estimated expenditures for are as follows in thousands of dollars unaudited estimates maine public service mam utility services group the maricor group maricor technologies  inc other subsidiaries total the significant increase in mps s projected capital expenditures that began in and continued through and into is due to the necessary improvements identified by the distribution and transmission inspection programs  which have been and will continue to be partly funded by the stranded cost free cash flows 
mps anticipates that its system will require such higher levels of capital expenditures for the next several years 
detailed analysis of changes in financial condition by operating segment regulated utility operations the following discussion includes the operations of mps and me nb net income regulated electric utility in thousands earnings per share from regulated electric utilities regulated utility operations provided or more per share in than on lower operating and interest expense 
these expense reductions more than compensated for the decrease in revenue for the segment  down approximately  due to reductions in volume 
regulated utility operating revenue consolidated revenues and megawatt hours mwh for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands of dollars dollars mwh dollars mwh residential large commercial medium commercial small commercial other retail total regulated retail other regulated operating revenue total regulated revenue 
table of contents residential customer sales were  mwh or below  the primary driver of the  decrease in residential operating revenue 
small commercial volume decreased a similar amount  down  mwh or 
these reductions in volume appear to be due to conservation efforts 
medium and large commercial customer sales are down more  reflecting the cutbacks in operations of some of our larger customers 
medium commercial volume decreased  mwh or  while large commercial volume is down  mwh or 
these decreases combined reduced revenue approximately  these reductions in volume are the continuation of the trend that began in mps revenue dollars were partly protected from these decreases in volume 
in the company s most recent stranded cost rate case   mps agreed to reconcile the projected sales volume on which the stranded cost rates were based to the actual sales volume 
with volume down significantly  mps recognized revenue and established a regulatory asset to reflect the stranded cost revenue allowed in rates 
the estimated adjustment for was  other retail revenue consists of area and street lighting 
this revenue is stable  with constant volume and a  decrease in sales dollars 
other regulatory operating revenue is up approximately  transmission wheeling revenue was up approximately  similar to the increase in over  this additional revenue will be a reduction of the transmission revenue requirement in the next oatt 
miscellaneous service revenue is down approximately  mps performed a market study of its rates for these services during  and reduced its rates to be more competitive 
smaller changes in other electric and unbilled revenue account for the remaining change 
regulated utility expenses for the years ended december  and  regulated operation and maintenance are as follows in thousands of dollars regulated operation and maintenance labor benefits outside services holding company management costs insurance regulatory and licensing transportation maintenance other total regulated operation and maintenance regulatory utility expenses are down approximately million or year over year 
the largest categories of decreases included benefits decreased  due to lower pension expense and mps labor used by the mpc project and mam usg  holding company management costs are down  due to a combination of a smaller pool of management costs and more costs allocated to mam usg  insurance expenses are general liability  property and other insurance premiums not related to employee benefits 
these insurance premiums decreased approximately  from to  
table of contents regulatory and licensing fees decreased  primarily due to lower conservation assessments with the elimination of large commercial customer volume from the calculation of this assessment  and transportation expenses decreased approximately  with mam usg absorbing some of the cost of the mps fleet including repairs and registrations 
for the years ended december  and  stranded cost amortization expenses are as follows in thousands of dollars stranded cost amortization maine yankee seabrook deferred fuel cancelled transmission plant cost incentive refund special discounts total stranded cost amortization excluding cancelled transmission plant  stranded cost amortization for through was established in mpuc docket no 
cancelled transmission plant amortization and recovery was agreed in the oatt settlement  and allowed for recovery of the cancelled transmission plant asset from rate year through rate year this asset is fully amortized as of december  for seabrook  cancelled transmission plant  the cost incentive refund and special discounts  amortization expense is recovery of cash expenditures made in the past 
the maine yankee amortization represents the cash payments to maine yankee as the decommissioning process continues to wrap up 
the deferred fuel amortization is a levelizing mechanism  and the timing of amortization and recovery of previous cash outlays for deferred fuel was negotiated in the stranded cost rate case to keep the revenue requirement constant for the rate effective period 
unregulated utility services the unregulated utility services segment is composed of the results of mam usg 
mam usg s first full year of operation was  with the company created in september revenue direct expenses gross profit other expenses common corporate costs and facilities charges income tax benefit net loss unregulated utility services loss per share from unregulated utility services mam usg secured two large wind development projects during  generating the majority of the segment s million operating revenue  yielding an approximately gross margin 
management has taken steps to improve the bidding and cost control processes more effectively going forward 
we have also hired a new general manager  and installed an incentive based pay program for mam usg 
finally  we have asked the 
table of contents mpuc under docket no 
for relief from the corporate holding company cost allocations we believe unfairly burden this subsidiary 
while we cannot guarantee improved performance going forward  we are optimistic about the impact the combination of these changes could have on the segment results 
other continuing operations other continuing operations includes the activity of mam  the holding company  such as the unregulated costs of the holding company that cannot be allocated as common costs  and intercompany eliminations 
net loss other in thousands loss per share from other continuing operations the expenses in included an adjustment to the estimated tax provision from the filing of the income tax return  one third of the oracle hosting arrangement expenses  which cannot be charged to mps  and the remaining costs associated with dissolving tmg

under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation  the currency translation adjustment accumulated in oci within shareholders equity is realized upon complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity 
the accumulated balance totaled  for tmgc 
this amount resulted from purchasing assets in canada when the us dollar was worth significantly more than the canadian dollar 
as the canadian dollar strengthened  when the final dissolution occurred in the fourth quarter of  those canadian investments were worth more and a gain was realized 
with the dissolution completed in the fourth quarter  mam s foreign investment in tmgc was completely liquidated  and this accumulated oci was recognized as a gain on foreign exchange from liquidation

taxes other than income taxes other than income consist of property and payroll taxes 
these expenses remained constant from year to year  at approximately million in each and income tax expense benefit regulated income tax expenses were approximately million for  compared to million for the higher earnings for the segment were partly offset by the reduced effective income tax rate  as a result of an adjustment to the prior year income tax estimates 
the benefit from unregulated income taxes was  for  compared to  for an adjustment to the estimated tax provision from the filing of the income tax return reduced the income tax benefit at mam 
during the stranded cost free cash flow period  the deferred income tax liabilities are reversing and realized as current income tax obligations 
the remaining net operating loss carryforward from the operations and dissolutions of tmg and mti was used to offset these cash obligations during interest charges interest expense decreased  from million in to million in in addition to regular repayments of debt  mps made its final payment on its fame note  and mam repaid in full its bank of america term note during further  interest rates on the variable rate debt issues were lower in than the reduction in interest expense from stranded cost carrying charges decreased from million in to million in as the regulatory assets are recovered during the stranded cost free cash flow period  the stranded cost carrying charges will continue to decrease 
critical accounting policies regulatory assets and liabilities pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  the company capitalizes  as regulatory assets  incurred and accrued costs that 
table of contents are probable of recovery in future electric rates 
it also records  as regulatory liabilities  obligations to refund previously collected revenue or to spend revenue collected from customers on future costs 
unfunded future income taxes and deferred income taxes are amortized as the related temporary differences reverse 
unamortized loss on debt retirements is amortized over the lives of the related debt issues 
nuclear plant obligations  deferred fuel costs  other regulatory assets and other regulatory liabilities are amortized over various periods in accordance with mps s current rate plans 
mps earns a return on substantially all regulatory assets for which funds have been spent 
the company believes that mps s electric transmission and distribution operations continue to meet the requirements of sfas  and that regulatory assets associated with those operations  as well as any generation related costs that the mpuc has determined to be recoverable from ratepayers  also meet the criteria 
if the company were to cease meeting the criteria for application of these accounting rules  the accounting standards for businesses in general would become applicable  and immediate recognition of any previously deferred costs  or a portion of deferred costs  would be required in the year in which the criteria are no longer met 
at december   million of regulatory assets remained on mps s books 
these assets will be amortized over various periods in accordance with mpuc approved rate orders 
revenue recognition mps mps is a regulated utility  operating its distribution activity under the jurisdiction of the maine public utilities commission and transmission activity under the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission

transmission rates are adjusted annually  and were most recently changed on july  the final settlement of transmission rates is not yet complete  and may result in an adjustment during distribution and stranded cost rates did not change during in  mps anticipates the annual adjustments to its transmission rates on july   and a rate filing for stranded cost rates to be effective january  the change in any rates could have a positive or negative impact on earnings and cash flow  but the ultimate impact is unknown at this time 
no adjustments to distribution rates are currently anticipated to occur in mps records an estimate for electricity delivered  but not yet billed to customers 
this estimate requires mps to make certain assumptions 
a change in those assumptions could cause the amounts reported as revenues to change 
in july  mps began recording the difference between the approved tariff rate for two large industrial customers and their current special discount rates  under contracts approved by the mpuc  as accrued revenue 
the resulting deferred asset will be subsequently collected in rates as approved by the mpuc 
during and   was recognized as stranded costs associated with these two contracts

revenue recognition mam usg revenues and profits from mam usg s long term contracts are recognized on a percentage completed basis for the period 
costs incurred to date are divided by total estimated costs to obtain the percentage completed 
this percentage multiplied by the total estimated profit is the gross profit earned to date on the contract 
gross profit earned to date on the contract plus costs incurred to date on the contract equals revenues 
table of contents recognized to date 
revenue recognized to date compared to billings to date resulted in either under or over billings 
losses on contracts will be recognized in full if there is evidence that an overall loss will be sustained 
the provision is computed on the basis of the total estimated cost to complete the contract and reflects all elements of costs included in contract costs 
costs incurred on approved change orders are treated as job costs for that particular job 
costs incurred on unapproved change orders are treated as costs in the period in which they are incurred if it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
if it is probable that the cost will be recovered through a change in the contract price  the costs are deferred until there is an agreed upon change in the contract price 
in accordance with normal practice in the construction industry  mam usg will include in current assets and current liabilities amounts related to construction contracts realizable and payable over a period in excess of one year 
deferred contract revenue represented the excess of billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method on certain contracts 
unbilled contract revenue represented the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date on the percentage of completion accounting method over billings to date on the remaining contracts 
unbilled contract revenue resulted when the appropriate contract revenue amount had been recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion accounting method  but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract and or costs  recorded at estimated realizable value  related to unapproved change orders or claims incurred 
consistent with industry practice  certain of mam usg s customers withhold a portion of the payment of each invoice as retainage until the project is completed to specifications 
similarly  mam usg withholds a portion of the payments to certain subcontractors 
mam usg had  of retainage receivable reported within accounts receivable and  of retainage payable reported with accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
these amounts are expected to be received and paid within one year  and are therefore classified as current assets and liabilities
