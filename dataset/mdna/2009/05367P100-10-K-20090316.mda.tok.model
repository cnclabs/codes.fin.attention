we initiated a significant transformation of our business that included  among other things  establishing a new management team  developing a new corporate strategy  restructuring our internal organization  improving operational efficiencies  divesting non core product lines and reducing the size of our workforce 
we have established a strategic and organizational foundation from which we are positioned to build momentum in our core business and expand our operating margins with the ultimate goal of sustainable growth 
we have traditionally operated our company as three business units  professional video  audio and consumer video  with each corresponding to a reportable segment 
as part of our transformation  we transitioned to a new business unit and reporting model on january  this new model  which includes a single customer facing organization  better aligns us with the realities of many of our customers who either depend on  or would benefit from  an integrated solution that encompasses multiple avid product and brand families 
it also enables us to leverage our deep domain expertise  brand recognition and technology synergies across customer market segments 
although this transition represents a significant change to the way we operate our business  because we did not fully implement it until the beginning of  we are reporting our financial results in this annual report with reference to our three traditional reportable segments to reflect the way we operated in our full assessment of the reporting model to be used starting in is not yet complete 
financial summary the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  product revenues services revenues total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill and intangible assets restructuring costs  net in process research and development gain on sale of assets total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss total net revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  compared to  professional video revenues decreased  audio revenues decreased and consumer video revenues decreased 
the revenues of each business unit are discussed in further detail in the section titled results of operations below 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million for the net loss for includes charges of million for impairment of acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets  million of acquisition related costs for intangible asset amortization expenses and million of restructuring costs 
the net loss for includes million of acquisition related intangible amortization costs and million of restructuring costs 
the increases in impairment and restructuring costs in were partially offset by gains totaling million related to product line divestitures 
the charges of million for impairment of acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets was composed of goodwill impairment losses of million and million for our consumer video and audio segments  respectively  and impairment losses for consumer video intangible assets of million 
see note g to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding our impairment losses 
in november  we sold our softimage d animation product line  which was part of our professional video segment  to autodesk  inc we received million of the million dollar purchase price in the fourth quarter of  with the remaining balance to be held in escrow with scheduled distribution dates in and we recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction  which does not include the proceeds held in escrow 
this product line accounted for approximately million of our revenues 
in december  we sold our pctv product line  which was part of our consumer video segment  to hauppauge computer works  inc for total proceeds of approximately million  which included million in cash and a note valued at million 
we recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
pctv inventory valued at million was classified as held for sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we will be reimbursed for the cost of any pctv inventory sold by the buyer and expect the inventory to be sold during the next twelve months 
the pctv product line accounted for approximately million of our revenues 
during  we initiated restructuring plans that included reductions in force of approximately positions  including employees related to our divested product lines  and the closure of five small facilities 
the restructuring plan is intended to improve operational efficiencies 
in connection with these plans  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to employee termination costs and million for the facilities closures 
in addition  as a result of our decision to divest our pctv product line  we recorded a non cash restructuring charge of million in cost of revenues related to the write down of inventory 
we expect annual cost savings of approximately million to result from actions taken under these restructuring plans 
during the first quarter of  we used million in cash to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
no additional shares of our common stock were repurchased during the remainder of at december   we had authorization from our board of directors for additional repurchases of up to million 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenues from sales to customers outside the united states 
international sales accounted for of our consolidated net revenues in  compared to and of our consolidated net revenues for and  respectively 
our international business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the customers 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect  either positively or adversely  our revenues  net income and cash flow 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term  and we plan our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenues 
in addition  a significant percentage of our sales transactions are completed during the final weeks or days of each quarter  and  therefore  we generally do not know whether revenues have met our expectations until after the end of the quarter 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter  there is an immediate effect on our overall earnings 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report for additional risk factors that may cause our future results to differ materially from our current expectations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges  stock based compensation  allowances for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions  the valuation of inventories  business combinations  and goodwill and other intangible assets  divestitures  fair value measurements  and income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we generally recognize revenues from sales of software and software related products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable and all other revenue recognition criteria of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended  are met 
we often receive multiple purchase orders or contracts from a single customer or a group of related parties that are evaluated to determine if they are  in effect  parts of a single arrangement 
if they are determined to be parts of a single arrangement  revenues are recorded as if a single multiple element arrangement exists 
in addition  for certain transactions where our services are non routine or essential to the delivered products  we record revenues upon satisfying the criteria of sop and obtaining customer acceptance 
within our professional video segment  our consumer video segment and much of our audio segment  we follow the guidance of sop for revenue recognition because our products and services are software or software related 
however  for certain offerings in our audio segment  software is incidental to the delivered products and services 
for these products  we record revenues based on satisfying the criteria in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in connection with many of our product sale transactions  customers may purchase a maintenance and support agreement 
we recognize revenues from maintenance contracts on a ratable basis over their term 
we recognize revenues from training  installation or other services as the services are performed 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element  typically professional services or maintenance  is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenues related to the delivered element 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and only recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is typically based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
however  in certain transactions  fair value of maintenance is based on the renewal price that is offered as a contractual right to the customer  provided that the renewal price is substantive 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type  purchase volume  term and customer location 
we review services revenues sold separately and corresponding renewal rates on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  the fair value for services used for revenue recognition purposes to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
in most cases  the products we sell do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires minimal effort and is not typically performed by us 
however  certain transactions for our professional video products  typically complex solution sales that include a significant number of products and that may involve multiple customer sites  require us to perform an installation effort that we deem to be complex and non routine 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenues for either the products shipped or the installation services until the installation is complete 
in addition  if these orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenues are recognized until the customer s acceptance of the products and services has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
technical support  enhancements and unspecified upgrades typically are provided at no additional charge during the product s initial warranty period generally between days and twelve months  which precedes commencement of the maintenance contracts 
we defer the fair value of this support period and recognize the related revenues ratably over the initial warranty period 
we also from time to time offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for each of these elements that is undelivered at the time of product shipment  and provided that we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered element  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize those revenues only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the upgrade have been satisfied 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
within our professional video segment  our resellers and distributors are generally not granted rights to return products to us after purchase  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
however  distributors of our media composer software and avid mojo products have a contractual right to return a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the return provision for these distributors has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
in contrast  certain of our audio and consumer video channel partners are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation and price protection 
in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances as a reduction of revenues in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making these estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions and other known factors 
the amount and timing of our revenues for any period may be affected if actual product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from our estimates 
a portion of our revenues from sales of consumer products is derived from transactions with channel partners who have unlimited return rights and from whom payment is contingent upon the product being sold through to their customers 
accordingly  revenues for these channel partners is recognized when the products are sold through to the customer instead of being recognized at the time products are shipped to the channel partners 
from time to time  we offer rebates on purchases of certain products or based on purchasing volume that are accounted for as reductions to revenues upon shipment or expected achievement of purchasing volumes 
in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  consideration given to customers or resellers under the rebate program is recorded as a reduction to revenues because we do not receive an identifiable benefit that is sufficiently separable from the sale of our products 
at the time of a sales transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenues are recognized only if it is probable that collection will occur in a timely manner 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not probable based on our credit review process  revenues are recognized on a cash collected basis to the extent that the other criteria of sop and sab no 
are satisfied 
at the outset of the arrangement  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally days  but can be up to days  after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is successful  then revenues are recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
we record as revenues all amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs and record the actual shipping costs as a component of cost of revenues 
we record reimbursements received from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenues  with related costs recorded as cost of revenues 
we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to a government authority 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas no 
revised  or sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
during and  we granted both restricted stock units and stock options as part of our key performer stock based compensation program  as well as stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock to newly hired employees 
the vesting of stock option grants may be based on time  performance or market conditions 
in the future  we may grant stock awards  options  or other equity based instruments allowed by our stock based compensation plans  or a combination thereof  as part of our overall compensation strategy 
the fair values of restricted stock awards with time based vesting  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are generally based on the intrinsic values of the awards at the date of grant 
as permitted under sfas no 
and sfas r  we generally use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on recent six month trailing implied volatility calculations 
these calculations are performed on exchange traded options of our common stock 
we believe that using a forward looking market driven volatility assumption will result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the assumed expected life is based on company specific historical experience 
with regard to the estimate of the expected life  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
we estimate forfeiture rates at the time awards are made based on historical turnover rates and apply these rates in the calculation of estimated compensation cost 
for all stock based awards for the year ended december  and for most stock based awards for the year ended december   we applied a estimated forfeiture rate 
we review historical turnover rates quarterly and update estimated forfeiture rates to be applied to employee classes for the calculation of stock based compensation 
in  based on historical turnover rates  we segregated our non employee directors into a separate class  and in  we determined that the executive management staff should be segregated from the rest of our employees into a separate class for the calculation of stock based compensation 
as of december   our annualized estimated forfeiture rates were for non employee director awards  for executive management staff and for all other employee awards 
then current revised forfeiture rates are also applied quarterly to all outstanding stock options and non vested restricted stock awards  which may result in a revised estimate of compensation costs related to these stock based grants 
as a result of the application of the changes in forfeiture rates in  we recorded in our results of operations cumulative adjustments that reduced previously recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
in december  we granted a stock option to purchase  shares of our common stock to our chief executive officer that has vesting based on market conditions or a combination of performance and market conditions 
during  we issued to executives additional stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock and  restricted stock units  which also have vesting based on market conditions or a combination of performance and market conditions 
the compensation costs and derived service periods for all grants with vesting based on market conditions or a combination of performance and market conditions were estimated using the monte carlo valuation method 
for stock option grants with vesting based on a combination of performance and market conditions  the compensation costs were also estimated using the black scholes valuation method 
for restricted stock grants with vesting based on a combination of performance and market conditions  the compensation costs were also estimated using the intrinsic value on the date of grant factored for probability 
compensation costs for these stock option and restricted stock unit grants were recorded based on the higher estimate for each vesting tranche 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and monte carlo models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
see note b to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding stock based compensation 
allowance for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions we maintain allowances for estimated bad debt losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for products or services 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances  we analyze accounts receivable balances  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we provide third party lease financing options to some of our customers 
we are not generally a party to the leases  however  during the terms of these leases  which are generally three years  we may remain liable for any unpaid principal balance upon default by the customer  but such liability is limited in the aggregate 
we record revenues from these transactions upon the shipment of our products because we believe that our collection experience with similar transactions supports our assessment that the fee is fixed or determinable 
we have operated a financing program for over ten years and to date defaults under the program have consistently ranged between and 
we maintain reserves for estimated recourse losses under this financing program based on these historical default rates 
see note j to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding third party lease financing 
inventories our inventory is subject to rapid technological change or obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down inventory to its realizable value to reflect estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability based on assumptions about future inventory demand generally for the following twelve months and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets  including intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or component thereof will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value and other similar circumstances 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
our organizational structure in  and was based on three strategic business units professional video  audio and consumer video  which equated to our reporting units 
all three of the reporting units include goodwill 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment tests as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
in our goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we generally use a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine the fair values of our reporting units 
this model focuses on estimates of future revenues and profits for each reporting unit and also assumes a terminal value for the unit based on a constant growth valuation formula 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
the model also includes assumptions for  among others  working capital cash flow  growth rates  income tax rates  expected tax benefits and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
we estimate the long term discount rates based on our review of the weighted average cost of capital and appropriate equity risk premium for each reporting unit 
we also consider comparable market data based on multiples of revenue as well as the reconciliation of our market capitalization to the total fair value of our reporting units 
if a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
in the fourth quarter of each year  we also complete our annual budget for the upcoming year 
in the fourth quarter of due to the significant decline in our stock price  increased uncertainty of future revenue levels due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and the divestiture of our pctv product line  our impairment testing determined that the carrying values of our audio and consumer video reporting units exceeded their fair values 
these fair values were then allocated among the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the respective reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill 
we estimated the fair values of the intangible assets using various valuation models based on different approaches  including the multi period excess cash flows approach  royalty savings approach and avoided cost approach 
these approaches include assumptions for  among others  customer retention rates  trademark royalty rates  costs to complete in process technology and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
because the book values of the audio goodwill and consumer video goodwill exceeded their implied fair values by million and million  respectively  we recorded these amounts as impairment losses during the fourth quarter of the use of different assumptions in our valuation models could result in additional impairment charges and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
similarly  in the fourth quarter of  our impairment testing determined that the carrying value of our consumer video reporting unit exceeded its implied fair value by million  and this amount was recorded as an impairment loss 
goodwill is also tested for impairment if events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
in september  as a result of a decrease in market value for  and the expected sale of  our pctv product line  which historically accounted for a significant portion of consumer video revenues  we tested the goodwill assigned to the consumer video segment for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
an estimate of the fair value of the consumer video reporting unit was calculated using a discounted cash flow valuation model similar to that used in valuing the acquisition of pinnacle and updated for then current revenue projections 
the fair value was then allocated among the consumer video tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill 
because the book value of the consumer video goodwill exceeded the implied fair value by million  we recorded this amount as an impairment loss during the third quarter of identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  if events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value  and if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in connection with the goodwill impairment losses taken for the audio and consumer video reporting units in the fourth quarter of  we also reviewed the audio and consumer video identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment 
this analysis included grouping the intangible assets with other operating assets and liabilities in the consumer video reporting unit that would not otherwise be subject to impairment testing  because the grouped assets and liabilities represent the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities within our company 
the result of this analysis determined that consumer video customer relationships and trade name intangible assets were impaired  and we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively 
the analysis for the audio reporting unit determined that no impairment existed for that reporting unit s identifiable intangible assets 
similarly  in september as a result of a decrease in market value for  and the expected sale of  our pctv product line  we tested the consumer video identifiable intangible assets for impairment 
the impairment tests determined that the trade name intangible asset was impaired  and we recorded an impairment loss of million to write this asset down to its then current fair value 
in connection with the goodwill impairment loss taken for the consumer video reporting unit in  we also reviewed the consumer video identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment 
the result of this analysis was that the undiscounted cash flows of the consumer video net asset groups exceeded the carrying value  indicating no impairment loss had occurred 
divestitures in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we classify the assets and liabilities of a business as held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan of sale and it is probable that the sale will be completed 
the carrying value of the net assets of the business held for sale are then recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair market value  less costs to sell  and we cease to record depreciation and amortization expense associated with assets held for sale 
as discussed in note g to our consolidated financial statements in item  we completed the sales of the softimage d animation and pctv product lines in the fourth quarter of pctv inventory valued at million was classified as held for sale and included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  when we measure the gain loss on sale of a disposal group that is part of a reporting unit  we determine whether a portion of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the disposal group if it constitutes a business  under the guidance of eitf issue  determining whether a nonmonetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
if the disposal group is considered a business  the goodwill of the reporting unit is allocated based on the relative fair values of the disposal group and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the softimage d animation product line constituted a business  therefore  the gain on sale of this business includes an allocation of million of goodwill from the professional video reporting unit 
even though it was determined that the softimage d animation product line constituted a business  we concluded that this business did not represent a component of our company that would require the presentation of the divestiture as a discontinued operation 
we made this determination based on the fact that the softimage product line does not have operations or cash flows that are clearly distinguishable and largely independent from the rest of the professional video reporting unit 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the pctv product line was not a business and  therefore  should not be reported as a discontinued operation based on the fact that the asset group sold would not be able to continue to conduct normal  self sustaining operations 
fair value measurements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but its provisions apply to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement 
sfas no 
was effective for our fiscal year beginning january  and for interim periods within that year 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delayed for one year the effective date of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
as required  we adopted sfas no 
for our financial assets on january  adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in accordance with fsp no 
 we deferred the application of the provisions of sfas no 
to certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including reporting units measured at fair value in goodwill impairment tests  nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value for impairment assessments and nonfinancial liabilities for restructuring activities 
the adoption of sfas no 
 as it pertains to non financial assets and liabilities  is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires the use of observable market data  when available  and prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value in the following categories level quoted unadjusted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model derived valuations in which all observable inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level model derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable  including assumptions developed by us 
on a recurring basis  we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  including our cash equivalents and investment instruments 
all of our cash equivalents and investment instruments are classified as either level or level in the fair value hierarchy as of december  instruments valued using quoted market prices in active markets and classified as level are primarily money market securities 
investments valued based on other observable inputs and classified as level include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  asset backed obligations  discount notes  and corporate and agency bonds 
our foreign currency contracts are executed in the over the counter retail market with multi national banks and have a relatively high level of price transparency 
the valuation inputs for these instruments are based on quoted prices in active markets  and these instruments are classified as level the valuation techniques used to determine fair values of our investment instruments are as follows money market the fair value of our money market fund investment is determined using the unadjusted quoted price from an active market of identical assets 
commercial paper and certificates of deposit the fair values for our commercial paper holdings and certificates of deposit are derived from a pricing model  using the straight line amortized cost method  and incorporating observable inputs including maturity date  issue date  credit rating of the issuer  current commercial paper rate and settlement date 
corporate bonds the determination of the fair value of corporate bonds includes the use of observable inputs from market sources and incorporating relative credit information  observed market movements and sector news into a pricing model 
asset backed obligations the fair value of asset backed obligations is determined using a pricing methodology based on observable market inputs including an analysis of pricing  spread and volatility of similar asset backed obligations 
using the market inputs  cash flows are generated for each tranche  the benchmark yield is determined and deal collateral performance and other market information is incorporated to determine the appropriate spreads 
agency bonds discount notes the fair value of agency bonds and discount note investments is determined using observable market inputs for benchmark yields  base spreads  yield to maturity and relevant trade data 
income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes compared to the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability with consideration for such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on our level of deferred tax assets as of december  and our level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets could change in the future based on our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
reversal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of reversal 
if the valuation allowance of million as of december  were to be removed in its entirety  a million non cash reduction in income tax expense would be recorded 
however  upon our adoption of sfas no 
revised  or sfas r  business combinations  on january   changes in valuation allowances related to acquisitions will affect income tax expense 
to the extent some or all of our valuation allowance is reversed  future financial statements would reflect an increase in non cash income tax expense until such time as our deferred tax assets are fully utilized 
for and  there was no impact to goodwill from the utilization of acquired us deferred tax assets 
for  the impact to goodwill resulting from the utilization of acquired us deferred tax assets was million 
in addition to the tax assets described above  we have deferred tax assets resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas r  recognition of these assets would occur upon their utilization to reduce taxes payable and would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity rather than the provision for income taxes 
as a result of the exercise of employee stock options  we recorded an increase to additional paid in capital of million in in  we recorded a decrease of million to additional paid in capital as a cumulative catch up for prior year amounts recorded in excess of the final deductions reflected on our tax returns 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statement in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires that a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained before being recognized in the financial statements 
the interpretation also requires us to accrue interest and penalties as applicable on our unrecognized tax positions 
we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of the adoption of fin as of december  and  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of million and million  respectively 
as of december   million represented the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would have resulted in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
however  upon our adoption of sfas r on january   changes in unrecognized tax benefits related to acquisitions  including any changes associated with acquisitions that occurred prior to adoption  will generally affect income tax expense

we believe unfavorable macroeconomic conditions contributed significantly to the overall decrease in professional video product revenues in in addition  the decrease in video editing revenues was the result of both the slowdown in sales in early in anticipation of our new editor product set  which was released in june  and the price reductions for our video editors announced in the first quarter of the effect of the price reductions was partially offset by higher unit volume sales for these products 
the timing of customer acceptance and revenue recognition was also a contributing factor for the decrease in revenues from large broadcast deals in professional video services revenues are derived primarily from maintenance contracts  professional and installation services  and training 
the increase in services revenues in was due to increased revenues generated from maintenance contracts sold in connection with our products  as well as increased revenues from professional and installation services 
maintenance revenues increased starting in the second quarter of due to an increase in new large deals that included maintenance contracts 
the decrease in audio product revenues in was primarily the result of decreased revenues from our home studio products  as well as a slowdown in sales of our professional integrated mixing console products 
the decrease in revenues from our home studio products was due to increased competitive pressure and the lingering effects of temporary delays in the release of products compatible with a new version of the mac os x leopard operating system 
products compatible with the new operating system were released late in the second quarter of we believe unfavorable macroeconomic conditions also contributed to the decrease in revenues for our home studio products and was the most significant factor in the slowdown in sales of our professional integrated mixing console products 
the decrease in consumer video product revenues in was primarily the result of decreased revenues from our pctv products  largely due to changes in product mix  and lower overall consumer video revenues in the fourth quarter of the divestiture of our pctv product line during the fourth quarter of caused a disruption in our consumer video distribution channels that not only affected revenues for our pctv product line but for our video editing products as well 
unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and a downturn in traditional holiday sales also negatively affected our consumer video revenues

the decrease in revenues for our broadcast products was related to our transmission server product line 
as part of our restructuring programs  we made a decision to exit this product line 
the overall decrease in professional video product revenues for was partially mitigated by increased revenues from our storage and workgroups product families 
professional video services revenues are derived primarily from maintenance contracts  professional and installation services  and training 
the increase in services revenues in was due to increased revenues from maintenance contracts 
the increase in audio product revenues in was primarily the result of revenues of million related to our acquisition of sibelius in july audio product revenues for also included increased revenues from digidesign products  including the venue live sound mixing consoles  pro tools systems  and icon control surfaces  partially offset by a slight decrease in m audio product revenues 
the overall increase in audio segment product revenues was primarily the result of increased sales volumes 
the decrease in consumer video product revenues in was primarily due to decreased revenues from our pctv product line  due to the lack of revenue drivers in that existed in  such as new product releases and increased consumer demand during the world cup tournament

these negative influences on gross margin were partially offset by a shift in product mix to increased revenues from higher margin software products and increased sales volumes 
during  a few large professional video broadcast installations had gross margins that were lower than our usual margin for broadcast transactions of similar size  due in part to the inclusion of a high percentage of lower margin third party products 
these transactions had a negative effect on our professional video product gross margins for in our consumer video segment  we discontinued a pctv product sold exclusively to an original equipment manufacturer  which resulted in a write off of million in inventory and had a negative impact on the consumer video segment s gross margins 
the slight decrease in the services gross margin for primarily reflected a increase in services costs and expenses  including a million increase in services personnel costs and a million increase in facilities costs  and an increase of for the corresponding services revenues

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets result from acquisitions and include developed technology  customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
with the exception of developed technology  these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
developed technology is amortized over the greater of the amount calculated using the ratio of current quarter revenues to the total of current quarter and anticipated future revenues over the estimated useful life of the developed technology  and the straight line method over each developed technology s remaining useful life 
amortization of developed technology is recorded within cost of revenues

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of due to the significant decline in our stock price  increased uncertainty of future revenue levels due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and the divestiture of our pctv product line  our annual testing determined that the carrying values of the audio and consumer video reporting units exceeded their fair values  indicating possible goodwill impairments for these reporting units 
the fair values of these reporting units were then allocated among their respective tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill 
because the book values of the audio goodwill and consumer video goodwill exceeded their implied fair values by approximately million and million  respectively  we recorded these amounts as impairment losses during the quarter ended december  goodwill is also tested for impairment when events and circumstances occur that indicate that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
in september  as a result of a decrease in market value for  and the expected sale of  our pctv product line  which have historically accounted for a significant portion of consumer video segment revenues  we tested the goodwill assigned to our consumer video reporting unit for impairment 
because the book value of the consumer video goodwill exceeded the implied fair value by million  we recorded this amount as an impairment loss during the quarter ended september  in connection with the goodwill impairment loss taken for the audio and consumer video reporting units in the fourth quarter of  we also reviewed the audio and consumer video identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
this analysis included grouping the intangible assets with other operating assets and liabilities in the consumer video reporting unit that would not otherwise be subject to impairment testing because the grouped assets and liabilities represent the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities within our company 
the result of this analysis determined that the consumer video customer relationships and trade name intangible assets were impaired  and we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  to write these assets down to their then current fair values 
the analysis for the audio reporting unit determined that no impairment existed for that reporting unit s identifiable intangible assets 
in connection with the goodwill impairment loss taken for the consumer video reporting unit in the third quarter of  we also tested the consumer video identifiable intangible assets for impairment 
as a result  we determined that the trade name intangible asset was impaired  and we recorded an impairment loss of million to write this asset down to its then current fair value 
in  our annual goodwill impairment testing determined that the carrying value of the consumer video reporting goodwill exceeded its implied fair value 
because the book value of the consumer video goodwill exceeded the implied fair value by million  we recorded this amount as an impairment loss during the quarter ended december  see note g to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding our and impairment losses 
restructuring costs  net in october  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan that included a reduction in force of approximately positions  including employees associated with two divestitures completed in the fourth quarter  and the closure of three small facilities 
the restructuring plan is intended to improve operational efficiencies 
in connection with this plan  during the fourth quarter we recorded restructuring charges of million related to employee termination costs and million for the facilities closures 
in addition  as a result of our decision to sell our pctv product line  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in cost of revenues related to the write down of inventory 
of the total restructuring charge of million  million related to our consumer video segment  million related to our professional video segment  million related to our audio segment and million related to our corporate operations 
we expect annual cost savings of approximately million to result from actions taken under this restructuring plan 
additionally  during the first quarter of  we initiated restructuring plans within our professional video business unit and corporate operations to eliminate duplicative business functions and improve operational efficiencies 
during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million under these plans related to employee termination costs for employees  primarily in the marketing and selling teams and general and administrative teams 
during the second quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million under these plans primarily related to employee termination costs for employees  primarily in the research and development teams and sales and marketing teams 
during the third quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million under these plans primarily related to employee termination costs for employees  primarily in the research and development teams and general and administrative teams 
we expect annual cost savings of approximately million to result from actions taken under these restructuring plans 
also during  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million for revised estimates of previously initiated restructuring plans 
during  we implemented restructuring programs within our professional video and consumer video business units  as well as corporate operations  resulting in restructuring charges of million  million and million  respectively 
in connection with these actions  we notified approximately employees that their employment would be terminated 
the terminated employees were primarily from the research and development teams and marketing and selling teams 
the charges for the estimated costs for the employee terminations totaled million 
actions under these restructuring programs also included the closure of facilities in munich  germany and chicago  illinois and portions of facilities in tewksbury  massachusetts  montreal  canada  and mountain view  california  and our exit from the transmission server product line 
the costs for the facility closures totaled million 
as a result of exiting the transmission server product line  we recorded non cash charges totaling million in cost of revenues for the write down of inventory 
we also recorded a non cash restructuring charge of million related to the disposal of fixed assets 
the purpose of these restructuring programs was to eliminate duplicative business functions  improve operational efficiencies and align key business skill sets with future opportunities 
during  we also recorded restructuring charges totaling million and million  respectively  as a result of our increased estimates for the facilities restructuring costs related to our pinnacle and medea acquisitions  and million primarily as a result of our increased estimate for the restructuring costs associated with the vacated portion of our montreal facility that was part of a restructuring that took place in december the revised estimate related to the pinnacle acquisition was primarily the result of an increase in the estimated costs for the closure of pinnacle s uxbridge  uk facility based on our conclusion that we will be unable to find a subtenant at any time during the remaining term of our lease for that facility 
the revised estimate related to the montreal facility was primarily the result of a buy out of the lease for the vacated portion of the facility 
during  we implemented restructuring programs within both our professional video and consumer video segments  resulting in restructuring charges of million and million  respectively 
as a result of these restructuring programs  approximately employees worldwide  primarily in the management  selling and research and development teams  were notified that their employment would be terminated  and a small leased office in australia and a portion of a facility in germany were closed 
the estimated costs for the employee terminations were million and the costs for the facility closures were million 
the purpose of these programs was to improve the effectiveness of each segment 
during the first and second quarters of  we recorded in our statement of operations additional restructuring charges totaling million for revisions to the estimated liabilities for the professional video restructuring program 
also during  we executed an amendment to the existing lease for our daly city  california facility that extended the lease through september  and a new subtenant was found for a portion of our london  uk facility vacated as part of a restructuring program 
based on the new terms of the amended lease for the daly city facility and our changing facilities requirements  we determined that we would re occupy the space in this facility that had previously been vacated under a restructuring program 
accordingly  the existing restructuring accrual for that facility was reversed during the third quarter of  and a restructuring recovery of million was recorded in our statement of operations 
as a result of finding a subtenant for the london facility  a restructuring recovery of million was recorded in our statement of operations during the fourth quarter of in process research and development we recorded in process r d charges of million and million in related to the acquisitions of sibelius and medea  respectively 
these in process r d charges represent product development efforts that were under way at sibelius and medea at the time of the respective acquisitions for which technological feasibility had not yet been established 
technological feasibility is established when either of the following criteria is met detailed program design has been completed  documented and traced to product specifications and its high risk development issues have been resolved  or a working model of the product has been finished and determined to be complete and consistent with the product design 
as of the respective acquisition dates  sibelius and medea had not completed product designs or working models for the in process technologies  and we determined that there was no future alternative use for the technologies beyond the stated purpose of the specific r d projects 
the fair value of each in process r d effort was  therefore  expensed at the time of the respective acquisitions 
the key assumptions used in the in process r d valuations consisted of the expected completion dates for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenues and expense projections assuming future release of the products  and a risk adjusted discount rate 
the discount rate is based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks such as delays or uncertainties in bringing the products to market and competitive pressures 
such risks vary from acquisition to acquisition based on the characteristics of the acquired company and the applications of the acquired technology 
projections of revenues and expenses  the estimated costs to complete the projects and the determination of the appropriate discount rate reflect management s best estimates of these factors at the time of the valuation 
for purposes of valuing the in process r d of sibelius and medea  we used discount rates of and  respectively 
gain on sale of assets in the fourth quarter of  we sold our softimage d animation product line  which was part of our professional video segment  and our pctv product line  which was part of our consumer video segment 
the softimage product line was sold to autodesk  inc  and million of the million dollar purchase price was received in the fourth quarter of  with the remaining balance to be held in escrow with scheduled distribution dates in and in  we recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction  which does not include the proceeds held in escrow 
the pctv product line was sold to hauppauge computer works  inc for total proceeds of approximately million  which included million in cash and a note valued at million 
we recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
pctv inventory valued at million was classified as held for sale in accordance with sfas  no 
and included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we will be reimbursed for the cost of any pctv inventory sold by the buyer and expect the inventory to be sold during the next twelve months 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  generally consists of interest income  interest expense and equity in income of a non consolidated company 
comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands change change interest and other income expense  net as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in interest and other income  net  for was primarily due to decreased interest income earned due to decreased rates of return on cash and marketable securities balances  as well as decreased average cash and marketable securities balances resulting from our stock repurchases in early comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands change change interest and other income expense  net as a percentage of net revenues the increase in interest and other income  net  for was primarily due to increased interest income earned due to increased rates of return on cash and marketable securities balances 
provision for income taxes  net comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands change provision for income taxes  net as a percentage of net revenues comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands change provision for income taxes  net as a percentage of net revenues the net tax provision of million for reflected a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax benefit of million mostly related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets  as well as the write down of deferred tax liabilities due to goodwill and intangible asset impairments 
the net tax provision of million for reflected a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax benefit of million mostly related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets and to a release of a deferred tax liability in our german entity 
the net tax provision of million for reflected a current tax provision of million and a non cash deferred tax charge of million related to the utilization of acquired net operating loss carryforwards and other acquired timing differences  partially offset by a million deferred tax benefit related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets 
our effective tax rate  which represents our tax provision as a percentage of profit or loss before tax  was  and  respectively  for  and compared to  the provision for income taxes decreased slightly in  while the effective tax rate decreased significantly as a result of the large net loss in  primarily due to goodwill impairments 
the provision for taxes was reduced by discrete tax benefits of million resulting from the write down of deferred tax liabilities due to goodwill and intangible asset impairments and an expected million benefit from a provision of the housing and economic recovery act of that allows for the utilization of unused r d tax credits 
the decrease in the provision for income taxes in  compared to  resulted primarily from a discrete tax benefit of million resulting from the favorable settlement of a canadian r d credit audit  a discrete tax benefit of million resulting from the release of a deferred tax liability in our german entity  and our inability to recognize a tax benefit on us losses 
we generally recognize no significant us tax benefit from acquisition related amortization 
except for a minimal amount of state tax payments  the federal and state tax provisions are non cash provisions due to the tax impact of net operating loss carryforwards related to stock option deductions and acquisition related net operating loss carryforwards 
the tax rate in each year is affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december  and the level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the continued establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets could change in the future based on our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
reversal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of reversal 
to the extent there is a reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance  future financial statements would reflect an increase in non cash income tax expense until such time as our deferred tax assets are all used to reduce current taxes payable 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been  and  respectively  for the years  and these rates differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the mix of income and losses in foreign jurisdictions  which have tax rates that differ from the statutory rate  non deductible impairment of goodwill expenses  and non deductible acquisition related expenses 
we file in multiple tax jurisdictions and from time to time are subject to audit in certain tax jurisdictions  but we believe that we are adequately reserved for these exposures

our future cash obligations for leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities total approximately million 
the lease accrual represents the present value of the excess of our lease commitments on the vacated space over expected payments to be received on subleases of the relevant facilities 
the lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate earlier terminations

the lease payments will be made over the remaining term of the lease  which expires in all payments related to restructuring actions are expected to be funded through working capital 
see note n to our consolidated financial statements in item for the activity in the restructuring and other costs accrual for our cash requirements vary depending on factors such as our growth  capital expenditures  acquisitions of businesses or technologies and obligations under restructuring programs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so or that we could do so on favorable terms

during the terms of these financing arrangements  which are generally for three years  we may remain liable for a portion of the unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user  but our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances

revised  business combinations 
sfas r makes significant changes to the accounting and reporting standards for business acquisitions 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for an acquirer s financial statement recognition and measurement of the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  including those arising from contractual contingencies  any contingent consideration  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date 
sfas r amends sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable as a result of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital  depending on the circumstances 
the statement also amends sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to  among other things  provide guidance for the impairment testing of acquired research and development intangible assets and assets that the acquirer intends not to use 
sfas r is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  and may not be adopted early or applied retrospectively 
the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on our accounting for business combinations occurring on or after the adoption date  but the effect will be dependent on the acquisitions made at that time 
adoption will also have an impact on changes in deferred tax valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties related to acquisitions made before the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires that a noncontrolling interest  or minority interest  be recognized as equity in the consolidated financial statements and that it be presented separately from the parent s equity 
also  the amounts of net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest must be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas no 
clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary constitute equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  with that gain or loss measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests  all other requirements may only be applied prospectively 
adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have significant international operations and  therefore  our revenues  earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  sales transactions and net investments in foreign operations 
we derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances  we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts 
there are two objectives of our foreign currency forward contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
these forward contracts typically mature within days of execution 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies and contract rates versus financial statement rates 
to the extent these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound and canadian dollar  as a hedge against actual and forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
the mark to market effect associated with these contracts was a net unrealized loss of  at december  for the year ended december   net losses of million resulting from forward contracts and million of net transaction and remeasurement losses on the related assets and liabilities were included in our results of operations 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term certificates of deposit  commercial paper  asset backed securities  agency bonds and discount notes 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturities
