throughout this discussion  the activities of pi are included in the results of the company s cash advance segment 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise held for disposition  allowance for losses on cash advances  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
finance and service charges revenue recognition 
the company accrues finance and service charges revenue only on those pawn loans that the company deems collectible based on historical loan redemption statistics 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
the gathering of this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn loan portfolio and estimate the probability of collection of finance and service charges 
if the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
due to the short term nature of pawn loans  the company can quickly identify performance trends 
for  million  or  of recorded finance and service charges represented cash collected from customers and the remaining million  or  represented an increase in the finance and service charges receivable during the year 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of finance and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of finance and service charges revenue was overestimated or underestimated by  finance and service charges revenue would decrease or increase by million in and net income would decrease or increase by million 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
any increase would be realized as additional service charge revenue 
merchandise held for disposition 
merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid  however  the company also liquidates merchandise that is purchased directly from customers 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral and other merchandise held for disposition is stated at the lower of cost the cash amount loaned in the case of forfeited collateral or market 
management provides an allowance for shrinkage and valuation based on its evaluation of the merchandise 
because pawn loans are made without recourse to the borrower  the company does not investigate or rely upon the borrower s creditworthiness  but instead bases its lending decision on an evaluation of the pledged personal property 
the amount the company is willing to finance is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the company uses numerous sources in determining an item s estimated disposition value  including the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogs  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous experience with similar items 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on multiple occasions on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance 

table of contents during  the company modified its methodology for assessing the reasonableness of this allowance by taking a more comprehensive view of factors impacting the valuation of merchandise held for disposition 
beginning in  a greater emphasis was placed on shrinkage rates as a measure of adequacy of the allowance  while maintaining the other measures of merchandise quality used in prior periods 
management believes that this approach more accurately reflects the near term vulnerability of merchandise valuation impairment based on historical perspectives 
as a result  the allowance was reduced from million as of december  to million as of december   representing of the balance of merchandise held for disposition at december  as described above  the company conducts multiple physical count assessments of merchandise in all of its locations and immediately records the results of those activities directly to the income statement 
for the trailing six months ended december   the merchandise shortages charged to income was million  approximately of merchandise sales for the same period 
allowance for losses on cash advances 
the company maintains either an allowance or accrual for losses on cash advances including fees and interest at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the outstanding combined company and third party lender portfolio the portion owned by independent third party lenders 
the allowance for losses on company owned cash advances offsets the outstanding cash advance amounts in the consolidated balance sheets 
active third party lender originated cash advances are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
an accrual for contingent losses on third party lender owned cash advances that are guaranteed by the company is maintained and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company aggregates and tracks cash advances written during each calendar month to develop a performance history 
the company stratifies the outstanding combined portfolio by age  delinquency  and stage of collection when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for losses 
it uses historical collection performance adjusted for recent portfolio performance trends to develop the expected loss rates used to establish either the allowance or accrual 
increases in either the allowance or accrual are created by recording a cash advance loss provision in the consolidated statements of income 
the company charges off all cash advances once they have been in default for days or sooner if deemed uncollectible 
recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance when collected 
the company s online distribution channel periodically sells selected cash advances that have been previously written off 
proceeds from these sales are recorded as recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance for losses 
at december   the allowance for losses on cash advances was million and accrued losses on third party lender owned cash advances were million  in aggregate representing of the combined cash advance portfolio 
during fiscal year  the cash advance loss provision for the combined cash advance portfolio  which increases the allowance for loan losses  was million and reflects of gross combined cash advances written by the company and third party lenders 
if future loss rates increased  or decreased  by  or  from levels  the cash advance loss provision would increase  or decrease  by million and net income would decrease  or increase  by million  for the twelve month period assuming the same volume of cash advances written in valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets having an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of 
table of contents long lived and intangible assets may not be recoverable  impairment is measured based on the excess of the assets carrying value over the estimated fair value 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
an expense  or benefit  is included within the tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase  or decrease  in the valuation allowance for a given period

the company s net revenue  reduced by loan losses increased million  or  and million  or  for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to the prior year periods 
net revenue from pawn lending activities in the current year contributed of the increase due primarily to greater finance and service charges on higher average loan balances and increased profit on higher disposition volumes of merchandise 
the more significant contribution to year over year growth from pawn lending activities returns follows a disproportionate higher contribution to growth of net cash advance fees in compared to the prior year 
in the prior year of  cash advance fees  reduced by loan losses contributed of the increase  primarily due to the additional revenue and subsequent growth in revenue that followed the september acquisition of the online cash advance business

net revenue from pawn lending operations is comprised primarily of finance and service charges and profit from disposition of merchandise  both of which increased in as compared to  and includes the cash advance fees from pawn locations  which decreased in compared to the prior year period 
net revenue from the cash advance operations is described by distribution platform to reflect trends in revenue by source 
cash advance fees generated from the card services business includes other miscellaneous fees related to those card services  such as marketing and processing fees 
during  the contribution of cash advance revenue from storefront activities decreased as the company adjusted underwriting to reduce loss exposure and closed locations in various markets 
this decrease in storefront cash advance revenue was generally offset by growth in the company s online distribution platform during the year 
finance and service charges 
finance and service charges from pawn loans increased million  or  from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to higher loan 
table of contents balances attributable to the increased amount of pawn loans written through existing and new locations added during and an increase in the average balance of pawn loans outstanding contributed million of the increase and the higher annualized yield  which is a function of the blend in permitted rates for fees and service charges on pawn loans in all operating locations of the company  contributed million of the increase 
in addition  the company s decision to reduce the maximum loan term from days to days in pawn locations in the last half of contributed to higher reported pawn loan yields and contributed to better performance in the portfolio  as customer payments of finance and service charges occurred earlier and the maximum amount of fees and services charges would be lower as an overall percentage of the loan amount 
the average balances of loans outstanding during increased by million  or  compared to the increase was driven by an increase in the average amount per loan outstanding and a increase in the average number of pawn loans outstanding during management believes that the increase in the average amount per loan outstanding is attributable to higher gold prices allowing for greater loan amounts for loans secured by gold collateral 
pawn loan balances in domestic locations and foreign locations combined at december  were million  which was higher than at december  annualized loan yield was in  compared to in pawn loan balances for same stores stores that have been open for at least twelve months at december  increased million  or  as compared to december  on december   the company completed the acquisition of prenda f cil  a chain of pawnshops based in mexico  which had pawn loans receivable of mxp million mexican pesos  or usd million as of december  profit from the disposition of merchandise

overall gross profit margin decreased from in to in excluding the effect of the disposition of refined gold  the profit margin on the disposition of merchandise including jewelry sales increased to in from in the gross profit margin in was positively impacted by a million dollar reduction in the inventory valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of the current year  primarily due to a modification of the methodology used to assess the adequacy of this allowance 
excluding the impact of this modification on the total cost of disposed merchandise the gross profit margin would have been million  or  and  on merchandise excluding refined gold  the gross profit margin would have been million  or 
the profit margin on the disposition of refined gold decreased to in from in  primarily due to the higher advance rates on loans secured by gold following the increase in the market prices for gold in and early the company also experienced a increase in the volume of refined gold sold during  primarily due to a rising amount 
table of contents of pawn loans secured by jewelry  the liquidation of jewelry inventory  and the sale of gold items purchased directly from customers 
proceeds from disposition of merchandise  excluding refined gold  increased million  or  in  primarily due to the higher levels of retail sales activity that was supported by higher levels of merchandise available for disposition entering into the consolidated merchandise turnover rate increased to times in from times in as management emphasized disposition of merchandise in management expects that the profit margin on the disposition of merchandise will likely trend slightly below current levels mainly due to the weak economic environment which could reduce consumers appetite for retail purchases and an increase in the percentage mix of refined gold sales  which typically have lower gross profit margins 
management emphasized disposition activities throughout the year but particularly in the second half of  which resulted in the improved mix of merchandise under one year old but also contributed to lower gross profit margins in the second half of the table below summarizes the age of merchandise held for disposition before valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  at december  and dollars in thousands

for the trailing six months ended december   the merchandise shortages charged to income was million  approximately of merchandise sales for the same period 
this change causes the increase in merchandise balance to be higher than it would have been if the allowance had not changed 
applying the prior year allowance of million  reported net merchandise levels would have been up only  compared to the currently reported increase from to of 
cash advance fees 
cash advance fees increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in the increase in revenue from cash advance fees is predominantly due to the increase in customers using the company s online distribution channel  which offset the decrease in cash advance fees from storefront activities 
storefront cash advance fees and cash advance fees generated in pawn locations decreased in as the company adjusted underwriting criteria late in to reduce losses on cash advance loans and closed storefront cash advance locations during the year

in june  the governor of ohio signed into law legislation that capped the annual percentage rate  as defined in the statute apr  on payday loans in that state at  which effectively eliminated the profitability of the existing cash advance product in ohio 
upon the new law becoming effective in the fourth quarter of  the company s online business and its ohio storefronts  including the remaining ohio locations  began offering customers short term unsecured loans governed by the ohio second mortgage loan statute  and most of the remaining ohio cashland locations also began offering gold buying services

the company maintains an allowance for losses on cash advances at a level projected to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the outstanding combined cash advance portfolio 
the cash advance loss provision is utilized to increase the allowance carried against the outstanding company owned cash advance portfolio including participation interest in line of credit receivables acquired from a third party lender as well as expected losses in the third party lender owned portfolios which are guaranteed by the company 
the allowance is based on historical trends in portfolio performance based on the status of the balance owed by the customer

the quarterly sequential performance deviated from this typical cycle during  as sequential loss rates decreased from the third quarter to the fourth quarter 
management believes that this sequential decrease during was unusual and due mainly to the increase in customers with established borrowing histories as a percentage of all customers in the latter half of the year 
this change in mix was primarily in the portfolio of cash advances originated by the company s online channel 
in addition  management took steps to reduce losses in its storefront business beginning in the last half of  including additional underwriting guidelines and more emphasis on collections activities

the company is in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements 
a significant decline in demand for the company s products and services may cause the company to reduce its planned level of capital expenditures and lower its working capital needs in order to maintain compliance with the financial ratios in those agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and gold prices 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk 
management s objective is to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate cap agreements  may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations 
as of december   the company had outstanding two interest rate cap agreements with a combined notional amount of million

these interest rate cap agreements were perfectly effective at december  the company had variable rate borrowings outstanding of million and million at december  and  respectively 
if prevailing interest rates were to increase basis points over the rates at december   and the variable rate borrowings outstanding remained constant  the company s interest expense would increase by million  and net income after taxes would decrease by million in gold price risk 
the company periodically uses forward sale contracts with a major gold bullion bank to sell a portion of the expected amount of refined gold produced in the normal course of business from its liquidation of forfeited gold merchandise 
a significant decrease in the price of gold would result in a reduction of proceeds from the disposition of refined gold to the extent that amounts sold were in excess of the amount of contracted forward sales 
in addition  a significant and sustained decline in the price of gold would negatively impact the value of some of the goods pledged as collateral by customers and identified for liquidation as refined gold 
in this instance  management believes some customers would be willing to 
table of contents add additional items of value to their pledge in order to obtain the desired loan amount 
however  those customers unable or unwilling to provide additional collateral would receive lower loan amounts  possibly resulting in a lower balance of pawn loans outstanding for the company 
foreign currency exchange risk

as a result of fluctuations in these currencies  the company recorded foreign currency transaction losses of  and  in and  all of which were related to transactions involving the british pound
