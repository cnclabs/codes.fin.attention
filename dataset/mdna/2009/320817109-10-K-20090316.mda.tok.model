critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles require management to apply significant judgment to certain accounting  reporting and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions and estimates to apply those principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical 
for a complete discussion of the corporation s significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements and discussion throughout this annual report on form k 
below is a discussion of the corporation s critical accounting policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the corporation s financial statements 
management has reviewed the application of these policies with the corporation s audit committee 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the corporation s loan portfolio 
in determining the appropriate amount of the allowance for loan losses  management makes numerous assumptions  estimates and assessments 
the corporation s strategy for credit risk management includes conservative credit policies and underwriting criteria for all loans  as well as an overall credit limit for each customer significantly below legal lending limits 
the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic  industry and customer level  regular credit quality reviews and management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality 
the corporation s allowance consists of three components probable losses estimated from individual reviews of specific loans  probable losses estimated from historical loss rates  and probable losses resulting from economic  environmental  qualitative or other deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the first two components of the allowance 
larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
where appropriate  reserves are allocated to individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the corporation 
included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
any allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or fair value of the underlying collateral 
the corporation evaluates the collectibility of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
historical loss rates are applied to other commercial loans not subject to specific reserve allocations 
homogenous loans  such as consumer installment and residential mortgage loans  are not individually risk graded 
reserves are established for each pool of loans using loss rates based on a three year average net charge off history by loan category 
historical loss allocations for commercial and consumer loans may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors which management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies  trends in loan growth and charge off rates  changes in mix  concentrations of loans in specific industries  asset quality trends delinquencies  charge offs and nonaccrual loans  risk management and loan administration  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the corporation s internal loan review 
an unallocated reserve  primarily based on the factors noted above  is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans or pools of loans 
allowances on individual loans and historical loss allocations are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions 
the corporation s primary market areas for lending are central  north central and east central indiana and columbus  ohio 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowance  consideration is given to this regional geographic concentration and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the corporation s customers 
the corporation has not substantively changed any aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance 
valuation of securities 
the corporation s available for sale security portfolio is reported at fair value 
the fair value of a security is determined based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on quoted prices of similar instruments 
available for part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies continued sale and held to maturity securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the length of time the fair value has been below cost  the expectation for that security s performance  the creditworthiness of the issuer and the corporation s ability to hold the security to maturity 
a decline in value that is considered to be other than temporary is recorded as a loss within other operating income in the consolidated statements of income 
pension 
the corporation provides pension benefits to its employees 
its accounting policies related to pensions and other postretirement benefits reflect the guidance in sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the corporation does not consolidate the assets and liabilities associated with the pension plan 
instead  the corporation recognizes the funded status of the plan in the balance sheet 
the measurement of the funded status and the annual pension expense involves actuarial and economic assumptions 
various statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions on the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  expected rates of salary increases and health care costs and trends 
the corporation considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates in making these assumptions 
the primary assumptions used in determining the corporation s pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses are presented in note employee benefit plans in the annual report for the specific assumptions used by the corporation 
goodwill and intangibles 
for purchase acquisitions  the corporation is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives for which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  as well as on an interim basis  if events or changes indicate that the asset may be impaired  indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the corporation has elected to test for goodwill impairment as of september of each year 
an impairment loss must be recognized for any excess of carrying value over fair value of the goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible with subsequent reversal of the impairment loss being prohibited 
the tests for impairment fair values are based on internal valuations using management s assumptions of future growth rates  future attrition  discount rates  multiples of earnings or other relevant factors 
the resulting estimated fair values could have a significant impact on the carrying values of goodwill or intangibles and could result in impairment losses being recorded in future periods 
the corporation cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the effect of the economic environment on the corporation s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationship with significant customers 
derivative instruments 
as part of our asset liability management program  the corporation will utilize  from time to time  interest rate floors  caps or swaps to reduce its sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations 
these are derivative instruments  which are recorded as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are reported in the consolidated income statements or other comprehensive income oci depending on the use of the derivative and whether the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting 
the key criterion for the hedge accounting is that the hedged relationship must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in those cash flows that are attributable to the hedged risk  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis 
derivatives that qualify for the hedge accounting treatment are designated as either a hedge of the fair value of the recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge 
to date  the corporation has only entered into a cash flow hedge 
for cash flow hedges  changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are reported in oci to the extent the hedge is effective 
the gains and losses on derivative instruments that are reported in oci are reflected in the consolidated income statement in the periods in which the results of operations are impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item 
generally  net interest income is increased or decreased by amounts receivable or payable with respect to the derivatives  which qualify for hedge accounting 
at inception of the hedge  the corporation establishes the method it uses for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and the measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  is recognized currently in the consolidated statements of income 
the corporation excludes the time value expiration of the hedge when measuring ineffectiveness

results of operations and as of december  total assets equaled billion  an increase of million from december  loans and investments  the corporation s primary earning assets  increased by million  or percent 
during  management strategically reduced several earning asset categories  with a view toward higher performance and capital maximization 
details of these changes are discussed within the earning assets section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income for totaled million  an increase of million  or percent from diluted earnings per share totaled  a percent increase from reported in the increase was primarily attributed to increases in earning assets 
this volume increase was offset by a decrease in net interest margin of basis points and increased expenses related to two strategic non recurring expenses 
the first is related to the early redemption of the corporation s subordinated debentures payable to first merchants capital trust i and subsequent redemption by first merchants capital trust i of its outstanding common and preferred fixed rate securities nasdaq frmep 
the early redemption of the debentures required the corporation to accelerate the recognition of the remaining unamortized underwriting fee of approximately million  or 
per share 
the second is related to expenses of million related to the successful completion of the corporation s integration of commerce national bank  as well as the charter and data mergers of four banks into first merchants 
these factors and others are discussed within the respective sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the corporation s regulatory capital fell slightly below the regulatory well capitalized standard at december  tier i regulatory capital consists primarily of total stockholders equity and subordinated debentures issued to business trusts categorized as qualifying borrowings  less non qualifying intangible assets and unrealized net securities gains or losses 
the corporation s tier i capital to average assets ratio was percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
at december   the corporation had a tier i risk based capital ratio of percent and total risk based capital ratio of percent 
regulatory capital guidelines require a tier i risk based capital ratio of at least percent and a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent 
the decrease in the corporation s regulatory capital ratios for the year is primarily attributable to two factors 
the first factor of note is the decline in first merchants other comprehensive income resulting from investment security write downs under sfas totaling million during the year 
the second factor is a combination of items related to the lincoln bancorp acquisition 
the corporation used cash of million as part of the million purchase price resulting in increased common equity of million to acquire an million institution 
additionally  as a result of the acquisition  first merchants added million of intangibles from the closing of lincoln bancorp

asset quality provision for loan losses the corporation s primary business focus is small business and middle market commercial and residential real estate  auto and small consumer lending  which results in portfolio diversification 
management ensures that appropriate methods to understand and underwrite risk are utilized 
commercial loans are part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset quality provision for loan losses continued individually underwritten and judgmentally risk rated 
they are periodically monitored and prompt corrective actions are taken on deteriorating loans 
retail loans are typically underwritten with statistical decision making tools and are managed throughout their life cycle on a portfolio basis 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained through the provision for loan losses  which is a charge against earnings 
the amount provided for loan losses and the determination of the adequacy of the allowance are based on a continuous review of the loan portfolio  including an internally administered loan watch list and an independent loan review 
the evaluation takes into consideration identified credit problems  as well as the possibility of losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified 
see critical accounting policies in connection with recent economic developments  many financial institutions  including the corporation  have experienced unusual and significant declines in the performance of their loan portfolios  and the values of real estate collateral supporting many loans have declined 
if current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue  we expect that loan delinquencies and credit losses may increase 
although the corporation believes its underwriting and loan review procedures are appropriate for the various kinds of loans it makes  the corporation s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected in the event the quality of its loan portfolio deteriorates 
at december   non performing loans totaled  an increase of  of which the addition of lincoln at december accounted for  of the increase 
loans days past due other than non accrual and restructured loans increased by  the amount of non accrual loans totaled  at december  and lincoln accounted for  of non accrual loans 
non performing loans will increase or decrease going forward due to portfolio growth  routine problem loan recognition and resolution through collections  sales or charge offs 
the performance of any loan can be affected by external factors  such as economic conditions  or factors particular to a borrower  such as actions of a borrower s management 
at december   impaired loans totaled  an increase of  from year end lincoln accounted for  of the increase in impaired loans  which were at their fair value on the acquisition date of december  at december   a specific allowance for losses was not deemed necessary for impaired loans totaling  but a specific allowance of  was recorded for the remaining balance of impaired loans of  and is included in the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
the average balance of impaired loans for was  the increase of total impaired loans is primarily due to the increase of performing  substandard classified loans  which comprise a portion of the corporation s total impaired loans 
a loan is deemed impaired when  based on current information or events  it is probable that all amounts due of principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
for the corporation  all classified loans  including substandard  doubtful and loss credits  are included in the impaired loan total

construction and land development represents percent of total capital and percent of total loans 
management continues to closely monitor this portfolio for existing projects  as well as being very selective with additional exposure to this industry 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was  an increase of  from year end as a percent of loans  the allowance was percent at december  and 
percent at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at december  the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is critical to our financial results 
it requires management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments  as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain 
therefore  the allowance for loan losses  considering current factors at the time  including economic conditions and ongoing internal and external examination processes  will increase or decrease as deemed necessary to ensure the allowance for loan losses remains adequate 
in addition  the allowance as a percentage of charge offs and nonperforming loans will change at different points in time based on credit performance  loan mix and collateral values

liquidity liquidity management is the process by which the corporation ensures that adequate liquid funds are available 
these funds are necessary in order for the corporation and its subsidiaries to meet financial commitments on a timely basis 
these commitments include withdrawals by depositors  funding credit obligations to borrowers  paying dividends to shareholders  paying operating expenses  funding capital expenditures  and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
liquidity is monitored and closely managed by the corporation s asset liability committee 
liquidity is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from bank subsidiaries  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  and access to other funding sources 
liquidity of our bank subsidiaries is derived primarily from core deposit growth  principal payments received on loans  the sale and maturity of investment securities  net cash provided by operating activities  and access to other funding sources 
the most stable source of liability funded liquidity for both the long term and short term is deposit growth and retention in the core deposit base 
in addition  the corporation utilizes advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb and a revolving line of credit with lasalle bank  na lasalle as funding sources 
at december   total borrowings from the fhlb were  our bank subsidiaries have pledged certain mortgage loans and certain investments to the fhlb

part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity continued for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the principal source of asset funded liquidity is investment securities classified as available for sale  the market values of which totaled  at december   an increase of  or percent over december  securities classified as held to maturity that are maturing within a short period of time can also be a source of liquidity 
securities classified as held to maturity and that are maturing in one year or less totaled  at december  in addition  other types of assets  such as cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  and loans and interest bearing deposits with other banks maturing within one year are sources of liquidity 
in the normal course of business  the corporation is a party to a number of other off balance sheet activities that contain credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
such activities include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments  commitments under operating leases and long term debt 
the corporation provides customers with off balance sheet credit support through loan commitments and standby letters of credit

interest sensitivity and disclosures about market risk asset liability management has been an important factor in the corporation s ability to record consistent earnings growth through periods of interest rate volatility and product deregulation 
management and the board of directors monitor the corporation s liquidity and interest sensitivity positions at regular meetings to review how changes in interest rates may affect earnings 
decisions regarding investment and the pricing of loan and deposit products are made after analysis of reports designed to measure liquidity  rate sensitivity  the corporation s exposure to changes in net interest income given various rate scenarios and the economic and competitive environments 
it is the objective of the corporation to monitor and manage risk exposure to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
it is the goal of the corporation s asset liability function to provide optimum and stable net interest income 
to accomplish this  management uses two asset liability tools 
gap interest rate sensitivity reports and net interest income simulation modeling are constructed  presented and monitored quarterly 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest sensitivity and disclosures about market risk continued management believes that the corporation s liquidity and interest sensitivity position at december   remained adequate to meet the corporation s primary goal of achieving optimum interest margins while avoiding undue interest rate risk

the corporation had a cumulative negative gap of  in the one year horizon at december   percent of total assets 
the corporation places its greatest credence in net interest income simulation modeling 
the above gap interest rate sensitivity report is believed by the corporation s management to have two major shortfalls 
the gap interest rate sensitivity report fails to precisely gauge how often an interest rate sensitive product reprices  nor is it able to measure the magnitude of potential future rate movements 
net interest income simulation modeling  or earnings at risk  measures the sensitivity of net interest income to various interest rate movements 
the corporation s asset liability process monitors simulated net interest income under three separate interest rate scenarios  base  rising and falling 
estimated net interest income for each scenario is calculated over a month horizon 
the immediate and parallel changes to the base case scenario used in the model are presented below 
the interest rate scenarios are used for analytical purposes and do not necessarily represent management s view of future market movements 
rather  these are intended to provide a measure of the degree of volatility interest rate movements may introduce into the earnings of the corporation 
the base scenario is highly dependent on numerous assumptions embedded in the model  including assumptions related to future interest rates 
while the base sensitivity analysis incorporates management s best estimate of interest rate and balance sheet dynamics under various market rate movements  the actual behavior and resulting earnings impact will likely differ from that projected 
for mortgage related assets  the base simulation model captures the expected prepayment behavior under changing interest rate environments 
assumptions and methodologies regarding the interest rate or balance behavior of indeterminate maturity products  such as savings  money market  now and demand deposits  reflect management s best estimate of expected future behavior 
the comparative rising basis points and falling basis points scenarios below  as of december   assume further interest rate changes in addition to the base simulation discussed above
