this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements regarding future events and our future results are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections  and the beliefs and assumptions of our management including  without limitation  our expectations and beliefs regarding the following closing our manufacturing facility at the end of the first quarter of  that there are measurable expansion opportunities into new geographical regions and additional vertical markets  the demand for additional rugged form factors or platforms will keep pace with increasingly rapid mobilization of the general workforce as well as military personnel  fulfilling our minimum purchase requirement within the agreed upon time frame with respect to a minimum purchase agreement we entered into with one of our suppliers  we must continue to invest in research and development to maximize potential market penetration  by providing highly differentiated and leveraged turnkey vertical market solutions that deliver meaningful innovations and are supported by integrated sales and marketing programs  we create measurable barriers of entry to traditional contract manufacturers  our future success will depend in large part upon our relationships with key dell personnel  our sales to dell will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue in the near term  the lack of significant credit losses from our customers  our current assets  including cash  cash equivalents and investments  and expected cash flows from operating activities  will be sufficient to fund our operations in  our anticipated additions to property  plant and equipment and any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program for at least the next months  the current liquidity issues related to our auction rate securities will not impact our ability to fund our ongoing business operations  we will continue to receive interest payments as long as we hold the auction rate securities  our facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our current operating needs  a ten percent change in interest rates will not have a significant impact on our interest income  our strong patent portfolio and intellectual property position will allow us to continue to expand our business  the strength of our intellectual property rights is  and will continue to be  critical to the success of our business and will allow us to compete favorably against our competition  our intent to vigorously protect our intellectual property  our revenue recognition with respect to samsung s claim has been appropriate  incurring additional restructuring charges during the first quarter of  our future success will depend upon our ability to attract and retain personnel  our adoption of sfas for our non financial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  and the concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by the relatively short collection terms and the high level of credit worthiness of our customers

overview until july  we focused exclusively on providing advanced module and system level products for high reliability and high performance markets by offering stacking services  as well as memory module services  as explained in more detail below 
historically  we reported our revenue under one segment 
on july   we acquired augmentix corporation 
augmentix primarily re engineers and ruggedizes certain dell products to provide solutions with the latest technologies  high performance levels  enhanced 
table of contents functionality and reliability  and the potential for a low total cost of ownership for mission critical  rugged computing solutions 
as a result of this acquisition  we now report under two segments  memory solutions and rugged technology solutions 
on december   we announced our plan to close manufacturing activities of our memory solutions business in the first quarter of we will continue to license our extensive stacking patent portfolio  but have transferred our memory and stacking customers and certain manufacturing assets to third parties 
we took this action because it became challenging to maintain a long term profitable outlook for this part of our business 
with our acquisition of augmentix  we decided to shift our focus away from commodity component markets towards vertical computing segments 
memory solutions in  we were a provider of advanced electronic systems and sub systems for enterprise  consumer and other high growth markets 
our tsop and bga memory stacking solutions increase operational performance by doubling  tripling or quadrupling the amount of memory in the same physical footprint as required by standard packaging technologies 
our arcticore technology is a module technology using a double sided  multi layer flexible circuit folded around an aluminum core and is designed for superior thermal  mechanical and electrical performance 
our other memory module technologies enable custom  as well as jedec standard r dimms  fb dimms and so dimms  with the characteristics of high density and thermal efficiencies 
through an acquisition and internal development efforts  we worked to diversify our products and markets 
on august   we acquired southland  a provider of memory products and services to oems located in irvine  california 
in the second quarter of  we began to move manufacturing from irvine to our facility in reynosa  mexico 
in november  we announced a settlement agreement with the selling stockholders of southland  in which we were released from our lease obligations on the irvine facility  among other matters as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we applied our expertise in memory stacking as well as module solutions to provide intellectual property and services that enabled system oem customers to cost effectively improve the performance and reliability of their systems 
by stacking industry standard memory  our stakpak solutions can deliver up to four times the memory capacity per memory module as compared to current generation monolithic ics 
most of our memory stacking units contain stacked dram packages or nand flash memory packages 
customers generally adopted our package stacking technologies for three primary reasons to achieve higher memory densities using more generally available and often more cost effective lower density parts  to leverage dram component pricing and availability arbitrage often found between higher density and lower density parts and to enable the optimum supply flexibility supporting memory ics of various densities from various suppliers 
our advanced module technologies deliver better capacity  reliability and electrical and thermal performance compared to conventional module technologies 
in addition to memory packages  our advanced module solutions include additional active and passive components as required by the overall solution  eg  registers  buffers or controllers 
during  our customers could license our technologies for their in house stacking of memory units  outsource their manufacturing needs to us  buy memory units from one of our licensees  such as samsung  smart and toshiba  or optimize their needs through a combination of these approaches 
in  our customers can continue to license our technologies for their in house stacking of memory units  as well as buy memory units from one of our licensees  such as samsung  smart  and toshiba 
we have an ip portfolio of more than patents and patent applications pending 
headquartered in austin  texas  in  we operated two iso certified manufacturing facilities in irvine  california and reynosa  mexico 
during the second quarter of  we terminated manufacturing in irvine  california  and as set forth above  we expect to terminate manufacturing in reynosa  mexico during the first quarter of 
table of contents rugged technology solutions through augmentix  we develop innovative  highly differentiated and leveraged solutions for a large oem customer  enabling us to address targeted vertical markets representing incremental growth opportunities 
our rugged notebook solutions  which we sell to a large oem as part of an engineering and manufacturing relationship  redefine the value customers should expect from military standard mil std f rugged devices 
we also re engineer and ruggedize dell poweredge servers to provide leveraged solutions that are setting new standards for rugged servers with the latest technologies  extreme performance levels and enhanced functionality and reliability 
our third product line  the a samp  is a self contained  single board embedded computer that offers enhanced availability and manageability of our a rugged servers 
a samp lite is a derivative embedded computer that is integrated into a pbx voip telephone system by a major oem customer and provides remote system management and control capabilities to maximize system uptime or availability 
samsung update we have a license arrangement with samsung  pursuant to which we have licensed certain technologies to samsung  and samsung provides to us quarterly reports of its license usage and pays corresponding royalty amounts in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
we have primarily relied on these reports from samsung and subsequent cash payment to record revenue from this license agreement 
during the second quarter of  samsung sent us a letter asserting that it made errors in the royalty reports that it previously delivered to us during the period beginning in the fourth quarter of and ending in the first quarter of samsung stated that it believes that these errors resulted in an overpayment to us of an aggregate of approximately million  and samsung has requested that we refund this amount 
samsung paid to us a total of million during this time period 
because of information provided to us by samsung regarding excessive yield loss and independent information we have obtained  we do not believe it would be appropriate to make any changes to our financial reports or book allowances related to this refund request  and we believe that our revenue recognition has been appropriate

product revenue in was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
license revenue in was million  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
memory solutions total revenue decreased million  from million during to million in the decrease in our memory solutions revenue was primarily due to the decline in demand for our memory stacking products in both leaded package and bga stacks 
this decline was driven by the shift from ddr to ddr technologies 
ddr devices are enclosed in bga packages  and the demand for stacks of this technology did not grow to offset the decline in leaded packages 
the demand for bga stacks was hindered by the availability of other competitive solutions  including dual die and planar technologies 
the decline in stacking product revenue was partially offset by the increase in revenue generated from our memory module products  of which we had only four months of revenue in  as a result of our southland acquisition at the end of august 
table of contents license revenue decreased million during  compared with  which was mainly the result of decreased royalties from samsung 
the samsung license is for our leaded package technologies  which are being replaced over time by bga technologies 
as a result of the augmentix acquisition in july and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  we added a second segment  rugged technology solutions  during the third quarter of revenue in this segment is primarily generated from the sale of ruggedized computer solutions 
our rugged technology solutions revenue increased from in to million in this increase more than offset the million decline in memory solutions revenue 
subsequent to the first quarter of  we will only generate license revenue from our memory solutions segment in addition to the revenue generated from our rugged technology solutions segment 
our decrease in product revenue during  compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in both leaded package and bga stacks 
this decline was driven by the continuing shift from ddr to ddr technologies 
ddr devices are enclosed in bga packages  and the demand for stacks of this technology did not grow to offset the decline in leaded packages 
the demand for bga stacks was hindered by the availability of other competitive solutions  including dual die and planar technologies 
in addition  the price differential between mbit devices and gbit devices declined during  temporarily reducing a key value proposition associated with stacking the mbit packages 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in flash based stacks and by million in revenue from our southland acquisition for the last four months of license revenue decreased million during  compared with  which was mainly the result of decreased royalties from samsung 
the samsung license is for our leaded package technologies  which are being replaced over time by bga technologies

table of contents gross profit loss gross loss for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue 
this amount represents a decrease of million  compared to gross profit of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the change in our gross loss for the year ended december   as compared to a gross profit for the year ended december   was primarily due to i recording an impairment charge related to our trade name intangible asset  land  building and lab equipment for approximately million  as a result of a decline in revenue and negative cash flow related to our memory solutions business  ii recording an additional reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of approximately million related to our dimm inventory and iii a shift towards the sale of memory modules  which carry a lower gross margin than our historical stacking products 
the gross margin on our stacking products declined due to lower license revenue and fixed costs being spread over lower volumes 
these declines were partially offset by the gross profit generated from our rugged notebook and server products 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue 
this amount represents a decrease of million  compared to gross profit of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  the reduction in our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue during  compared to  was primarily due to lower gross margin on our product business resulting from fixed costs being spread over fewer units 
additionally  license revenue  for which there was no corresponding impact on our cost of revenue  declined by million 
the acquisition of southland further contributed to the decline in gross margin as a percentage of total revenue due to higher material costs associated with the sale of memory modules relative to memory stacking 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue 
this amount reflected a decrease of million  or  compared to selling  general and administrative expense of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expense included stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense during  compared to  was primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense  partially offset by higher personnel related costs associated with the acquisitions of southland and augmentix 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue 
this amount reflected an increase of million  or  compared to selling  general and administrative expense of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expense included stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense during  relative to  was primarily due to increased personnel related costs in connection with our acquisition of southland 
research and development research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  which reflected an increase of million  or  compared with research and development expense of million  or of total revenue for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  research and development expense included stock based compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in research and development expense during  relative to  was primarily due to the addition of research and development expense associated with the acquisition of augmentix  partially offset by decreased personnel related costs related to our traditional stacking business and lower stock based compensation expense 

table of contents research and development expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total revenue  which reflected a decrease of million  or  compared with research and development expense of million  or of total revenue for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  research and development expense included stock based compensation expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expense during  compared to  mainly resulted from reductions in personnel related costs 
restructuring expense during the second quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million due to a workforce reduction of approximately positions as a result of transferring our memory solutions manufacturing operations in irvine  california to reynosa  mexico 
we completed this transition during the third quarter of  resulting in an additional charge of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring expense of million due to a workforce reduction of approximately positions as a result of our plan to close manufacturing activities of our memory solutions business 
during the first quarter of  we expect to incur an additional charge of approximately million related to closing our manufacturing facility in mexico  consisting of additional restructuring expense and closing costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring expense of million 
provision for doubtful accounts provision for doubtful accounts expense for the year ended december   and was million   and  respectively 
the increase in our provision for doubtful accounts was primarily due to the bankruptcy of a large customer during goodwill impairment as of october   the goodwill remaining on the balance sheet was associated with our rugged technology solutions segment 
at that time we undertook our annual goodwill assessment and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
however  during the fourth quarter of  due to continued challenges presented by general economic conditions and our low market capitalization  we conducted a review to update the fair value of the rugged technology solutions segment 
as a result of that review  we recorded a non cash charge of million during the fourth quarter of for the impairment of the goodwill created by the augmentix acquisition 
the impairment charge reflects increased uncertainty in the business due to recent economic developments 
the decline in revenue and negative cash flow related to our dimm business unit during the third quarter of was an indicator of potential goodwill impairment 
because of this decline  we completed an impairment analysis of this reporting unit 
as a result of that review  we recorded a non cash charge of million during the third quarter of for the write off of the goodwill related to our dimm business unit  which we established in connection with our southland acquisition 
the impairment charge reflected the changing business prospects for our dimm business and declining demand for our products 
based on our annual assessment on october   we determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
the decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of was an indicator of potential goodwill impairment  and because of this decline we undertook an assessment on december  to determine the fair value of our business associated with the goodwill 
as a result of that review  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the write down of the goodwill related to our stacking business that austin ventures acquired in august the impairment charge reflected the changing business prospects for our stacking business  declining utilization of our processes by licensees and declining demand for our products 

table of contents critical estimates made in determining the fair value of our memory solutions segment included expected future cash flows from licensing agreements and product sales  customer turnover and future overhead expenses 
critical estimates made in determining the fair value of our rugged technology solutions segment include future customer turnover and operating margins 
management s best estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
amortization and impairment of acquisition intangibles and fixed assets during the year ended december   we amortized million of intangible assets resulting from the staktek  southland and augmentix acquisitions  with million allocated to cost of revenue and million to operating expenses 
in  we expect to incur amortization expense of million  with million allocated to cost of revenue and million to operating expenses 
the acquisition intangibles were originally valued using a discounted cash flow methodology 
as a result  the scheduled amortization expense will vary from year to year 
for interim periods within each year  amortization expense is recorded on a straight line basis 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of our decision to close our operations in reynosa  mexico  we reviewed the value of our land and building there 
we estimated the cash flow that would result from the disposal of those assets and booked an impairment expense of million in the fourth quarter of as of september   as a result of a decline in revenue and negative cash flow related to our dimm business unit  we impaired the remaining residual value of our trade name intangible asset acquired through our southland acquisition and we impaired the lab equipment for our dimm business unit 
as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately million  which is included in impairment of acquisition intangibles and fixed assets in cost of revenue 
in addition  we impaired the remaining residual value of our customer relationship and non compete agreements acquired through our southland acquisition as a result of the decline in revenue and negative cash flow related to our dimm business unit and recorded a charge of approximately million  which is included in impairment of acquisition intangibles in operating expenses 
as of june   as a result of the anticipated reduction in the future cash flow from our license agreement with samsung  we tested our customer relationship intangible asset for impairment 
as a result of our review  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which is include in impairment of acquisition intangibles and fixed assets in cost of revenue 
the value was initially recorded based upon the projected discounted net cash flows attributable to this relationship 
during the year ended december   we amortized million of intangible assets resulting from the staktek and southland acquisitions  with million allocated to cost of revenue and million to operating expenses 
as of march   as a result of our customers increased use of competitive technologies and the associated uncertainty around our future revenue  we tested our trademark intangible asset for impairment 
as a result of our review  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  which is included in impairment of acquisition intangibles and fixed assets in cost of revenue 
as of march   we also determined that the trademark intangible asset had an estimated remaining useful life of four years 
during the second quarter of  we began amortizing the remaining balance of million over its estimated useful life in proportion to the estimated contribution to discounted cash flows during the four year period 
interest and other income expense interest and other income  net  for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income  net was mainly due to a lower balance in our 
table of contents cash  cash equivalents and investments as a result of our southland and augmentix acquisitions and a reduction in our rate of return 
also  during we recorded approximately million in interest expense related to our convertible notes that we issued in connection with our acquisition of augmentix and other financing charges 
interest and other income  net  for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in interest and other income  net was mainly due to the cash received during as a result of recycling scrapped material 
benefit for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million   and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  our effective tax rate was  and  respectively 
management has determined that there is substantial doubt we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million in and approximately million in against our net deferred tax assets 
during  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the million valuation allowance 
during  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to recording the impairment of goodwill and the million valuation allowance 
during  the effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of  due primarily to the impact of certain stock based compensation expenses that were not tax deductible  in addition to other permanent items  including tax exempt interest income

in november  we entered into an agreement terminating our obligations with respect to this lease 
the capital lease commitment at december  was for office equipment 
purchase obligations included a purchase commitment at december  for the expected future costs to be incurred in the fulfillment of a minimum purchases contract with one of our vendors 
as of december   we expect to fulfill the minimum purchase requirement within the agreed upon time frame 
in connection with our acquisition of augmentix  we issued approximately million in convertible notes with an annual interest rate of to certain stockholders of augmentix 
interest payments are due each january and july  with the principal due on december  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these obligations 
as of december   we had no material future sales commitments to any of our customers

our long term investments consist of tax exempt ars  which have a long term maturity with the interest rate being reset to the maximum rate according to the applicable investment offering document 
during the first quarter of  auctions for certain of these securities began to fail 
as of december   we held approximately million of ars 
the underlying collateral of our ars consists primarily of student loans  of which are guaranteed by the federal government as part of the federal family education loans program ffelp 
the ffelp guarantees between and of the par value of these loans 
the remaining of our ars are private loans  of which are insured 
during  approximately million of our ars was called at par by the issuer 
as of december   there was insufficient observable ars market information available to determine the fair value of these investments 
therefore  our ars were valued based on a pricing model that included certain assumptions  such as our ars maximum interest rate  probability of passing auction  default probability and discount rate 
during november  we accepted an offer provided to us by the investment firm through which we hold our ars to sell our auction rate securities to this firm at par value at any time over a two year period  beginning june  and ending july  the agreement also provides access to loans up to of the par value for investment grade companies and up to of the par value for companies that are not investment grade until june  in connection with this settlement  we recorded a put option of approximately million related to our ars 
see note  investments  for additional information 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   and resulted primarily from our net loss of million adjusted by non cash expenses including the goodwill impairment of million  the intangible and fixed assets impairments of million  depreciation and amortization of intangibles of million and stock based compensation expense of million

effective july   as part of our acquisition of augmentix  we terminated our unsecured revolving loan agreement with guaranty bank 
we incurred negative cash flows from operations in in order to improve profitability and enhance cash flow  we decided to shift our focus away from commodity component markets towards vertical computing segments 
as a result  on december   we announced our plan to terminate manufacturing of our memory solutions business in the first quarter of we will continue to license our extensive stacking patent portfolio  but have transferred our memory and stacking customers and certain manufacturing assets to third parties 
based on these changes in our business operations  we believe that our current assets  including cash and cash equivalents  investments and expected cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  our anticipated additions to property  plant and equipment  interest payments and any share repurchases under our stock repurchase program for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to acquire other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise these funds by borrowing money or selling more stock to the public or to selected investors 
in addition  while we may not need additional funds  we may elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing more equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
critical accounting estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition and presentation 
our memory solutions business engages in transactions where we sell consigned inventory to third parties and where we provide licensees with inventory 
we evaluate these transactions and determine if the costs and revenue should be presented on a gross or net basis 
in making this determination  we primarily consider the following we are not adding value to the inventory through our manufacturing processes  we do not take risk of ownership of the inventory and our net revenue from the transaction is predefined 
in situations where these conditions are met  we net the expense of the components against the revenue from the transaction 
for the year ended december  we recorded approximately million in consigned inventory sales  net of cost 
we recognize initial nonrefundable license fees when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties and collection is reasonably assured 
we may provide training and or other assistance to our licensees under the terms of the license agreement 
the amount of training 
table of contents or assistance provided is limited and incidental to the licensed technology 
in instances where training or other assistance is provided under the terms of a license agreement  the estimated fair value of such services is deferred until these services are provided 
the associated revenue is included in product revenue 
in instances where we provide training or other assistance that is considered inconsequential to the license agreement  the estimated fair value of the services is recognized in connection with the initial license fee and is included in license revenue 
royalty revenue from our memory solutions business and rugged technology solutions business license agreements is recognized in the quarter in which our licensees report royalties to us 
certain licensees do not provide us with forward estimates or current quarter information concerning their shipments 
because we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of royalties earned during the period in which these licensees actually ship products using our technologies  we do not recognize royalty revenue until the royalties are reported to us and the collection of these royalties is reasonably assured 
deferred revenue 
our agreement with our largest oem related to sales of a specific product line within our rugged technology solutions business allows for price reductions  issued as rebates  as certain volume levels of shipments are reached 
the per unit price of lower quantity tiers is variable above a certain minimum price  since the price can be retroactively adjusted downward if certain volume levels are satisfied 
pursuant to emerging issues task force  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf issue  we consider these pricing changes as a right of return and defer the amount of rebate that could occur until the end of the period when the actual volume levels are reasonably estimable 
we estimate the amount of sales based on experience as well as forecasts provided by our oem 
revenue above the fixed minimum price is deferred until the actual volume levels are achieved 
the estimate is revised each reporting period and is ultimately adjusted to actual at the end of the year 
impairment of assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of losses on long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by such assets are less than the carrying value of these assets  and accordingly  all or a portion of this carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment losses are then measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to the carrying amounts 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of intangible assets require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected future cash flows from  and the expected life of  the intangible asset  as well as the appropriate discount rate 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of intangible assets represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  we could reach a different conclusion regarding whether an intangible asset is impaired and  if so  the amount of the impairment loss 
goodwill was our only intangible asset that was not amortized 
we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment as of october and periodically when indicators of impairment exist 
the goodwill impairment test requires judgment regarding the determination of fair value of our reporting units  and the determination of fair value of our assets and liabilities 
a reporting unit is defined as a component of an entity for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management and discrete financial information is available 
we periodically assess our goodwill for indications of impairment on a reporting unit level 
as of october   the goodwill remaining on the balance sheet was associated with our rugged technology solutions segment 
at that time we undertook our annual goodwill assessment and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
however  during the fourth quarter of  due to continued challenges presented by general economic conditions and our low market capitalization  we conducted a review to update the fair value of the rugged technology solutions segment 
as a result of that review  we recorded a non cash charge of million during the fourth quarter of for the impairment of the goodwill created by the augmentix acquisition 
the impairment charge reflected increased uncertainty in the business due to recent economic developments 

table of contents the decline in revenue and negative cash flow related to our dimm business unit during the third quarter of was an indicator of potential goodwill impairment 
because of this decline  we completed an impairment analysis of this reporting unit 
as a result of that review  we recorded a non cash charge of million during the third quarter of for the write off of the goodwill related to our dimm business unit  which we established in connection with our southland acquisition 
the impairment charge reflected the changing business prospects for our dimm business and declining demand for our products 
based on our annual assessment on october   we determined that no impairment of goodwill existed 
the decline in our market capitalization during the fourth quarter of was an indicator of potential goodwill impairment  and because of this decline  we conducted an assessment on december  to determine the fair value of our business associated with the goodwill 
as a result of that review  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the write down of the goodwill related to our stacking business that austin ventures acquired in august the impairment charge reflects the changing business prospects for our stacking business  declining utilization of our processes by licensees and declining demand for our products 
critical estimates made in determining the fair value of our memory solutions segment included expected future cash flows from licensing agreements and product sales  customer turnover and future overhead expenses 
critical estimates made in determining the fair value of our rugged technology solutions segment include future customer turnover and operating margins 
management s best estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
inventory and inventory reserves 
we value our inventory at standard cost and review our inventory for quantities in excess of production requirements and for obsolescence 
we maintain a reserve for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory  as well as for inventory with a carrying value in excess of its market value 
we review inventory on hand quarterly and record a provision for lower of cost or market  and for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory  if necessary 
the review is based on several factors  including a current assessment of future product demand  historical experience and market conditions 
if actual conditions are less favorable than those that we projected  additional inventory reserves may be required 
warranty 
we repair or replace products that have been authorized for repair or replacement by our customers 
we utilize a third party service provider to perform a full range of service and support options  ranging from telephone  online  on site  return to depot  and customer replaceable units parts available in the continental us and in select international cities 
the costs of such repairs or replacements are expensed as actual costs are incurred 
we warrant products for periods ranging from to months following the sale of our products 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs increase  our warranty costs to support the products in the field could increase 
income taxes 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance 
we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions  within which we are subject to tax as well as the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
the recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon audit  changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and  therefore  we did not restate prior periods results 

table of contents under this method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january   as well as those granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from the amount we have recorded in the current period 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp to clarify the application of fair value measurements of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
this clarifying guidance became effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued 
the adoption of fsp did not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
this new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets in business combinations and asset acquisitions 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  early adoption is prohibited 
the impact of adopting fsp will depend on the future business combinations or asset acquisitions that we may pursue after its effective date 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  which delayed the effective date of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
non recurring non financial assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of sfas include those measured at fair value in goodwill impairment testing  intangible assets measured at fair value for impairment  and those initially measured at fair value in a business combination 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas for our non financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
this standard establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  including goodwill  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or 
table of contents after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the impact of adopting sfas r will depend on the future business combinations that we may pursue after its effective date 
subsequent event we expect to record charges related to closing our manufacturing facility in mexico of approximately million in the first quarter of in connection with closing our manufacturing facility in mexico  we terminated approximately employees in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  all of whom signed a release of claims in exchange for severance 
these agreements released all legal claims against us 
approximately of these former employees have filed a legal action against us with the labor board in reynosa because they do not believe we paid them their full severance amounts as required by mexican law 
given the fact that all of these former employees signed a release of claims  appeared before the labor board when signing their releases stating that they agreed with the terms of the releases  and we paid the severance set forth in the releases  we do not believe we have any liability with respect to these claims 
we plan to defend these actions filed against us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
the functional currency of our subsidiary in mexico is the us dollar 
as a result  we have very little exposure to currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we believe that our currency exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the related income without significantly increasing risk 
even so  some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our interest income 
as of december   all of our cash was held in deposit or money market accounts  or invested in investment grade securities 
at december   we had amounts on deposit with financial institutions that were in excess of the federally insured limit of  we have not experienced any losses on deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our convertible notes 
the fair market value of our convertible notes is subject to interest rate risk because of their fixed interest rate and market risk due to the convertible feature of our convertible notes 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall  and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of our convertible notes will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of our convertible notes but do not impact their carrying value 
our long term investments include approximately million in ars 
during the first quarter of  auctions for certain of these securities began to fail 
the funds associated with failed auctions are not expected to be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the securities  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities mature 
additionally  if we determine that an other than temporary decline in the fair value of any of our ars has occurred  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investments through an impairment charge
