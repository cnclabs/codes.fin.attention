item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this report and our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain forward looking statements  which generally include the plans and objectives of management for future operations  including plans and objectives relating to our future economic performance and our current beliefs regarding revenues we might generate and profits we might earn if we are successful in implementing our business and growth strategies 
the forward looking statements and associated risks may include  relate to or be qualified by other important factors  including  without limitation fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and its co products  the projected growth or contraction in the ethanol and co product market in which we operate  our strategies for expanding  maintaining or contracting our presence in these markets  our ability to successfully develop  finance  construct and operate our current and any future ethanol production facilities  anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations  and our ability to distinguish ourselves from our current and future competitors 
we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any forward looking statements  except as required by law 
any of the factors described immediately above or in the risk factors section above could cause our financial results  including our net income or loss or growth in net income or loss to differ materially from prior results  which in turn could  among other things  cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
recent developments as a result of ethanol industry conditions that have negatively affected our business  we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital  debt service and other liquidity needs in the very near term 
we believe that we have sufficient working capital to continue operations only until approximately april  at the latest unless we successfully restructure our debt  experience a significant improvement in margins and obtain other sources of liquidity 
in addition  although various secured creditors are presently forbearing through april  under outstanding forbearance agreements from exercising their rights  once those forbearance periods expire or in the event of additional defaults  we will be in default to those secured creditors who collectively hold security interests in substantially all of our assets 
as a result  our financial statements include an explanatory paragraph by our independent registered public accounting firm describing the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
as of march   we owed approximately million in term loans and lines of credit associated with the construction and operation of our ethanol plants and approximately million under our revolving credit facility 
as of that date  we had only million in cash and million of additional borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility 
as we continue to reduce the number of gallons of ethanol we sell and hold in inventory  working capital available to support borrowings under our revolving credit facility will reduce proportionately 
we do not expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated working capital  debt service and other liquidity needs beyond april  at the latest unless we successfully restructure our debt  experience a significant improvement in margins and obtain other sources of liquidity 
based on the current spread between corn and ethanol prices  the industry is operating at or near break even cash margins 
the current spread between ethanol and corn prices cannot support the long term viability of the us ethanol industry in general or us in particular 
although we are actively pursuing a number of alternatives  including seeking to restructure our debt and seeking to raise additional debt or equity financing  or both  there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
if we cannot restructure our debt and obtain sufficient liquidity in the very near term  we may need to seek protection under the us bankruptcy code 
business overview our primary goal is to be the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states 
we produce and sell ethanol and its co products  including wet distillers grain  or wdg  and provide transportation  storage and delivery of ethanol through third party service providers in the western united states  primarily in california  nevada  arizona  oregon  colorado  idaho and washington 
we have extensive customer relationships throughout the western united states and extensive supplier relationships throughout the western and midwestern united states 
in september  we completed construction of our fourth ethanol plant 
our four ethanol plants  which produce ethanol and its co products  are as follows estimated annual date operations production capacity facility name facility location began gallons stockton stockton  ca september magic valley burley  id april columbia boardman  or september madera madera  ca october in addition  we own a interest in front range  which owns a plant located in windsor  colorado  with annual production capacity of up to million gallons 
we also intend to either construct or acquire additional production facilities as financial resources and business prospects make the construction or acquisition of these facilities advisable 
according to the united states department of energy  or doe  total annual gasoline consumption in the united states is approximately billion gallons 
total annual ethanol consumption represented less than of this amount in we believe that the domestic ethanol industry has substantial potential for growth to initially reach what we estimate is an achievable level of at least of the total annual gasoline consumption in the united states  or approximately billion gallons of ethanol annually and thereafter up to billion gallons of ethanol annually under the new national renewable fuel standards  or rfs  by see business governmental regulation 
the ethanol industry has experienced significant adverse conditions over the course of the last months  including prolonged negative operating margins 
we  too  have experienced these adverse conditions as well as severe working capital and liquidity shortages  and in response to such conditions  we have reduced production significantly until market conditions resume to acceptable levels and working capital becomes available 
we first reduced production in december and continued to reduce production through the first quarter of currently  we have ceased production at our madera  magic valley and stockton facilities 
we continue to operate our columbia and front range facilities 
we continue to assess market conditions and when appropriate  provided we have adequate available working capital  we plan to bring these facilities back to operation 
we intend to reach our goal to be the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states in part by expanding our relationships with customers and third party ethanol producers to market higher volumes of ethanol  by expanding our relationships with animal feed distributors and end users to build local markets for wdg  the primary co product of our ethanol production  and by expanding the market for ethanol by continuing to work with state governments to encourage the adoption of policies and standards that promote ethanol as a fuel additive and transportation fuel 
financial performance summary our net sales increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our net loss  however  increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  factors that contributed to our results of operations for include net sales 
the increase in our net sales in as compared to was primarily due to the following combination of factors o higher sales volumes 
total volume of ethanol sold increased by to million gallons in from million gallons in the increase in sales volume is primarily due to two additional ethanol production facilities that commenced operations in sales also increased in from additional supply purchased from third party suppliers under our ethanol marketing agreements  and o higher ethanol prices 
the increase in sales volume was also due to slightly higher ethanol prices 
our average sales price of ethanol increased to per gallon in as compared to per gallon in gross margins 
our gross margins decreased significantly to negative for as compared to a gross profit margin of for this drop in gross profit margins was primarily due to higher corn prices and was exacerbated by significant volatility in the corn market during volatility and the time from purchase of the corn to sale of the resulting ethanol created significant losses during the average price of corn increased by to per bushel in from per bushel in the average chicago board of trade  or cbot  price for corn increased by to per bushel in from per bushel in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in primarily as a result of increases in administrative staff  bad debt expenses  derivatives commissions and noncash compensation expenses  partially offset by decreases in professional fees and amortization of intangible assets 
although these expenses increased in absolute dollars  they decreased to of our net sales in as compared to of our net sales in due to the substantial growth in our net sales over those periods 
impairments of goodwill and asset group 
in  we recognized million in impairment of goodwill and million in impairment of asset group 
the impairment of goodwill related to our annual goodwill review  mostly reflecting a decline in the valuation of our prior purchase of our interest in front range 
the impairment of asset group reflects our decision to abandon construction of our imperial valley ethanol production facility due to adverse market conditions 
other expense 
our other expense decreased by million to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to increased sales of our business energy tax credits  decreased mark to market losses and decreased finance cost amortization  which were partially offset by an increase in interest expense  decreased interest income and increased bank fees 
sales and margins over the past three years  our sales mix has shifted significantly from sales generated solely as a marketer of ethanol produced by third parties to now include sales generated as a producer of our own ethanol 
our cost structure also changed significantly  beginning in  as our madera and front range facilities were in full production and continuing in as our columbia facility was in full production and our magic valley and stockton facilities commenced operations 
the shift in our sales mix greatly altered our dependency on certain market conditions from that based primarily on the market price of ethanol to that based significantly on the cost of corn  the principal input commodity for our production of ethanol 
accordingly  our profitability is now highly dependent on the market price of ethanol and the cost of corn 
average ethanol sales prices rose in as compared to specifically  the average cbot price of ethanol increased by in as compared to the increase in the prevailing market price of ethanol was primarily due to the rise of crude oil during the middle of average corn prices increased significantly in as compared to specifically  the average cbot price of corn increased by in as compared to the increase in the prevailing market price of corn was the primary cause of the increase in our average corn price 
more importantly  corn prices experienced significant volatility in a relatively short period of time during the average cbot price of corn increased from at the end of may to a record high of on june  and then decreased to at the end of july since we now produce more of the ethanol that we sell and there is a time lag from the time we price and purchase our corn to the actual sale of resultant ethanol to a customer  this volatility created significant negative margins for us in we have three principal methods of selling ethanol as a merchant  as a producer and as an agent 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition below 
when acting as a merchant or as a producer  we generally enter into sales contracts to ship ethanol to a customer s desired location 
we support these sales contracts through purchase contracts with several third party suppliers or through our own production 
we manage the necessary logistics to deliver ethanol to our customers either directly from a third party supplier or from our inventory via truck or rail 
our sales as a merchant or as a producer expose us to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and corn 
our exposure varies depending on the magnitude of our sales and purchase commitments compared to the magnitude of our existing inventory  as well as the pricing terms such as market index or fixed pricing of our contracts 
we seek to mitigate our exposure to price risks by implementing appropriate risk management strategies 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sale contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we receive a predetermined service fee and we have little or no exposure to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
we believe that our gross profit margins will primarily depend on five key factors the market price of ethanol  which we believe will be impacted by the degree of competition in the ethanol market  the price of gasoline and related petroleum products  and government regulation  including tax incentives  the market price of key production input commodities  including corn and natural gas  the market price of wdg  our ability to anticipate trends in the market price of ethanol  wdg  and key input commodities and implement appropriate risk management and opportunistic strategies  and the proportion of our sales of ethanol produced at our facilities to our sales of ethanol produced by third parties 
management seeks to optimize our gross profit margins by anticipating the factors above and  when resources are available  implementing hedging transactions and taking other actions designed to limit risk and address the various factors 
for example  we may seek to decrease inventory levels in anticipation of declining ethanol prices and increase inventory levels in anticipation of increasing ethanol prices 
we may also seek to alter our proportion or timing  or both  of purchase and sales commitments 
our limited resources to act upon anticipated factors above and or our inability to anticipate these factors or their relative importance  and adverse movements in the factors themselves  could result in declining or even negative gross profit margins over certain periods of time 
our ability to anticipate those factors or favorable movements in the factors themselves may enable us to generate above average gross profit margins 
however  given the difficulty associated with successfully forecasting any of these factors  we are unable to estimate our future gross profit margins 
results of operations the following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report 
certain performance metrics that we believe are important indicators of our results of operations include years ended december  percentage variance from prior year gallons sold in millions average sales price per gallon corn cost per bushel cbot equivalent co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn average cbot ethanol price per gallon average cbot corn price per bushel we exclude transportation or basis costs in our corn costs to calculate a cbot equivalent in order to more appropriately compare our corn costs to average cbot corn prices 
co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn shows our yield based on sales of wdg generated from ethanol we produced 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results as a percentage dollar percentage of net sales for the years ended variance variance years ended december  favorable favorable december  unfavorable unfavorable dollars in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit loss selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill nm impairment of asset group nm income loss from operations nm other income expense  net loss before noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity and provision for income taxes nm noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss preferred stock dividends deemed dividend on preferred stock nm loss available to common stockholders net sales the increase in our net sales in as compared to was primarily due to a substantial increase in sales volume  coupled with higher average sales prices 
total volume of ethanol sold increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons in as compared to million gallons in the substantial increase in sales volume is primarily due to production at all four of our facilities  two of which were completed in  as well as increased sales volume from our third party ethanol marketing agreements 
during  we completed construction of our stockton and magic valley facilities and in  we completed construction of our columbia facility 
our madera facility has been in operation since october the increased amount of sales from our columbia  magic valley and stockton facilities contributed million to the increase in our net sales for our average sales price per gallon increased to in from an average sales price per gallon of in the average cbot price per gallon increased to in from an average cbot price per gallon of in our average sales price per gallon did not increase as much as the average cbot price per gallon for due to both the timing of our sales and the proportion of our fixed price contracts during a period of rising ethanol prices 
cost of goods sold and gross profit loss our gross margin declined to a negative million for from a positive million for due to higher corn costs 
corn is the single largest component of the cost of our ethanol production and has become a larger portion of our cost of goods sold as we have significantly increased our ethanol production 
overall  the price of corn had a much larger impact on our production costs due to the timing of the corn and the related ethanol pricing from the time we purchase corn to the sale of ethanol 
generally  we fix our corn price upon shipment from the vendor  and in a falling market  our margins are compressed as both corn and ethanol prices continue to fall from transit to processing of the corn 
further  during we experienced unprecedented volatility in the price of corn ranging from the cbot low for the year of to the cbot high for the year of 
these prices moved in such a short period of time that it became difficult to sell the related ethanol production before the prices of both corn and ethanol changed dramatically primarily downward from the time of the corn purchase 
further  due to falling market prices toward the end of  corn and ethanol ending inventories had been purchased and produced  respectively  at prices higher than prevailing spot prices for the commodities at the end of as a result  we recorded additional losses from this market adjustment of approximately million in our sales volume resulting from the marketing and sale of ethanol produced by third parties decreased as an overall percentage of our total net sales  as production of our own ethanol has been growing rapidly 
our purchase and sale prices of ethanol produced by third parties typically fluctuate closely with market prices 
as a result  our average cost of ethanol purchased from third parties increased in line with the overall increase in our average sales price per gallon 
our net derivative losses were  for as compared to losses of  for included in the net losses for are net losses of  related to settled non designated positions 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  increased by million to million for as compared to million for sg a  however  decreased as a percentage of net sales due to our significant sales growth 
the increase in the dollar amount of sg a is primarily due to the following factors payroll and benefits increased by  due to increased administrative staff  bad debt expense increased by  due to growth in accounts receivable and certain customers facing difficult liquidity positions  derivative commissions increased by  due to significant trades during the year  and noncash compensation expense increased by  due to additional restricted stock grant activity during the year 
partially offsetting the foregoing increases were the following decreases professional fees decreased  due to lower consulting fees and temporary staffing during the year  and amortization of intangible assets decreased  primarily resulting from a reduction in amortization expense associated with our acquisition of our ownership interest in front range  as we have fully amortized a significant portion of the intangible assets associated with the acquisition 
impairment of goodwill statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we conducted an impairment test of goodwill as of march  as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of  requiring us to write off our entire goodwill balances from our previous acquisitions of kinergy marketing llc  or kinergy  and front range 
the impairment charge will not result in future cash expenditures 
impairment of asset group in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  as of september   we performed our impairment analysis for our asset group associated with our suspended plant construction project in the imperial valley near calipatria  california  or the imperial project 
at september   the asset group consisted of gross property and equipment of  in addition  the imperial project had construction related accounts payable and accrued expenses of  we do not intend to resume construction of the imperial project 
in november   we began proceedings to liquidate these assets and liabilities 
after assessing the estimated undiscounted cash flows  we recorded an impairment charge of  thereby reducing our property and equipment at september   by that amount 
as conditions in the industry and viable financing options become available  we will assess resuming construction 
to the extent we are relieved of the related liabilities  we may record a gain in the period in which the relief occurs 
other income expense  net other expense decreased by million to million in from other expense of million in the decrease in other expense is primarily due to the following factors increased other income of  primarily related to sales of our business energy tax credits sold as pass through investments to interested purchasers  decreased net mark to market losses of  from our interest rate hedges which required that we mark to market our ineffective positions in a declining interest rate environment  the ineffectiveness related to our interest rate swaps in related primarily to the de designation of our interest rate swaps associated with our debt financing  which is currently being restructured and it is not probable that we will make our required payments as currently structured 
in  we recorded a loss of  primarily resulting from the suspension of construction of our imperial valley project in the fourth quarter of  and decreased finance cost amortization of  related to our prior financing arrangements  which were replaced by our current financing arrangements  requiring accelerated amortization on the prior financing arrangements 
these items were partially offset by interest expense increased by  as we have increased our debt and ceased capitalizing interest associated with our plant construction program  decreased interest income of  due to our use of cash for construction activities over the past year  and increased bank fees of  primarily related to our obtaining waivers for our construction financing debt  due to non compliance at the end of and a requirement that we pay additional bank fees to obtain such waivers during the period 
noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity relates to the consolidated treatment of front range  a variable interest entity  and represents the noncontrolling interest of others in the earnings of front range 
we consolidate the entire income statement of front range for the period covered 
however  because we own only of front range  we must reduce our net income or increase our net loss for the noncontrolling interest  which is the ownership interest that we do not own 
this amount decreased by  to a loss of  in from income of  in primarily due to goodwill impairment associated with amounts recorded in the original acquisition of our interests in front range 
preferred stock dividends shares of our series a and b preferred stock are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends payable in arrears an amount equal to and per annum  respectively  of the purchase price per share of the preferred stock  or  and only in  at our option  payable in additional shares of series a preferred stock based on the value of the purchase price per share of the series a preferred stock 
in  we declared and paid cash dividends on our series a and b preferred stock in the aggregate amounts of  and  respectively 
during  the former holder of our series a preferred stock converted all of its shares of series a preferred stock into shares of our common stock 
as a result  at december   there were no outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
deemed dividend on preferred stock during  we recorded a deemed dividend on preferred stock of  in connection with a subsequent issuance of shares of series b preferred stock 
this non cash dividend reflects the implied economic value to the preferred stockholder of being able to convert the shares into common stock at a price as adjusted for the value allocated to the warrants which was in excess of the fair value of the series b preferred stock at the time of issuance 
the fair value was calculated using the difference between the conversion price of the series b preferred stock into shares of common stock  adjusted for the value allocated to the warrants  of per share and the fair market value of our common stock of on the date of issuance of the series b preferred stock 
the deemed dividend on preferred stock is a reconciling item and adjusts our reported net loss  together with the preferred stock dividends discussed above  to loss available to common stockholders 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  results as a percentage dollar percentage of net sales for the years ended variance variance years ended december  favorable favorable december  unfavorable unfavorable dollars in thousands net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expense  net income loss before noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity and provision for income taxes noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss preferred stock dividends deemed dividend on preferred stock loss available to common stockholders net sales the increase in our net sales in as compared to was primarily due to a substantial increase in sales volume  which was partially offset by decreased average sales prices 
total volume of ethanol sold increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons in as compared to million gallons in the substantial increase in sales volume is primarily due to a full year of ethanol production at our madera and front range facilities in our madera and front range facilities each accounted for less than three months of ethanol production in in addition  in  we commenced ethanol production at our columbia facility and also generated increased sales from the purchase and resale of additional supply from third parties under our ethanol marketing agreements 
the production and sale of ethanol and its co products from our madera and columbia facilities  and through front range  contributed an aggregate of million to our increase in net sales in our average sales price per gallon declined to in from an average sales price per gallon of in the average cbot price per gallon declined to in from an average cbot price per gallon of in we believe that we were insulated from some of this decline due to our fixed price ethanol contracts which were partially offset by derivative losses incurred as a result of locking in margins 
cost of goods sold and gross profit the increase in our cost of goods sold in as compared to was predominantly due to increased sales volume and increased corn costs which contributed to higher costs per gallon 
our gross margin declined to in from in primarily due to increased corn costs  lower average sales prices per gallon and losses on derivatives  as further discussed below 
although a large proportion of our sales volume results from the marketing and sale of ethanol produced by third parties  production of our own ethanol began growing rapidly in as new facilities commenced operations 
our purchase and sale prices of ethanol produced by third parties typically fluctuate closely with market prices 
as a result  our average cost of ethanol purchased from third parties decreased in line with the overall decline in our average sales price per gallon 
corn is the single largest component of the cost of our ethanol production 
average corn prices rose significantly in as compared to  with greater increases occurring in the second half of than in the first half of the year 
these increases pushed our average corn price higher than the average market price for all of because our corn requirements increased significantly during the second half of due to the commencement of operations at our columbia facility in september overall  the price of corn had a much larger impact on our production costs per gallon in than in due to the higher proportion of sales from production of our own ethanol in as compared to cost of goods sold also increased by  from net losses on derivatives in as compared to only a nominal amount in these losses resulted from derivatives that we entered in order to lock in margins during the year and were partially offset by gains from derivatives we entered in order to lock in the price of corn 
of these losses   was related to open positions at december  selling  general and administrative expenses our sg a increased by  to  for as compared to  for sg a  however  decreased as a percentage of net sales due to our significant sales growth 
the increase in the dollar amount of sg a is primarily due to the following factors payroll and benefits increased by  or  due to increased administrative staff  amortization of intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of our ownership interest in front range increased by  as we incurred a full year of amortization compared to less than three months in  sg a attributable to front range increased by  as we incurred a full year of these expenses as compared to less than three months in consulting and temporary staff expenses increased by  or  due to the retention of additional consulting and temporary staff personnel to assist us in meeting our accounting and public reporting requirements  including as we transitioned our permanent staff to our new corporate headquarters in sacramento  california  these consulting and temporary staff personnel also assisted us in training new administrative staff members  recruiting  hiring and training expenses increased by  or  employee travel and office setup costs increased by  or  and rent expense increased by  or  each of these increases resulted primarily from the relocation of our corporate headquarters in early from fresno to sacramento  external audit costs increased by  or  due to our overall growth and business initiatives  and travel related costs increased by  or  due to expanded operations and new office and facility locations 
partially offsetting the foregoing increases were the following decreases non cash compensation expense decreased by  or  due to the completion of vesting of incentive compensation paid to employees and consultants  legal expenses decreased by  or  primarily due to one time costs associated with greater legal activity from litigation and business transactions that occurred in  and costs associated with implementing and testing our internal controls and related compliance required under the sarbanes oxley act of decreased by  or  as many costs that occurred in were related predominantly to our initial implementation and testing of our internal controls 
other income expense  net other expense increased by  to  in from other income of  in the increase in other expense is primarily due to the following factors interest expense increased by  or  due to additional borrowings and a full year of interest accruing on outstanding debt  and amortization of interest and financing costs increased by  or  primarily due to an amendment to our construction financing credit facility that reduced its application from five to four facilities and reduced the total amount of available financing  as a result  we wrote off  of unamortized costs associated with our imperial valley facility  the construction of which had been suspended  interest and financing costs incurred under the construction phase of each of our facilities which were being capitalized until the corresponding facility became operational  this increase in amortization of interest and financing costs is net of approximately  of additional capitalized amounts over in addition  we recognized losses of  and  of effective and ineffectiveness positions  respectively  from our interest rate hedges which required that we mark to market our ineffective positions in a declining interest rate environment 
the ineffectiveness related to our interest rate swaps and primarily resulted from the suspension of construction of our imperial valley facility 
noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity relates to the consolidated treatment of front range  a variable interest entity  and represents the noncontrolling interest of others in the earnings of front range 
we consolidate the entire income statement of front range for the period covered 
however  because we own only of front range  we must reduce our net income or increase our net loss for the noncontrolling interest  which is the ownership interest that we do not own 
this amount increased by  to  in from  in due to the consolidation of front range s operations for all of as compared to less than three months in preferred stock dividends shares of our series a preferred stock are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends payable in arrears in cash in an amount equal to per annum of the purchase price per share of the series a preferred stock  or  at the time  our option  payable in additional shares of series a preferred stock based on the value of the purchase price per share of the series a preferred stock

deemed dividend on preferred stock we recorded a deemed dividend on preferred stock of  for in connection with our issuance of shares of series a preferred stock as a dividend payment in kind for the fourth quarter 
we also recorded a deemed dividend on preferred stock of  for in connection with our initial issuance of shares of series a preferred stock 
these non cash dividends reflect the implied economic value to the preferred stockholder of being able to convert these additional shares into common stock at prices which were in excess of the fair value of the series a preferred stock at the times of issuance 
the fair value was calculated using the difference between the agreed upon conversion price of the series a preferred stock into shares of common stock of per share and the fair market value of our common stock of and on the date of issuance of the additional shares of series a preferred stock for and  respectively 
the fair value allocated to the initial issuance of the series a preferred stock in was in excess of the gross proceeds received of  in connection with the initial sale of the series a preferred stock  however  the deemed dividend on the series a preferred stock for is limited to the gross proceeds received of  the deemed dividend on preferred stock is a reconciling item and adjusts our reported net loss  together with the preferred stock dividends discussed above  to loss available to common stockholders 
liquidity and capital resources overview and outlook our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as a result of ethanol industry conditions that have negatively affected our business  we do not currently have sufficient liquidity to meet our anticipated working capital  debt service and other liquidity needs in the very near term 
we have suspended operations at three of our four wholly owned ethanol production facilities due to market conditions and in an effort to conserve capital 
we have also taken and expect to take additional steps to preserve liquidity 
however  despite any additional cost saving steps we may take  we believe that we have sufficient working capital to continue operations only until approximately april  at the latest unless we successfully restructure our debt  experience a significant improvement in margins and obtain other sources of liquidity 
we are in default under our construction related term loans in the aggregate amount of approximately million and under kinergy s revolving line of credit as well as million in notes payable to another lender 
in february  we entered into forbearance agreements with each of the lenders  which were amended in march  under which the lenders agreed to forbear from exercising their rights until april  absent further defaults 
although we are actively pursuing a number of alternatives  including seeking to restructure our debt and seeking to raise additional debt or equity financing  or both  there can be no assurance that we will be successful 
if we cannot restructure our debt and obtain sufficient liquidity in the very near term  we may need to seek protection under the us bankruptcy code 
quantitative year end liquidity status we believe that the following amounts provide insight into our liquidity and capital resources 
the following selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report dollars in thousands as of and for the year ended december  variance current assets current liabilities property and equipment  net notes payable  net of current portion cash provided by used in operating activities working capital working capital ratio change in working capital and cash flows working capital decreased to a deficit of  at december  from a deficit of  at december  as a result of a significant increase in current liabilities of  and a slight decrease in current assets of  current liabilities significantly increased primarily due to an increase in current portion of debt of  as plant financing and operating lines of credit are both in default and under forbearance agreements with the related lenders  as new terms are being negotiated 
other increases in current liabilities are due to an increase in accrued liabilities of  which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities construction related of  a decrease in trade accounts payable of  a decrease in retentions of  and a decrease in short term note payable of  as that note was paid off by the end of the year and a decrease in derivative liabilities of current assets decreased primarily due to net decreases in marketable securities and accounts receivable of  and  respectively  the proceeds of which were predominantly used for operations  which were partially offset by an increase in cash and equivalents of  and restricted cash of  cash used in our operating activities of  resulted primarily from a loss of  noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity of  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  partially offset by impairment of goodwill of  impairment of asset group of  depreciation and amortization of intangibles of  and changes in other assets and liabilities 
cash used in our investing activities of  resulted primarily from purchases of additional property and equipment of  partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of  cash provided by our financing activities of  resulted primarily from proceeds from our debt financing and lines of credit of  proceeds from issuances of preferred and common stock of  which were partially offset by cash paid for principal debt payments of  preferred share dividends of  debt issuance costs of  and dividend payments to noncontrolling interests of  changes in other assets and liabilities goodwill  net  decreased to at december  from  at december  primarily as a result of our annual impairment analysis which caused us to write the balance down due to a lower current valuation as compared to the original purchase that created the goodwill 
notes payable  net of current portion  decreased to  at december  from  at december  primarily as a result of an increase from loan proceeds used for construction activities at our ethanol plants which were completed in  which increase was partially offset by amounts reclassified to current liabilities as the loans and kinergy s operating line of credit are both in default but presently under a forbearance agreement with the related lenders 
debt financing upon completion of our stockton facility  our construction loans totaling million converted to term loans with scheduled quarterly principal and interest payments due starting on december  we made the first payment at the end of we have been unable to make subsequent required principal and interest payments on these term loans  resulting in defaults under those loans 
in february   we obtained a waiver and forbearance agreement with our lenders which was extended in march the waiver and forbearance agreement  as extended  provides that the lenders will forbear from exercising their rights and remedies under the debt financing commencing february  and ending on april  further the waiver and forbearance agreement provides that we may withdraw funds otherwise required to be reserved in two accounts designated solely for the stockton facility and the other for future debt service payments 
the use of these funds provides approximately  million to us for operating activities 
further  the lenders have allowed us to cease payments of principal and interest due during the forbearance period 
upon expiration of the forbearance period  or our earlier default under the terms of the forbearance  we will be required to repay all outstanding amounts owed to our lenders

kinergy line of credit in february  kinergy determined that it had violated certain of its covenants  including its financial covenant for in february  we entered into an amendment and forbearance agreement with our lender which was further amended in march the amendment identified certain defaults under the loan agreement as to which the lender agreed to forebear from exercising its rights and remedies commencing february  through april  during the forbearance period  kinergy s lender has authorized us to use this line of credit for kinergy s operations 
the agreement reduced the aggregate amount of the credit facility from up to  to up to the agreement also increased the interest rates applicable to the loan 
kinergy may borrow under the credit facility based upon i a rate equal to a the london interbank offered rate libor  divided by subject to change based upon the reserve percentage in effect from time to time under regulation d of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  plus b depending on the amount of kinergy s ebitda for a specified period  or ii a rate equal to a the greater of the prime rate published by wachovia bank from time to time  or the federal funds rate then in effect plus  plus b depending on the amount of kinergy s ebitda for a specified period 
in addition  kinergy is required to pay an unused line fee at a rate equal to as well as other customary fees and expenses associated with the credit facility and issuances of letters of credit

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
going concern assumption we have based our financial statements on the assumption of our operations continuing as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of the recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our existence 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured in conformity with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of ethanol and related co products 
we recognize revenue when title transfers to our customers  which is generally upon the delivery of these products to a customer s designated location 
these deliveries are made in accordance with sales commitments and related sales orders entered into with customers either verbally or in written form 
the sales commitments and related sales orders provide quantities  pricing and conditions of sales 
in this regard  we engage in three basic types of revenue generating transactions as a producer 
sales as a producer consist of sales of our inventory produced at our facilities 
as a merchant 
sales as a merchant consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which we may or may not obtain physical control of the ethanol or co products  though ultimately titled to us  in which shipments are directed from our suppliers to our terminals or direct to our customers but for which we accept the risk of loss in the transactions 
as an agent 
sales as an agent consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which  depending upon the terms of the transactions  title to the product may technically pass to us  but the risk and rewards of inventory ownership remains with third party suppliers as we receive a predetermined service fee under these transactions and therefore act predominantly in an agency capacity 
we have employed the principles detailed in emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  as guidance in our revenue recognition policies 
revenue from sales of third party ethanol and its co products is recorded net of costs when we are acting as an agent between the customer and supplier and gross when we are a principal to the transaction 
several factors are considered to determine whether we are acting as an agent or principal  most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer  whether we have inventory risk and related risk of loss or whether we add meaningful value to the vendor s product or service 
consideration is also given to whether we have latitude in establishing the sales price or have credit risk  or both 
we record revenues based upon the gross amounts billed to our customers in transactions where we act as a producer or a merchant and obtain title to ethanol and its co products and therefore own the product and any related  unmitigated inventory risk for the ethanol  regardless of whether we actually obtain physical control of the product 
when we act in an agency capacity  we record revenues on a net basis  or our predetermined agency fees only  based upon the amount of net revenues retained in excess of amounts paid to suppliers 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
we have determined that front range meets the definition of a variable interest entity under the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb s  financial interpretation no  or fin  r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
we have also determined that we are the primary beneficiary and we are therefore required to treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes rather than use equity investment accounting treatment 
as a result  we have consolidated the financial results of front range  including its entire balance sheet with the balance of the noncontrolling interest displayed between liabilities and equity  and the income statement after intercompany eliminations with an adjustment for the noncontrolling interest in net income since our acquisition on october  under fin r  and as long as we are deemed the primary beneficiary of front range  we must treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets our intangible assets  including goodwill  were derived from the acquisition of our interest in front range in and our acquisition of kinergy in in connection with the share exchange transaction 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocated the respective purchase prices to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase prices over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded as goodwill 
our long lived assets are primarily associated with our ethanol production facilities 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with sfas no 
we review these assets at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in our review  we determine the fair value of these assets using market multiples and discounted cash flow modeling and compare it to the net book value of the acquired assets 
any assessed impairments will be recorded permanently and expensed in the period in which the impairment is determined 
if it is determined through our assessment process that any of our intangible assets require impairment charges  they will be recorded in the line item other operating charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended december   we performed our annual review of impairment and recognized an impairment loss of  the entire amount of our goodwill 
we did not recognize any impairment losses for the years ended december  and we evaluate impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that suggest the fair value of assets could be less then their net book value 
in such event  we assess long lived assets for impairment by determining their fair value based on the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate plus the net proceeds expected from the sale of the asset 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the related asset s net book value  and an impairment expense would be recorded in the amount of the difference 
forecasts of future cash flows are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations and the industries in which we operate 
these forecasts could be significantly affected by future changes in market conditions  the economic environment  including inflation  deflation and capital spending decisions of our customers 
during the year ended december   we recognized an impairment loss on long lived assets associated with our imperial valley ethanol production facility  which construction has been suspended  of  we did not recognize any impairment losses for the years ended december  and in  we completed construction of our ethanol production facilities  with installed capacity of million gallons per year  our goal since during  we  along with the ethanol industry as a whole  experienced significant volatility in the prices of ethanol and corn 
further  we incurred significant operating losses in the last half of  which required us to make decisions about operating levels at each of our facilities 
as a result  beginning in december and through the first quarter of  we reduced our production 
currently we have ceased production at our madera  magic valley and stockton facilities 
we continue to operate our columbia and front range facilities 
we continue to assess market conditions and when appropriate and with adequate available working capital  we plan to bring these facilities back to operation 
given the national renewable fuel standards requirements of ethanol  we believe the ethanol industry is viable and will recover in the near term 
at december   we performed our forecast of expected future cash flows of our facilities over their estimated useful lives 
such forecasts of expected future cash flows are heavily dependent upon management s estimates of future market prices for ethanol  our primary product  and corn  our primary production input 
as both ethanol and corn costs have fluctuated significantly in the past year  these estimates are highly subjective and are management s best estimates at this time 
management developed estimated future prices consistent with market forecasts  including forecasts from the united states department of agriculture s long term forecast 
our forecasts assume that our facilities will only operate during periods when market price conditions yield acceptable operating margins 
our analysis resulted in total estimated undiscounted cash flows over the expected lives of our plant assets in excess of their carrying values 
as a result  we did not determine the fair value of our facilities 
if average prices for ethanol and corn were used in our forecast rather than management s estimate of future market prices  the projections would have resulted in estimated undiscounted cash flows below carrying values which would require us to compute their fair values 
if we are required to compute the fair value in the future  we may use the work of a qualified valuation specialist who would assist us in examining replacement costs  recent transactions between third parties and cash flow that can be generated from operations 
given the recent completion of the facilities  replacement cost would likely approximate the carrying value of the facilities 
however  there have been recent transactions between independent parties to purchase plants at prices substantially below the carrying value of the facilities 
some of the facilities have been in bankruptcy and may not be representative of transactions outside of bankruptcy 
given these circumstances  should management be required to adjust the carrying value of the facilities to fair value at some future point in time  the adjustment could be significant and could significantly impact our financial position  results of operation and possibly any existing financial debt covenants 
no adjustment has been made in these financial statements for this uncertainty 
derivative instruments and hedging activities our business and activities expose us to a variety of market risks  including risks related to changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we monitor and manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our risk management program 
this program recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility could have on operating results 
we account for our use of derivatives related to our hedging activities pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in which we recognize all of our derivative instruments in our statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities  depending on the rights or obligations under the contracts 
we have designated and documented contracts for the physical delivery of commodity products to and from counterparties as normal purchases and normal sales 
derivative instruments are measured at fair value  pursuant to the definition found in sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s effective gains and losses to be deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and later recorded together with the gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the statements of operations 
companies must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the estimated gains losses on our derivatives were as follows in thousands year ended december  commodity futures interest rate options total allowance for doubtful accounts we primarily sell ethanol to gasoline refining and distribution companies and wdg to dairy operators and animal feed distributors 
we had significant concentrations of credit risk from sales of our ethanol as of december   as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  those ethanol customers historically have had good credit ratings and historically we have collected amounts that were billed to those customers 
receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and actively pursue collections on past due balances 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for balances that appear to have specific collection issues 
our collection process is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with the customer at specified intervals 
if after a specified number of days  we have been unsuccessful in our collection efforts  we consider recording a bad debt allowance for the balance in question 
we would eventually write off accounts included in our allowance when we have determined that collection is not likely 
the factors considered in reaching this determination are the apparent financial condition of the customer  and our success in contacting and negotiating with the customer 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized   and  respectively  in bad debt expenses as a result of this policy 
costs of start up activities start up activities are defined broadly in statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  as those one time activities related to opening a new facility  introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  conducting business with a new class of customer or beneficiary  initiating a new process in an existing facility  commencing some new operation or activities related to organizing a new entity 
our start up activities consist primarily of costs associated with new or potential sites for ethanol production facilities 
we expense all the costs associated with a potential site  until the site is considered viable by management  at which time costs would be considered for capitalization based on authoritative accounting literature 
these costs are included in selling  general  and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions involving financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
commodity risk cash flow hedges as part of our risk management strategy  we use derivative instruments to protect cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in commodity prices for periods of up to twelve months 
these hedging activities are conducted to protect gross margins to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility could have on operating results by minimizing our exposure to price volatility on ethanol sale and purchase commitments where the price is to be set at a future date and or if the contract specifies a floating or index based price for ethanol that is based on either the new york mercantile exchange price of gasoline or the chicago board of trade price of ethanol 
in addition  we hedge anticipated sales of ethanol to minimize our exposure to the potentially adverse effects of price volatility 
these derivatives are designated and documented as sfas no 
cash flow hedges and effectiveness is evaluated by assessing the probability of the anticipated transactions and regressing commodity futures prices against our purchase and sales prices 
ineffectiveness  which is defined as the degree to which the derivative does not offset the underlying exposure  is recognized immediately in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   a loss from ineffectiveness in the amount of  and an effective gain in the amount of  were recorded in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   a gain from ineffectiveness in the amount of  and an effective loss in the amount of  were recorded in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   losses from ineffectiveness in the amount of  and an effective loss in the amount of  were recorded in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   an effective gain in the amount of  was recorded in sales

commodity risk non designated derivatives as part of our risk management strategy  we use forward contracts on corn  crude oil and reformulated blendstock for oxygenate blending gasoline to lock in prices for certain amounts of corn  denaturant and ethanol  respectively 
these derivatives are not designated under sfas no 
for special hedge accounting treatment 
the changes in fair value of these contracts are recorded on the balance sheet and recognized immediately in cost of goods sold 
we recognized losses of  of which  is related to settled non designated hedges   and as the change in the fair value of these contracts for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the notional balances remaining on the contracts as of december  and were  and  respectively 
interest rate risk as part of our interest rate risk management strategy  we use derivative instruments to minimize significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from rising variable interest rate costs associated with existing and anticipated borrowings 
to meet these objectives we purchased interest rate caps and swaps 
the rate for notional balances of interest rate caps ranging from  to  is per annum 
the rate for notional balances of interest rate swaps ranging from  to  is per annum 
these derivatives are designated and documented as sfas no 
cash flow hedges and effectiveness is evaluated by assessing the probability of anticipated interest expense and regressing the historical value of the rates against the historical value in the existing and anticipated debt 
ineffectiveness  reflecting the degree to which the derivative does not offset the underlying exposure  is recognized immediately in other income expense 
for the year ended december   gains from ineffectiveness in the amount of  gains from effectiveness in the amount of  and losses from undesignated hedges in the amount of  were recorded in other income expense 
these gains and losses resulted from our efforts to restructure our debt financing and therefore  making it not probable that the related borrowings would be paid as designated 
as such we de designated certain of our interest rate caps and swaps 
for the year ended december   losses from ineffectiveness in the amount of  losses from effectiveness in the amount of  and losses from undesignated hedges in the amount of  were recorded in other income expense 
for the year ended december   ineffectiveness in the amount of  was recorded in other income expense 
we marked all of our derivative instruments to fair value at each period end  except for those derivative contracts which qualified for the normal purchase and sale exemption pursuant to sfas no

if the underlying items were included in the analysis  the gains or losses on the futures contracts may be offset 
actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not generally under our control and could vary significantly from the factors disclosed 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments  as well as credit or performance risk with respect to our hedged customers commitments 
although nonperformance is possible  we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of these parties
