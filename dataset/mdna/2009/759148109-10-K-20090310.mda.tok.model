item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in the following three business segments  which are managed separately based on fundamental differences in operations program management services  hospitals and other healthcare services 
program management services include hospital rehabilitation services including inpatient acute and subacute rehabilitation and outpatient therapy programs and contract therapy programs which focus primarily on rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities 
our hospitals segment owns and operates six inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and five long term acute care hospitals ltachs 
our other healthcare services segment provides healthcare management consulting services and staffing services for therapists and nurses 
effective august   the company completed the sale of equipment  goodwill  other intangible assets and certain related assets associated with its bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital located in midland  texas the midland hospital to healthsouth corporation for million less direct selling costs 
this transaction was the result of a strategic review of the midland odessa market 
the midland hospital has been classified as a discontinued operation pursuant to the requirements of fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
prior year comparative amounts throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been adjusted to reflect the treatment of the midland hospital as a discontinued operation

a portion of our revenues in this segment are derived from our direct bill contract therapy rehab agencies 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy services are typically provided under one to two year agreements primarily with skilled nursing facilities 
in our hospitals segment  we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees for patient care services  which are usually paid for or reimbursed by medicare  medicaid or third party managed care programs

contract therapy 
contract therapy revenues increased million from to same store revenues grew reflecting a increase in same store minutes of service 
the same store revenue growth more than offset the impact of a decline in the average number of locations operated during higher average daily census and improved productivity contributed to the growth in same store revenues and same store minutes of service 
hospital rehabilitation services hrs 
hrs operating revenues increased in as inpatient revenue increased and outpatient revenue declined 
the increase in inpatient revenue reflects a increase in average revenue per program  partially offset by a decline in the average number of units operated 
same store acute rehabilitation discharges increased in as the division s units were able to increase patient volumes in following the january  effective date of the freeze in the rule s compliance threshold 
the decline in outpatient revenue reflects a decline in the average number of units operated  partially offset by a increase in average revenue per program 
outpatient same store revenues grew in hospitals 
hospitals segment revenues increased million from to the increase in revenues reflects the acquisition of the specialty hospital in rome  georgia effective june  and a full year of operations of our inpatient rehabilitation hospital in austin  texas  which received its medicare provider number in november the hospital segment also opened an ltach in kansas city  missouri in april and a rehabilitation hospital in st 
louis  missouri in november same store revenues increased by million or in as compared to our inpatient rehabilitation hospital in amarillo  texas  which was in its ramp up phase in the first quarter of  contributed million to the same store revenue growth 
we define the ramp up phase as the period during which a recently opened hospital builds its patient census following the receipt of its medicare provider number 
other healthcare services 
other healthcare services segment revenues declined million in compared to this decline in revenues occurred primarily in our phase consulting business  which experienced more difficulty selling services to new clients in in part due to the slowdown in our nation s economy 
cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of assets depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses operating expenses increased slightly as a percentage of revenues as a decline in earnings realized by our hospital segment was mostly offset by improved operating performance from our contract therapy division 
both variances are discussed further below 
the increase in corporate selling  general and administrative expenses reflects the costs of severance benefits incurred in  an increase in share based compensation and other management incentive costs and an investment in back office resources to support the current year and expected future growth of our hospital segment 
these cost increases were partially offset by the cost savings achieved from closing symphony s corporate office in hunt valley  maryland at the end of june the hospital segment incurred a million impairment charge in as discussed in more detail below 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to lower amortization associated with capitalized software and intangible assets which became fully amortized in and the company s provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses 
on a consolidated basis  the provision for doubtful accounts increased by million from to the provisions recorded by our phase consulting business and hospital rehabilitation services hrs business increased by million and million  respectively  in for phase  the increased provision is primarily related to the write off of a receivable from a large client hospital 
this write off followed a failed attempt to mediate a dispute with the hospital 
for hrs  the increased provision is primarily related to the company s trade and note receivables due from signature healthcare foundation as a result of signature s deteriorating financial condition during see notes and to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information on the signature matter 
we consider both of these bad debt items to be isolated to the specific circumstances of the respective clients and not as events indicative of a greater level of risk in the broader portfolio of accounts receivable of these businesses 
the increased provisions for phase and hrs were partially offset by a million decrease for our contract therapy business 
this decrease reflects the results of a concerted focus on collection activities and our efforts over the past two years to improve the quality of the division s portfolio of accounts receivable

total contract therapy costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased in primarily due to operational efficiencies and cost savings achieved from completing the integration of symphony and closing symphony s corporate office in hunt valley  maryland at the end of june direct operating expenses declined as a percentage of unit revenue reflecting the combined impact of continued efficiencies realized from the integration of the former rehabworks units and improved therapist productivity throughout the division 
labor and benefit costs per minute of service declined by in as therapist productivity improvements during more than offset the impact of wage rate increases 
division and corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of unit revenue primarily due to synergies achieved from the integration of the symphony business 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily because capitalized software assets associated with the symphony acquisition became fully amortized in the fourth quarter of contract therapy s operating earnings were million in compared to million in hospital rehabilitation services hrs 
total hrs costs and expenses as a percentage of unit revenue increased in primarily due to an increase in direct operating expenses 
direct operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue reflecting an increase in professional liability expense due to favorable reserve adjustments recognized in and the increase in the provision for doubtful accounts explained above 
corporate selling  general and administrative expenses increased reflecting increases in legal expense  share based compensation expense and other management incentive costs 
the increased legal expense in primarily related to the proposed settlement of a wage and hour lawsuit in california 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to lower depreciation and amortization associated with capitalized software and other fixed assets which became fully depreciated 
total hospital rehabilitation services operating earnings were million in compared to million in hospitals 
total hospital segment costs and expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue in despite the recognition of a million impairment loss in this impairment loss reduced the carrying value of an intangible asset to its revised estimate of fair value based on the impact of a change in ltach regulations issued by cms on may  operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue in primarily due to increased start up and ramp up losses and a decline in earnings from our mature hospitals  including our clear lake  texas hospital which was significantly impacted by hurricane ike 
the division incurred start up losses of million in primarily related to the development of an ltach in kansas city 
start up losses were million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased from the prior year period reflecting an investment in back office resources to support the growth in the business expected in and a million charge to expense in of previously deferred direct acquisition costs related to our decision to discontinue efforts to acquire a controlling interest in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in rhode island 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in primarily due to depreciation and amortization associated with our newest facilities 
as a result of these factors  the hospitals segment incurred operating losses of million in and million in other healthcare services 
the other healthcare services segment generated operating earnings of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in operating earnings is mainly attributable to our phase consulting business and reflects the decrease in revenues and the increase in provision for doubtful accounts discussed earlier 
non operating items interest income decreased from million in to million in primarily due to the recognition of million of interest income in related to a federal income tax refund claim 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in primarily due to both a reduction in interest rates and a reduction in average total debt outstanding 
the balance outstanding on our revolving credit facility was million and million at december  and  respectively 
interest expense also includes interest on subordinated promissory notes issued as partial consideration for various acquisitions completed over the last three years  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit  and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit 
minority interests in net losses of consolidated affiliates increased to million in from million in this increase is primarily due to the recognition of the noncontrolling interests share of the losses incurred by our ltach in kansas city

the company incurred losses from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the losses in relate to the operations of rehabcare rehabilitation hospital permian basin  a bed inpatient rehabilitation hospital located in midland  texas the midland hospital partially offset by a net gain of million recognized on the sale of that hospital effective august  the losses in relate entirely to the operations of the midland hospital

contract therapy revenues increased million from million in to million in this revenue growth reflects the acquisition of symphony s rehabworks business  which contributed incremental revenues of million in legacy contract therapy revenues increased by million primarily due to a increase in same store revenues and a increase in average revenue per minute of service  which more than offset a reduction in the average number of legacy contract therapy locations operated during the year over year same store revenue growth of was an improvement over the same store growth rate achieved in same store revenue growth in was negatively affected by the part b therapy caps that went into place on january  and had a significant impact on part b revenues in the first half of hospital rehabilitation services hrs 
hrs operating revenues declined in as inpatient revenue declined and outpatient revenue declined 
the decline in inpatient revenue reflects a decline in the average number of units operated in same store acute rehabilitation revenues and discharges were down and  respectively  compared to the rule continued to impact our unit level census and the number of discharges in as patients with diagnoses outside of the qualifying diagnoses were treated at other patient care settings 
the decline in outpatient revenue reflects a decline in the average number of units operated  partially offset by a increase in outpatient same store revenues 
hospitals 
hospitals segment revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in revenues in reflects the mid acquisition of louisiana specialty hospital  the october opening of a rehabilitation hospital in amarillo  texas and the august opening of a majority owned rehabilitation hospital in austin  texas 
the increase in revenues also reflects year over year same store revenue growth of million or 
approximately million of this revenue growth is attributable to favorable adjustments to net liabilities for prior year medicare and medicaid cost reports assumed in the acquisition of the four meadowbrook hospitals 
other healthcare services 
other healthcare services segment revenues were million in compared to million in this revenue change is primarily due to the july  acquisition of symphony s therapist and nurse staffing business and skilled nursing consulting business 
cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of assets restructuring depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues in due to the overall shift in revenue mix toward our contract therapy and hospital businesses  which tend to have lower operating margins than our hospital rehabilitation services business 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was partially mitigated by a million decrease in professional liability expense and a million decrease in workers compensation expense in these decreases  which primarily affect our operating divisions that provide patient care  reflect a favorable change in the company s actuarial estimates of ultimate expected losses on both claims incurred and reported and claims incurred but not reported 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflects greater leveraging of these expenses with the july  acquisition of symphony and cost savings achieved from closing symphony s corporate office in hunt valley  maryland at the end of june the hospitals segment incurred a million impairment charge in as discussed in more detail below 
depreciation and amortization increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of symphony 
the company s provision for doubtful accounts is included in operating expenses 
on a consolidated basis  the provision for doubtful accounts increased by million from million in to million in this increase is primarily attributable to incremental bad debt expense for the symphony businesses 
of the million year over year increase  million is attributable to incremental provisions for doubtful accounts for the rehabworks contract therapy business which was acquired in the symphony transaction on july  during  the provision for doubtful accounts attributable to the rehabworks business was a greater percentage of revenue than the historical levels for our legacy contract therapy business 
we concluded that an incremental provision for doubtful accounts for rehabworks receivables was warranted in primarily based on our assessment of the collection risk of several larger clients where we terminated services and our assessment of the overall risk in the portfolio of rehabworks receivables

total contract therapy costs and expenses increased in primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses associated with the acquisition of symphony s rehabworks business 
contract therapy s direct operating expenses as a percentage of unit revenue decreased from in to in mainly as a result of productivity improvements achieved in both the legacy contract therapy and the rehabworks businesses 
driving the large productivity improvements in the rehabworks business was the completion of the conversion of all rehabworks sites to the same systems and processes that are in place in the legacy contract therapy business 
the division s productivity improvements helped offset the effect of an increase in the division s provision for doubtful accounts  as previously discussed  and an increase in employee incentive costs  which was largely due to the conversion of all rehabworks employees to rehabcare s incentive plan on january  division and corporate selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of unit revenue reflecting the cost benefit of the synergies achieved in the integration of the symphony business as well as cost savings achieved from closing symphony s corporate office in hunt valley at the end of june depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the july  acquisition of symphony 
contract therapy s operating earnings were million in compared to a loss of million in hospital rehabilitation services hrs 
total hospital rehabilitation services costs and expenses declined from to primarily due to declines in both direct operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
direct operating expenses declined as average units in operation fell 
the division s direct operating expenses as a percentage of unit revenue increased slightly from in to in as an increase in bad debt expense and a decline in therapist productivity  particularly in our outpatient business  was largely offset by a decrease in professional liability and workers compensation expense 
fiscal year bad debt expense in this division was lower than historical levels primary due to several recoveries of accounts previously turned over to attorneys for collection 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from to reflecting efforts to control costs and a greater leveraging of these expenses across the company with the acquisition of symphony 
total hospital rehabilitation services operating earnings were million in compared to million in hospitals 
total hospital costs and expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue in primarily due to the recognition of an impairment loss on an intangible asset 
the segment recognized an impairment loss of million in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of an intangible asset to its revised estimate of fair value based on the impact of a change in ltach regulations issued by cms on may  note to the consolidated financial statements contains additional background information regarding the impairment loss 
the division incurred start up losses of approximately million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the start up losses in relate primarily to our majority owned austin  texas joint venture 
division selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of unit revenue increased from the prior year reflecting efforts to grow this segment  the reallocation of certain resources from our other divisions and an investment in back office resources to support the growth in the division expected in depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of louisiana specialty hospital and the depreciation of leasehold improvements in our rehabilitation hospitals in amarillo  texas and austin  texas 
as a result of these factors  the hospitals segment generated an operating loss of million in compared to operating earnings of million in other healthcare services 
operating earnings for the other healthcare services segment increased from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to the improved operating performance of our phase consulting  inc phase business 
non operating items interest income increased from million in to million in primarily due to the recognition of million of interest income in related to a federal income tax refund claim  which was partially offset by a decline in interest income earned on average cash and investment balances 
interest expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to the increase in borrowings against our revolving credit facility which occurred in connection with funding of the mid acquisitions of symphony and memorial rehabilitation hospital midland 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility was million 
interest expense also includes interest on subordinated promissory notes issued as partial consideration for various acquisitions completed over the last three years  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit  and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit 
equity in net income loss of affiliates was million in and million in during the first quarter of  we elected to abandon our equity interest in intelistaf holdings and therefore wrote off the remaining million carrying value of our investment in that entity 
the remainder of the year over year variance is the result of improved operating performance by our owned rehabilitation hospital in kokomo  indiana 
earnings from continuing operations before income taxes increased to million in from million in the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in is principally the result of not recognizing a full tax benefit for the equity losses from non consolidated affiliates 
the company incurred losses from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
such losses relate entirely to the operations of the midland hospital 
net earnings were million in compared to million in diluted earnings per share were in compared to in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and a current ratio  the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities  of to net working capital increased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  principally due to a million year over year increase in cash and cash equivalents 
net accounts receivable were million at december   compared to million at december  the number of days sales outstanding dso in net receivables was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily due to the increase in revenues in the improvement in dso occurred primarily in our contract therapy division and reflects the results of a concerted focus on collection activities and our efforts over the past two years to improve the quality of the division s portfolio of accounts receivable 
we generated cash from operations of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash from operations of million for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable 
delays in receiving medicare and medicaid reimbursements and a temporary shift in focus from collection activities to symphony integration activities contributed to the increase in accounts receivable 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to the construction of new hospitals  investments in information technology systems  equipment additions and replacements and various other capital improvements 
over the next few years  we plan to continue to invest in information technology systems and the development and renovation of hospitals 
the company has historically financed its operations with funds generated from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities and long term debt instruments 
we believe our cash on hand  cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our future working capital  capital expenditures  internal and external business expansion  and debt service requirements 
we have a million  five year revolving credit facility  dated june   with million outstanding as of december  at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the revolving credit facility is expandable to million  subject to the approval of the lending group and subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the credit agreement 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit issued to insurance carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims 
the letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   after consideration of the effects of restrictive covenants  the available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was approximately million 
inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole 
our management contracts often provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to us by our clients based on increases in various inflation indices 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein by reference 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than total year years years years other operating leases purchase obligations long term debt interest on long term debt fin liability other long term liabilities total we lease many of our facilities under non cancelable operating leases in the normal course of business 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
for more information  see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
for the purpose of computing the interest payments shown here  we have assumed a constant balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility of million through june   which is the date on which our credit facility expires 
this also assumes our contracts under the revolving credit facility are renewed at the currently existing rates of interest 
represents our total liability for unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our fin liabilities  which involve various taxing authorities 
as a result  we are unable to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees 
under the plan  participants may defer up to of their salary and cash incentive compensation 
the amounts are held in trust in investments designated by participants but remain our property until distribution 
because most distributions of funds are tied to the termination of employment or retirement of participants  we are not able to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
at december   we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating contractual allowances  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health  workers compensation and professional liability claims 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
our estimates of collectability require significant judgment 
if our customers ability to make payments to us were to deteriorate beyond the levels estimated  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified 
contractual allowances 
our hospitals recognize net patient revenue in the reporting period in which the services are performed based on our current billing rates  less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances 
an individual patient s bill is subject to adjustment on a patient by patient basis in the ordinary course of business by the payers following their review of each particular bill 
we estimate the discounts for contractual allowances using the balance sheet approach on an individual hospital basis 
patient accounts receivable detail is analyzed to determine expected reimbursement for each patient 
expected reimbursement is summarized by payer classification and reconciled to the balance sheet 
a secondary review is completed at the consolidated hospitals level to validate calculations 
estimates are regularly reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration medicare reimbursement rules and known changes to contract terms  laws and regulations and payment history 
if such information indicates that our allowances are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional allowances as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
laws and regulations governing medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount 
the estimated reimbursement amounts are adjusted in subsequent periods as cost reports are prepared and filed and as final settlements are determined 
in  our hospitals recorded favorable net settlements of prior year medicare and medicaid cost reports aggregating million 
we did not record any significant adjustments for prior year cost reports in or we are not aware of any material claims  disputes  or unsettled matters with third party payers 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets  both tangible and intangible  based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss should be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of an intangible asset to its revised estimate of fair value based on the impact of a change in ltach regulations issued by cms on may  see note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this impairment loss 
as required by statement no 
 we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill  by comparing the reporting unit s fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
our primary reporting units are our contract therapy  hospital rehabilitation services and hospital businesses 
we calculated the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
these assumptions are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations  and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies 
we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge 
we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  a divestiture of a significant component of our business  significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events 
in addition  as our business or the way we manage our business changes  our reporting units may also change 
these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could materially impact our reported earnings in the periods such charges occur 
at december   unamortized goodwill related to our contract therapy  hospital rehabilitation services  hospitals and other healthcare services businesses was million  million  million and million  respectively 
we have not recorded any goodwill impairments during the three years ended december  our most recent impairment test was as of december  for our hospitals reporting unit  a decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment  however  a decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit would have resulted in a potential goodwill impairment 
the amount of the impairment loss  if any  would be determined during the second step of the impairment test 
impairment of long lived assets 
under statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  a long lived asset is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in  we decided to abandon an internal software development project we began in we had intended for this software application to be the building block of an integrated platform to support our strategy of clinically integrated post acute continuums of care 
because of cost overruns  this project was put on hold in with the intention of restarting the project at a later date 
following the hiring of a new chief information officer in the fourth quarter of  we completed a review of our information technology applications and concluded that this project would not meet the needs of the business and any additional costs necessary to make the application functional would be in excess of the anticipated benefit to be derived 
as a result of the decision to abandon this project  we recognized an impairment loss of million in to write off the entire carrying value of the previously capitalized software development costs 
health  workers compensation  and professional liability insurance accruals 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the combined amount of these accruals was approximately million 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
in analyzing the accruals  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals

investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we account for our former minority equity investment in intelistaf holdings  inc intelistaf and our current minority equity investment in howard regional specialty care  llc hrsc using the provisions of apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the company sold its starmed staffing business to intelistaf on february  in exchange for a minority equity interest in intelistaf 
the company recorded its initial investment in intelistaf at its fair value of million  as determined with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
during  intelistaf incurred significant operating losses even though the healthcare staffing industry as a whole showed signs of recovery 
the company reviewed its investment in intelistaf for impairment in accordance with requirements of apb opinion no 
based on this review  the company concluded that an other than temporary decline in the value of the company s investment had occurred in this impairment combined with the company s share of intelistaf s operating losses reduced the carrying value of the company s investment in intelistaf to million at december  on march   we elected to abandon our interest in intelistaf 
this decision was made for a variety of business reasons including intelistaf s continuing poor operating performance  intelistaf s liquidity problems  the disproportionate share of rehabcare management time and effort that has been devoted to this non core business and an expected income tax benefit to be derived from the abandonment 
our investment in intelistaf had a carrying value of approximately million as of december  this remaining carrying value was written off during the first quarter of the carrying value of our investment in hrsc was million at december  according to apb opinion no 
 a series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in value of the investment has occurred which is other than temporary and which should be recognized even though the decrease in value is in excess of what would otherwise be recognized by application of the equity method 
we currently believe no significant factors exist that would indicate an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in hrsc has occurred
