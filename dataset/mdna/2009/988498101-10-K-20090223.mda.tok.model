highlights worldwide system sales growth of  excluding foreign currency translation worldwide same store sales growth of record international development of  new units worldwide operating profit growth of  including a  or million  positive impact as described in the significant gains and charges section of this md a operating profit growth of in the china division and in the yri division  partially offset by a decline in the us record shareholder payout of nearly billion through share buybacks and dividends  with share buybacks reducing average diluted share counts by significant known events  trends or uncertainties impacting or expected to impact comparisons of reported or future results the following factors impacted comparability of operating performance for the years ended december   december  and december  and could impact comparability with our results in us restaurant profit our us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points in and decreased percentage points in these decreases were the primary drivers in the us operating profit declines of and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
restaurant profit in dollar terms was negatively impacted by million of commodity inflation for the full year additionally  restaurant profit in was negatively impacted by million due to higher property and casualty self insurance expense  exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchised stores  as we lapped favorability in these decreases were partially offset by company same store sales growth of resulting from pricing actions we have taken 
in  restaurant profit was negatively impacted versus by company same store sales declines of primarily due to taco bell and million of commodity inflation 
this unfavorability was partially offset by million of lower self insured property and casualty insurance expense  exclusive of the estimated reduction due to refranchised stores  driven by improved loss trends 
we anticipate that the us restaurant margin as a percentage of sales will improve approximately for the full year as a result of pricing actions we have taken and the moderation of commodity inflation 
china restaurant profit china division restaurant margin as a percentage of sales was  and for  and  respectively 
the declines in and were driven by commodity inflation  primarily chicken  of approximately million and million  respectively  and higher labor costs 
the decreases were partially offset by the impact of same store sales growth on restaurant margin 
in the china division  we expect that commodity inflation will moderate as progresses and restaurant margin will be at least flat versus impact of foreign currency translation on operating profit changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted the translation of our foreign currency denominated operating profit in our international and china divisions by million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  and million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  in  we currently expect foreign currency translation to have a significant negative impact on our reported international division operating profit and no significant impact on our reported china division operating profit 
given the nature and volatility of the foreign currency markets the full year forecasted foreign currency impact is difficult to quantify 
however  for the first quarter of we currently expect a million negative impact on yri s operating profit and a similar impact for the second quarter of consolidation of a former unconsolidated affiliate in china in  we began consolidating an entity in which we have a majority ownership interest and that operates the kfcs in beijing  china 
our partners in this entity are essentially state owned enterprises 
we historically did not consolidate this entity  instead accounting for the unconsolidated affiliate using the equity method of accounting  due to the effective participation of our partners in the significant decisions of the entity that were made in the ordinary course of business as addressed in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 investor s accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority shareholder or shareholders have certain approval or veto rights 
concurrent with a decision that we made on january  regarding top management of the entity  we no longer believe that our partners effectively participate in the decisions that are made in the ordinary course of business 
accordingly  we began consolidating this entity 
like our other unconsolidated affiliates  the accounting for this entity prior to resulted in royalties being reflected as franchise and license fees and our share of the entity s net income being reflected in other income expense 
the impact on our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  as a result of our consolidation of this entity was as follows increase decrease company sales company restaurant expenses franchise and license fees general and administrative expenses other income expense operating profit the impact on other income expense includes both the current year minority interest in pre tax earnings of the unconsolidated affiliate as well as the reduction in other income expense that resulted from our share of after tax earnings no longer being reported in other income expense 
the increase in operating profit was offset by a corresponding increase in income tax provision such that there was no impact to net income 
significant gains and charges as part of our plan to transform our us business we took several measures in that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations 
these measures the us business transformation measures included expansion of our us refranchising  potentially reducing our company ownership in the us to below by year end  charges relating to g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources primarily severance and early retirement costs  and investments in our us brands made on behalf of our franchisees such as equipment purchases 
as discussed in note  we are not including the impacts of these us business transformation measures in our us segment for performance reporting purposes 
in the year ended december   we recorded a pre tax loss of million from refranchising in the us  pre tax expense related to us g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources of million  and pre tax expense related to investments in our us brands of million 
the refranchising losses are more fully discussed in note and the store portfolio strategy of the md a 
these losses were more than offset in the year ended december  by a pre tax gain of approximately million related to the sale of our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan see note for further discussion of this transaction 
this gain was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statement of income and was not allocated to any segment for performance reporting purposes 
in  we currently expect to refranchise restaurants in the us the impact of this refranchising on our results will be determined by the stores that we are able to sell and the specific prices we are able to obtain for those stores 
in the first quarter of  the expenses related to the us g a productivity initiatives and realignment of resources are expected to total approximately million and investments in our us brands are expected to total approximately million 
we currently anticipate ongoing g a savings of approximately million  primarily within the us segment  as a result of the us business transformation measures we took in and will take in mexico value added tax vat exemption on october   mexico enacted new legislation that eliminated a tax ruling that allowed us to claim an exemption related to vat payments 
beginning on january   we were required to remit vat on all company restaurant sales resulting in lower company sales and restaurant profit 
as a result of this new legislation  our international division s company sales and restaurant profit for the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by approximately million and million  respectively 
the international division s system sales growth and restaurant margin as a percentage of sales were negatively impacted by approximately and percentage points  respectively  for the year ended december  for the first quarter of  the negative lapping impact is expected to be million after which there will be no impact on subsequent quarters in tax legislation mainland china on march   the national people s congress in mainland china enacted new tax legislation that went into effect on january  upon enactment  which occurred in the china division s second fiscal quarter  the deferred tax balances of all chinese entities  including our unconsolidated affiliates  were adjusted 
these income tax rate changes positively impacted our net income by approximately million compared to what it would have otherwise been had no new tax legislation been enacted 
the impacts on our income tax provision and operating profit in the year ended december  were not significant 
pizza hut united kingdom acquisition on september   we completed the acquisition of the remaining fifty percent ownership interest of our pizza hut united kingdom uk unconsolidated affiliate from our partner  paying approximately million in cash  including transaction costs and net of million of cash assumed 
additionally  we assumed the full liability  as opposed to our fifty percent share  associated with the pizza hut uk s capital leases of million and short term borrowings of million 
this unconsolidated affiliate operated more than restaurants in the uk at the date of acquisition 
prior to the acquisition  we accounted for our fifty percent ownership interest using the equity method of accounting 
thus  we reported our fifty percent share of the net income of the unconsolidated affiliate after interest expense and income taxes as other income expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we also recorded a franchise fee for the royalty received from the stores owned by the unconsolidated affiliate 
since the date of the acquisition  we have reported company sales and the associated restaurant costs  g a expense  interest expense and income taxes associated with the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate in the appropriate line items of our consolidated statement of income 
we no longer record franchise fee income for the restaurants previously owned by the unconsolidated affiliate  nor do we report other income under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of this acquisition  company sales and restaurant profit increased million and million  respectively  franchise fees decreased million and g a expenses increased million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  store portfolio strategy from time to time we sell company restaurants to existing and new franchisees where geographic synergies can be obtained or where franchisees expertise can generally be leveraged to improve our overall operating performance  while retaining company ownership of strategic us and international markets 
in the us  we are targeting company ownership of restaurants potentially below by year end  down from its current level of 
consistent with this strategy  company restaurants in the us were sold to franchisees in we recorded net refranchising losses of million in the us for the year ended december   primarily due to our refranchising of  or our offers to sell  certain stores or groups of stores for a price less than their carrying values 
we currently anticipate refranchising units in the us in we expect us refranchising will generate the following financial impacts over the three year period pre tax sales proceeds of about billion  us restaurant margin improvement of about percentage points  neutral to slightly dilutive to us operating profit and net refranchising gains of about million 
while it remains our intent to significantly reduce our ownership levels of pizza huts in the uk through refranchising  minimal activity took place in the timing of future refranchising is currently difficult to predict given refranchising results to date and the current economic environment 
refranchisings reduce our reported revenues and restaurant profits and increase the importance of system sales growth as a key performance measure 
additionally  g a expenses will decline over time as a result of these refranchising activities 
the timing of such declines will vary and often lag the actual refranchising activities as the synergies are typically dependent upon the size and geography of the respective deals 
g a expenses included in the tables below reflect only direct g a that we no longer incurred as a result of stores that were operated by us for all or some of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 
the following table summarizes our worldwide refranchising activities number of units refranchised refranchising proceeds  pretax refranchising net gains  pretax the impact on operating profit arising from refranchising is the net of a the estimated reductions in restaurant profit  which reflects the decrease in company sales  and g a expenses and b the increase in franchise fees from the restaurants that have been refranchised 
the tables presented below reflect the impacts on total revenues and on operating profit from stores that were operated by us for all or some portion of the respective previous year and were no longer operated by us as of the last day of the respective current year 
in these tables  decreased company sales and decreased restaurant profit represents the amount of sales or restaurant profit earned by the refranchised restaurants during the period we owned them in the prior year but did not own them in the current year 
increased franchise and license fees represents the franchise and license fees from the refranchised restaurants that were recorded by the company in the current year during periods in which the restaurants were company stores in the prior year

licensed units are generally units that offer limited menus and operate in non traditional locations like malls  airports  gasoline service stations  convenience stores  stadiums and amusement parks where a full scale traditional outlet would not be practical or efficient 
as licensed units have lower average unit sales volumes than our traditional units and our current strategy does not place a significant emphasis on expanding our licensed units  we do not believe that providing further detail of licensed unit activity provides significant or meaningful information 
b in our fiscal quarter ended march   we sold our interest in our unconsolidated affiliate in japan 
while we will no longer have an ownership interest in the entity that operates both kfcs and pizza huts in japan  it will continue to be a franchisee as it was when it operated as an unconsolidated affiliate 
see note c on january   we began consolidating an entity in china in which we have a majority ownership interest 
this entity was previously accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate and we reclassified the units accordingly 
see note multibrand restaurants are included in the totals above 
multibrand conversions increase the sales and points of distribution for the second brand added to a restaurant but do not result in an additional unit count 
similarly  a new multibrand restaurant  while increasing sales and points of distribution for two brands  results in just one additional unit count

adjustments to reserves and prior years also includes changes in tax reserves  including interest thereon  established for potential exposure we may incur if a taxing authority takes a position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements that we believe may impact our exposure

in may  million of senior unsecured notes matured  and the repayment was funded with additional borrowings under our credit facility  which are included in long term debt 
during our shareholders equity decreased approximately billion resulting in the company ending the year with a shareholders deficit 
this decrease was primarily driven by our shareholder payouts of approximately billion through share buybacks and dividends  a decline in the unrecognized funded status of our us pension plans of approximately million and approximately million of foreign currency translation adjustments during the year due to the strengthening of the us dollar 
these declines were partially offset by the company s net income for the year ended december  a recorded shareholders deficit under generally accepted accounting principles does not by itself preclude us from paying dividends to our shareholders or repurchasing shares of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources operating in the qsr industry allows us to generate substantial cash flows from the operations of our company stores and from our substantial franchise operations which require a limited yum investment 
in each of the last seven fiscal years  net cash provided by operating activities has exceeded billion 
we expect these levels of net cash provided by operating activities to continue in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we estimate that refranchising proceeds  prior to income taxes  will total at least million in however  unforeseen downturns in our business could adversely impact our cash flows from operations from the levels historically realized or our refranchising proceeds from those amounts expected 
in the event our cash flows are negatively impacted by business downturns  we believe we have the ability to temporarily reduce our discretionary spending without significant impact to our long term business prospects 
our discretionary spending includes capital spending for new restaurants  acquisitions of restaurants from franchisees  repurchases of shares of our common stock and dividends paid to our shareholders 
additionally  as of december  we had approximately billion in unused capacity under revolving credit facilities that expire in given this available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  our debt maturity schedule and our ability to reduce discretionary spending  we do not believe we will need to access the credit markets during to help ensure that we do not need to access the credit markets while continuing to build our liquidity and maintaining our financial flexibility  we do not currently plan to repurchase shares in additionally  we are managing our cash and debt positions in order to maintain our current investment grade ratings from standard poor s rating services bbb and moody s investors service baa 
a downgrade of our credit rating would increase the company s current borrowing costs and could impact the company s ability to access the credit markets if necessary 
based on the amount and composition of our debt at december  our interest expense would increase approximately million on a full year basis should we receive a one level downgrade in our ratings 
discretionary spending during  we invested million in our businesses  including approximately million in the us  million for the international division and million for the china division 
for  we estimate capital spending will be approximately million 
we returned approximately billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends in this is the fourth straight year that we returned over billion to our shareholders 
under the authority of our board of directors  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for billion during as mentioned above  the company does not currently plan to repurchase shares during during the year ended december   we paid cash dividends of million 
additionally  on november  our board of directors approved cash dividends of 
per share of common stock to be distributed on february  to shareholders of record at the close of business on january  the company is targeting an ongoing annual dividend payout ratio of of net income 
borrowing capacity our primary bank credit agreement comprises a billion syndicated senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility which matures in november and includes participating banks with commitments ranging from million to million 
we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may borrow up to the maximum borrowing limit  less outstanding letters of credit or banker s acceptances  where applicable 
at december   our unused credit facility totaled million net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
there were borrowings of million outstanding under the credit facility at december  the interest rate for borrowings under the credit facility ranges from to over the london interbank offered rate libor or is determined by an alternate base rate  which is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the alternate base rate  as applicable  depends on our performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the credit facility is payable at least quarterly 
we also have a million  syndicated revolving credit facility the international credit facility  or icf which matures in november and includes banks with commitments ranging from million to million 
we believe the syndication reduces our dependency on any one bank 
there was available credit of million and no borrowings outstanding under the icf at the end of the interest rate for borrowings under the icf ranges from to over libor or is determined by a canadian alternate base rate  which is the greater of the citibank  na  canadian branch s publicly announced reference rate or the canadian dollar offered rate plus 
the exact spread over libor or the canadian alternate base rate  as applicable  depends upon yum s performance under specified financial criteria 
interest on any outstanding borrowings under the icf is payable at least quarterly 
on july  we entered into a variable rate senior unsecured term loan domestic term loan  in an aggregate principal amount of million that matures in three years 
at our discretion the variable rate resets at one  two  three or six month intervals 
we determine whether the variable rate at each reset date is based upon libor plus an applicable spread of up to  or an alternative base rate 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  plus an applicable spread of up to 
the proceeds from the domestic term loan were used for general corporate purposes 
the credit facility  domestic term loan  and the icf are unconditionally guaranteed by our principal domestic subsidiaries 
additionally  the icf is unconditionally guaranteed by yum 
these agreements contain financial covenants relating to maintenance of leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and also contain affirmative and negative covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness and liens  and certain other transactions specified in the agreement 
given the company s strong balance sheet and cash flows we were able to comply with all debt covenant requirements at december  with a considerable amount of cushion 
the majority of our remaining long term debt primarily comprises senior unsecured notes with varying maturity dates from through and interest rates ranging from to 
the senior unsecured notes represent senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness 
amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes were billion at december  in may  million of senior unsecured notes matured  and the repayment was funded with additional borrowings under our credit facility 
contractual obligations in addition to any discretionary spending we may choose to make  our significant contractual obligations and payments as of december  included total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations a capital leases b operating leases b purchase obligations c other d total contractual obligations a debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments 
rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on an estimate of future interest rates 
excludes a fair value adjustment of million included in debt related to interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of our debt 
see note b these obligations  which are shown on a nominal basis  relate to more than  restaurants 
see note c purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate primarily to information technology  marketing  commodity agreements  purchases of property  plant and equipment as well as consulting  maintenance and other agreements 
d other consists of pension plan funding obligations  the current portion of unrecognized tax benefits and projected payments for deferred compensation 
we have not included in the contractual obligations table approximately million for long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various tax positions we have taken 
these liabilities may increase or decrease over time as a result of tax examinations  and given the status of the examinations  we cannot reliably estimate the period of any cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
these liabilities also include amounts that are temporary in nature and for which we anticipate that over time there will be no net cash outflow 
we have included in the contractual obligations table million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits that we expect to settle in cash in the next year 
we have included million in contributions we expect to make to our pension plans in in the contractual obligations table 
our most significant plan  the yum retirement plan the us plan  is a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering certain full time us salaried employees 
our funding policy with respect to the us plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements  including requirements of the pension protection act of  plus such additional amounts from time to time as determined to be appropriate to improve the us plan s funded status 
we currently estimate that we will contribute approximately million to the us plan in contributions beyond will depend upon the timing and amount of our asset returns as well as changes in applicable discount rates 
at our measurement date  our pension plans in the us  which include the us plan and an unfunded supplemental executive plan  had a projected benefit obligation of million and plan assets of million 
the funding rules for our pension plans outside of the us vary from country to country and depend on many factors including discount rates  performance of plan assets  local laws and regulations 
our most significant plans are in the uk the projected benefit obligation of our pension plans in the uk exceeded plan assets by million at our measurement date 
we have committed to make a discretionary funding contribution of approximately million in to one of these plans 
the plans are currently under review to determine if additional discretionary pension funding payments will be committed to in our postretirement plan in the us is not required to be funded in advance  but is pay as you go 
we made postretirement benefit payments of million in and no future funding amounts are included in the contractual obligations table 
see note for further details about our pension and postretirement plans 
we have excluded from the contractual obligations table payments we may make for exposures for which we are self insured  including workers compensation  employment practices liability  general liability  automobile liability  product liability and property losses collectively property and casualty losses and employee healthcare and long term disability claims 
the majority of our recorded liability for self insured employee healthcare  long term disability and property and casualty losses represents estimated reserves for incurred claims that have yet to be filed or settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we have provided a partial guarantee of approximately million of a franchisee loan program used primarily to assist franchisees in the development of new restaurants and  to a lesser extent  in connection with the company s historical refranchising programs at december  we have also provided two letters of credit totaling approximately million in support of the franchisee loan program 
one such letter of credit could be used if we fail to meet our obligations under our guarantee 
the other letter of credit could be used  in certain circumstances  to fund our participation in the funding of the franchisee loan program 
the total loans outstanding under the loan pool were approximately million at december  our unconsolidated affiliates had approximately million and million of debt outstanding as of december  and december   respectively 
new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report for further details of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
critical accounting policies and estimates our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations or financial condition 
changes in the estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies follows 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we evaluate our restaurant assets and certain definite lived intangible assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level except when there is an expectation that we will refranchise restaurants as a group 
impairment evaluations for individual restaurants that we are currently operating and have not offered for sale are performed on a semi annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable including a decision to close a restaurant 
our semi annual impairment test includes those restaurants that have experienced two consecutive years of operating losses 
our semi annual impairment evaluations require an estimation of forecasted cash flows of the restaurant and any terminal value 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as sales growth and margin improvement to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the unit and actual results at comparable restaurants 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant subject to our semi annual test are not recoverable based upon forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
this fair value is determined by discounting the forecasted after tax cash flows  including terminal value  of the restaurant 
the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a restaurant or groups of restaurants and its related long lived assets 
the discount rate incorporates observed rates of returns for historical refranchising market transactions and we believe it is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
we often refranchise restaurants in groups and  therefore  perform such impairment evaluations at the group level 
these impairment evaluations are generally performed at the date such restaurants are offered for sale 
forecasted cash flows in such instances consist of estimated holding period cash flows and the expected sales proceeds 
expected sales proceeds are based on the most relevant of historical sales multiples or bids from buyers  and have historically been reasonably accurate estimations of the proceeds ultimately received 
we have certain definite lived intangible assets that are not attributable to a specific restaurant  such as the ljs and a w trademark brand intangible assets and franchise contract rights  which are amortized over their expected useful lives 
we base the expected useful lives of our trademark brand intangible assets on a number of factors including the competitive environment  our future development plans for the applicable concept and the level of franchisee commitment to the concept 
we generally base the expected useful lives of our franchise contract rights on their respective contractual terms including renewals when appropriate 
these definite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable 
an intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value  which is based on discounted cash flows 
for purposes of our impairment analysis  we update the cash flows that were initially used to value the definite lived intangible asset to reflect our current estimates and assumptions over the asset s future remaining life 
see note for a further discussion of our policy regarding the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment of goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates impairment might exist 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment through the comparison of fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
our reporting units are our operating segments in the us and our business management units internationally typically individual countries 
fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit  and is generally estimated using either discounted expected future cash flows from operations or the present value of the estimated future franchise royalty stream plus any estimated sales proceeds from refranchising 
future cash flow estimates and the discount rate are the key assumptions when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
future cash flows are based on our growth expectations relative to recent historical performance 
these growth expectations are based on assumptions for key performance indicators such as company sales  franchise and license fees and restaurant profit and are consistent with our internal operating plans 
the discount rate is our estimate of the required rate of return that a third party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit 
we believe the discount rate is commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows 
we have two international reporting units that have experienced deteriorating operating performance over the past few years 
these reporting units have goodwill of million and million as of the end of the assumptions used in determining fair value for these reporting units reflect our belief that the businesses are experiencing temporary declines and that they will turn around 
while these growth assumptions are consistent with our internal operating plans and reflect what we believe are reasonable and achievable growth rates  failure to realize these growth rates could result in future impairment of some or all of the recorded goodwill 
likewise  if we believe the risks inherent in the businesses increase  the resulting change in the discount rate could result in future impairment of some or all of the recorded goodwill 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding goodwill 
allowances for franchise and license receivables lease guarantees we reserve a franchisee s or licensee s entire receivable balance based upon pre defined aging criteria and upon the occurrence of other events that indicate that we may not collect the balance due 
as a result of reserving using this methodology  we have an immaterial amount of receivables that are past due that have not been reserved for at december  we have also issued certain guarantees as a result of assigning our interest in obligations under operating leases  primarily as a condition to the refranchising of certain company restaurants 
such guarantees are subject to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
we recognize a liability for the fair value of such lease guarantees under sfas upon refranchising and upon any subsequent renewals of such leases when we remain contingently liable 
the fair value of a guarantee is the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties 
if payment on the guarantee becomes probable and estimable  we record a liability for our exposure under these lease assignments and guarantees 
at december   we have recorded an immaterial liability for our exposure which we consider to be probable and estimable 
the potential total exposure under such leases is significant  with approximately million representing the present value  discounted at our pre tax cost of debt  of the minimum payments of the assigned leases at december  current franchisees are the primary lessees under the vast majority of these leases 
we generally have cross default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of non payment under the lease 
we believe these cross default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases and  historically  we have not been required to make such payments in significant amounts 
see note for a further discussion of our policies regarding franchise and license operations 
see note for a further discussion of our lease guarantees 
self insured property and casualty losses we record our best estimate of the remaining cost to settle incurred self insured property and casualty losses 
the estimate is based on the results of an independent actuarial study and considers historical claim frequency and severity as well as changes in factors such as our business environment  benefit levels  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact overall self insurance costs 
additionally  a risk margin to cover unforeseen events that may occur over the several years it takes for claims to settle is included in our reserve  increasing our confidence level that the recorded reserve is adequate 
see note for a further discussion of our insurance programs 
pension plans certain of our employees are covered under defined benefit pension plans 
the most significant of these plans are in the us we have recorded the under funded status of million for these us plans as a pension liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  these us plans had a projected benefit obligation pbo of million and a fair value of plan assets of million at december  the pbo reflects the actuarial present value of all benefits earned to date by employees and incorporates assumptions as to future compensation levels 
due to the relatively long time frame over which benefits earned to date are expected to be paid  our pbo s are highly sensitive to changes in discount rates 
for our us plans  we measured our pbo using a discount rate of at december  this discount rate was determined with the assistance of our independent actuary 
the primary basis for our discount rate determination is a model that consists of a hypothetical portfolio of ten or more corporate debt instruments rated aa or higher by moody s with cash flows that mirror our expected benefit payment cash flows under the plans 
we excluded from the model those corporate debt instruments flagged by moody s for a potential downgrade and bonds with yields that were two standard deviations or more above the mean 
in considering possible bond portfolios  the model allows the bond cash flows for a particular year to exceed the expected benefit cash flows for that year 
such excesses are assumed to be reinvested at appropriate one year forward rates and used to meet the benefit cash flows in a future year 
the weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio was used to arrive at an appropriate discount rate 
we also insure that changes in the discount rate as compared to the prior year are consistent with the overall change in prevailing market rates and make adjustments as necessary 
a basis point increase in this discount rate would have decreased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement date 
conversely  a basis point decrease in this discount rate would have increased our us plans pbo by approximately million at our measurement dates 
the pension expense we will record in is also impacted by the discount rate we selected at our measurement date 
we expect pension expense for our us plans to increase approximately million to million in the increase is primarily driven by an increase in amortization of net loss 
a basis point change in our discount rate assumption at our measurement date would impact our us pension expense by approximately million 
the assumption we make regarding our expected long term rates of return on plan assets also impacts our pension expense 
our estimated long term rate of return on us plan assets represents the weighted average of historical returns for each asset category  adjusted for an assessment of current market conditions 
our expected long term rate of return on us plan assets at december  was 
we believe this rate is appropriate given the composition of our plan assets and historical market returns thereon 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in our expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption would decrease or increase  respectively  our us pension plan expense by approximately million 
the losses our us plan assets have experienced  along with a decrease in discount rates over time  have largely contributed to an unrecognized pre tax net loss of million included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the us plans at december  for purposes of determining expense  our funded status was such that we recognized million of net loss in net periodic benefit cost 
we will recognize approximately million of such loss in see note for further discussion of our pension and post retirement plans 
stock options and stock appreciation rights expense compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights sars is estimated on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
our specific weighted average assumptions for the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield are documented in note additionally  under sfas no 
revised  share based compensation sfas r we are required to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for purposes of determining compensation expense to be recognized 
future expense amounts for any particular quarterly or annual period could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
we have determined that it is appropriate to group our awards into two homogeneous groups when estimating expected term and pre vesting forfeitures 
these groups consist of grants made primarily to restaurant level employees under our restaurant general manager stock option plan the rgm plan and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans 
historically  approximately of total options and sars granted have been made under the rgm plan 
grants under the rgm plan typically cliff vest after four years and grants made to executives under our other stock award plans typically have a graded vesting schedule and vest per year over four years 
we use a single weighted average expected term for our awards that have a graded vesting schedule as permitted by sfas r 
we revaluate our expected term assumptions using historical exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior on a regular basis 
based on the results of this analysis  we have determined that six years is an appropriate expected term for awards to both restaurant level employees and to executives 
upon each stock award grant we revaluate the expected volatility  including consideration of both historical volatility of our stock as well as implied volatility associated with our traded options 
we have estimated forfeitures based on historical data 
based on such data  we believe that approximately of all awards granted under the rgm plan will be forfeited and approximately of all awards granted to above store executives will be forfeited 
income taxes at december   we had a valuation allowance of million primarily to reduce our net operating loss and tax credit carryforward benefits of million  as well as our other deferred tax assets  to amounts that will more likely than not be realized 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards exist in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions that have varying carryforward periods and restrictions on usage  including approximately million in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be carried forward indefinitely 
the estimation of future taxable income in these jurisdictions and our resulting ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards can significantly change based on future events  including our determinations as to the feasibility of certain tax planning strategies 
thus  recorded valuation allowances may be subject to material future changes 
as a matter of course  we are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
effective december   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes fin 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
at december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits  million of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
since adopting fin  we have evaluated unrecognized tax benefits  including interest thereon  on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  which may impact our ultimate payment for such exposures 
additionally  we have not recorded the deferred tax impact for certain undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries totaling approximately billion at december   as we believe these amounts are indefinitely reinvested 
if our intentions were to change in the future based on a change in circumstances  deferred tax may need to be provided that could materially impact income taxes 
see note for a further discussion of our income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks associated with interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
in the normal course of business and in accordance with our policies  we manage these risks through a variety of strategies  which may include the use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to hedge our underlying exposures 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
interest rate risk we have a market risk exposure to changes in interest rates  principally in the us we attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of the underlying debt 
accordingly  any change in market value associated with interest rate swaps is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
at december  and december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result  over the following twelve month period  in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in income before income taxes 
the estimated reductions are based upon the current level of variable rate debt and assume no changes in the volume or composition of that debt and include no impact from interest income related to cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative financial instruments at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of our senior unsecured notes at december  and december  would decrease approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved and using discount rates appropriate for the duration 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the combined international division and china division operating profits constitute approximately of our operating profit in  excluding unallocated income expenses 
in addition  the company s net asset exposure defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities totaled approximately billion as of december  operating in international markets exposes the company to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s primary exposures result from our operations in asia pacific  europe and the americas 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates would impact the translation of our investments in foreign operations  the fair value of our foreign currency denominated financial instruments and our reported foreign currency denominated earnings and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended december   operating profit would have decreased million if all foreign currencies had uniformly weakened relative to the us dollar 
the estimated reduction assumes no changes in sales volumes or local currency sales or input prices 
we attempt to minimize the exposure related to our investments in foreign operations by financing those investments with local currency debt when practical 
in addition  we attempt to minimize the exposure related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments by purchasing goods and services from third parties in local currencies when practical 
consequently  foreign currency denominated financial instruments consist primarily of intercompany short term receivables and payables 
at times  we utilize forward contracts to reduce our exposure related to these intercompany short term receivables and payables 
the notional amount and maturity dates of these contracts match those of the underlying receivables or payables such that our foreign currency exchange risk related to these instruments is minimized 
commodity price risk we are subject to volatility in food costs as a result of market risk associated with commodity prices 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we manage our exposure to this risk primarily through pricing agreements with our vendors
