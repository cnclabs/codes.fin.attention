item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statements  our consolidated financial statements and notes that follow and the consolidated five year summary of selected financial data and the risk factors included in our annual report on form k 
certain key terms and abbreviations are defined in the glossary of selected terminology 
overview we are engaged in providing financial planning  products and services that are designed to be utilized as solutions for our clients cash and liquidity  asset accumulation  income  protection and estate and wealth transfer needs 
as of december   we had a network of more than  financial advisors and registered representatives affiliated financial advisors 
in addition to serving clients through our affiliated financial advisors  our asset management  annuity  and auto and home protection products are distributed through third party advisors and affinity relationships 
we deliver solutions to our clients through an approach focused on building long term personal relationships between our advisors and clients 
we offer financial planning and advice that are responsive to our clients evolving needs and helps them achieve their identified financial goals by recommending actions and a range of product solutions consisting of investment  annuities  insurance  banking and other financial products that help them attain over time a return or form of protection while accepting what they determine to be an appropriate range and level of risk 
the financial product solutions we offer through our affiliated advisors include both our own products and services and products of other companies 
our financial planning and advisory process is designed to provide comprehensive advice  when appropriate  to address our clients cash and liquidity  asset accumulation  income  protection  and estate and wealth transfer needs 
we believe that our focus on personal relationships  together with our strengths in financial planning and product development  allows us to better address our clients financial needs  including the financial needs of our primary target market segment  the mass affluent and affluent  which we define as households with investable assets of more than  this focus also puts us in a strong position to capitalize on significant demographic and market trends  which we believe will continue to drive increased demand for our financial planning and other financial services 
deep client advisor relationships are central to the ability of our business model to succeed through market cycles  including the extreme market conditions that persisted through we have four main operating segments advice wealth management  asset management  annuities and protection  as well as our corporate other segment 
our four main operating segments are aligned with the financial solutions we offer to address our clients needs 
the products and services we provide retail clients and  to a lesser extent  institutional clients  are the primary source of our revenues and net income 
revenues and net income are significantly impacted by investment performance and the total value and composition of assets we manage and administer for our retail and institutional clients as well as the distribution fees we receive from other companies 
these factors  in turn  are largely determined by overall investment market performance and the depth and breadth of our individual client relationships 
equity market  credit market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations  primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset based fees we earn  the spread income generated on our annuities  banking and deposit products and universal life ul insurance products  the value of deferred acquisition costs dac and deferred sales inducement costs dsic assets associated with variable annuity and variable ul products  the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits 
for additional information regarding our sensitivity to equity risk and interest rate risk  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
it is management s priority to increase shareholder value over a multi year horizon by achieving our on average  over time financial targets 
our financial targets are net revenue growth of to  earnings per diluted share growth of to  and return on equity of to 
our net revenues for the year ended december  were billion  a decrease of billion  or  from the prior year period 
this revenue decline primarily reflects the unprecedented impacts of the credit market events that occurred during the last few weeks of september and the fourth quarter of the majority of the impacts from the credit market events have been reflected in net investment income  which decreased billion  or  from the prior year period 
the credit market events and weak equity markets also negatively impacted management and financial advice fees and distribution fees 

table of contents our consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was million  a decline of million from our consolidated net income of million for the year ended december  loss per share for the year ended december  was  compared to earnings per diluted share of for the prior year period 
we continue to establish ameriprise financial as a financial services leader as we focus on meeting the financial needs of the mass affluent and affluent  as evidenced by our continued leadership in financial planning and our strong corporate foundation 
our franchisee advisor and client retention remain strong at and  respectively  as of december  branded financial plan net cash sales for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ago period 
our owned  managed and administered oma assets declined to billion at december   a net decrease of from december   reflecting the decline in the s p index from the prior year period  partially offset by the addition of billion in assets from the completion of our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we completed the all cash acquisitions of h r block financial advisors  inc  subsequently renamed ameriprise advisor services  inc aasi  j 
w 
seligman co  incorporated seligman and brecek young advisors  inc to expand our retail distribution and asset management businesses 
the cost of the acquisitions was million  which included the purchase price and transaction costs 
we recorded the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value and allocated the remaining costs to goodwill and intangible assets 
integration charges of million were included in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  goodwill impairment testing in addition to our annual impairment evaluation for goodwill as of july  we evaluated goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of due to the unprecedented credit and equity market events 
we concluded our goodwill was not impaired 
share repurchase program during the years ended december  and  we purchased million shares and million shares  respectively  for an aggregate cost of million and million  respectively 
in april  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to billion for the repurchase of our common stock through april as of december   we had billion remaining under this share repurchase authorization 
in light of the current market environment  we have temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program 
we may resume activity under our stock repurchase program and begin repurchasing shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time without notice 
we reserve the right to suspend any such repurchases and to resume later repurchasing at any time  and expressly disclaim any obligation to maintain or lift any such suspension 
separation from american express on february   the american express board of directors announced its intention to pursue the disposition of of its shareholdings in our company the separation through a tax free distribution to american express shareholders 
effective as of the close of business on september   american express completed the separation of our company and the distribution of our common shares to american express shareholders the distribution 
prior to the distribution  we had been a wholly owned subsidiary of american express 
our separation from american express resulted in specifically identifiable impacts to our and consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we incurred a total of million of non recurring separation costs as part of our separation from american express 
these costs were primarily associated with establishing the ameriprise financial brand  separating and reestablishing our technology platforms and advisor and employee retention programs 
our separation from american express was completed in critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies that we use affect our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting and reporting policies are critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition and  in some cases  the application of these policies can be significantly affected by the estimates  judgments and assumptions made by management during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting and reporting policies we have identified as fundamental to a full understanding of our results of operations and financial condition are described below 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our accounting policies 
valuation of investments the most significant component of our investments is our available for sale securities  which we generally carry at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  was primarily obtained from third party pricing sources 
we record unrealized securities gains losses in accumulated other 
table of contents comprehensive income loss  net of income tax provision benefit and net of adjustments in other asset and liability balances  such as dac  to reflect the expected impact on their carrying values had the unrealized securities gains losses been realized as of the respective balance sheet dates 
at december   we had net unrealized pretax losses on available for sale securities of billion 
we recognize gains and losses in results of operations upon disposition of the securities 
we also recognize losses in results of operations when management determines that a decline in value is other than temporary 
a write down for impairment can be recognized for both credit related events and for change in fair value due to changes in interest rates 
once a security is written down to fair value through net income  any subsequent recovery in value cannot be recognized in net income until the principal is returned 
the determination of other than temporary impairment requires the exercise of judgment regarding the amount and timing of recovery 
factors we consider in determining whether declines in the fair value of fixed maturity securities are other than temporary include the extent to which the market value is below amortized cost  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time for it to recover to an amount at least equal to its carrying value  the duration of time in which there has been a significant decline in value  fundamental analysis of the liquidity  business prospects and overall financial condition of the issuer  and market events that could impact credit ratings  economic and business climate  litigation and government actions  and similar external business factors 
for structured investments eg  mortgage backed securities  the company also considers factors such as overall deal structure and our position within the structure  quality of underlying collateral  delinquencies and defaults  loss severities  recoveries  prepayments  cumulative loss projections and discounted cash flows in assessing potential other than temporary impairment of these investments 
based upon these factors  securities that have indicators of potential other than temporary impairment are subject to detailed review by management 
in response to the market dislocation in the fourth quarter of and expectations of continued dislocation in  management increased the discount rate  expected loss and severity rates used to value non agency residential mortgage backed securities and increased the expected default rates for high yield corporate credits 
securities for which declines are considered temporary continue to be carefully monitored by management 
as of december   we had billion in gross unrealized losses that related to billion of available for sale securities  of which billion have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for months or more 
these investment securities had an overall ratio of of fair value to amortized cost at december  as part of our ongoing monitoring process  management determined that a majority of the gross unrealized losses on these securities were attributable to changes in interest rates and credit spreads across asset classes 
additionally  because we have the ability as well as the intent to hold these securities for a time sufficient to recover our amortized cost  we concluded that none of these securities were other than temporarily impaired at december  deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement costs for our annuity and life  disability income and long term care insurance products  our dac and dsic balances at any reporting date are supported by projections that show management expects there to be adequate premiums or estimated gross profits after that date to amortize the remaining dac and dsic balances 
these projections are inherently uncertain because they require management to make assumptions about financial markets  anticipated mortality and morbidity levels and policyholder behavior over periods extending well into the future 
projection periods used for our annuity products are typically to years  while projection periods for our life  disability income and long term care insurance products are often years or longer 
management regularly monitors financial market conditions and actual policyholder behavior experience and compares them to its assumptions 
for annuity and universal life insurance products  the assumptions made in projecting future results and calculating the dac balance and dac amortization expense are management s best estimates 
management is required to update these assumptions whenever it appears that  based on actual experience or other evidence  earlier estimates should be revised 
when assumptions are changed  the percentage of estimated gross profits used to amortize dac might also change 
a change in the required amortization percentage is applied retrospectively  an increase in amortization percentage will result in a decrease in the dac balance and an increase in dac amortization expense  while a decrease in amortization percentage will result in an increase in the dac balance and a decrease in dac amortization expense 
the impact on results of operations of changing assumptions can be either positive or negative in any particular period and is reflected in the period in which such changes are made 
for products with associated dsic  the same policy applies in calculating the dsic balance and periodic dsic amortization 
for other life  disability income and long term care insurance products  the assumptions made in calculating our dac balance and dac amortization expense are consistent with those used in determining the liabilities and  therefore  are intended to provide for adverse deviations in experience and are revised only if management concludes experience will be so adverse that dac are not recoverable 
if management concludes that dac are not recoverable  dac are reduced to the amount that is recoverable based on best estimate assumptions and there is a corresponding expense recorded in our consolidated results of operations 
for annuity and life  disability income and long term care insurance products  key assumptions underlying these long term projections include interest rates both earning rates on invested assets and rates credited to contractholder and policyholder 
table of contents accounts  equity market performance  mortality and morbidity rates and the rates at which policyholders are expected to surrender their contracts  make withdrawals from their contracts and make additional deposits to their contracts 
assumptions about earned and credited interest rates are the primary factors used to project interest margins  while assumptions about equity and bond market performance are the primary factors used to project client asset value growth rates  and assumptions about surrenders  withdrawals and deposits comprise projected persistency rates 
management must also make assumptions to project maintenance expenses associated with servicing our annuity and insurance businesses during the dac amortization period 
the client asset value growth rates are the rates at which variable annuity and variable universal life insurance contract values invested in separate accounts are assumed to appreciate in the future 
the rates used vary by equity and fixed income investments 
management reviews and  where appropriate  adjusts its assumptions with respect to client asset value growth rates on a regular basis 
we typically use a mean reversion process as a guideline in setting near term equity asset growth rates based on a long term view of financial market performance as well as recent actual performance 
the suggested near term growth rate is reviewed to ensure consistency with management s assessment of anticipated equity market performance 
in the fourth quarter of  we decided to constrain near term equity growth rates below the level suggested by mean reversion 
this constraint is based on our analysis of historical equity returns following downturns in the market 
our long term client asset value growth rates are based on assumed gross annual returns of for equities and for fixed income securities 
if we increased or decreased our assumptions related to these growth rates by basis points  the impact on the dac and dsic balances would be an increase or decrease of approximately million 
we monitor other principal dac and dsic amortization assumptions  such as persistency  mortality  morbidity  interest margin and maintenance expense levels each quarter and  when assessed independently  each could impact our dac and dsic balances 
the analysis of dac and dsic balances and the corresponding amortization is a dynamic process that considers all relevant factors and assumptions described previously 
unless management identifies a significant deviation over the course of the quarterly monitoring  management reviews and updates these dac and dsic amortization assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
an assessment of sensitivity associated with changes in any single assumption would not necessarily be an indicator of future results 
we adopted american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting by insurance enterprises for deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or exchanges of insurance contracts sop on january  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the effect of our adoption of sop and our accounting policies for the amortization and capitalization of dac 
in periods prior to  our policy had been to treat certain internal replacement transactions as continuations and to continue amortization of dac associated with the existing contract against revenues from the new contract 
for details regarding the balances of and changes in dac for the years ended december   and see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liabilities for future policy benefits and policy claims and other policyholders funds fixed annuities and variable annuity guarantees future policy benefits and policy claims and other policyholders funds related to fixed annuities and variable annuity guarantees include liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable deferred annuities  guaranteed benefits associated with variable annuities  equity indexed annuities and fixed annuities in a payout status 
liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable deferred annuities are equal to accumulation values  which are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less withdrawals and various charges 
the majority of the variable annuity contracts offered by us contain guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb provisions 
when market values of the customer s accounts decline  the death benefit payable on a contract with a gmdb may exceed the contract accumulation value 
the company also offers variable annuities with death benefit provisions that gross up the amount payable by a certain percentage of contract earnings which are referred to as gain gross up benefits 
in addition  the company offers contracts with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab provisions and  until may  the company offered contracts containing guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib provisions 
as a result of the recent market decline  the amount by which guarantees exceed the accumulation value has increased significantly 
in determining the liabilities for variable annuity death benefits  gmib and the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb  we project these benefits and contract assessments using actuarial models to simulate various equity market scenarios 
significant assumptions made in projecting future benefits and assessments relate to customer asset value growth rates  mortality  persistency and investment margins and are consistent with those used for dac asset valuation for the same contracts 
as with dac  management will review  and where appropriate  adjust its assumptions each quarter 
unless 
table of contents management identifies a material deviation over the course of quarterly monitoring  management will review and update these assumptions annually in the third quarter of each year 
in response to the market dislocation in the fourth quarter of and expectations of continued dislocation in  management lowered future variable annuity and variable universal life profit expectations based on continued depreciation in contract values and historical equity market return patterns 
the variable annuity death benefit liability is determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value and recognizing the excess over the estimated meaningful life based on expected assessments eg  mortality and expense fees  contractual administrative charges and similar fees 
if elected by the contract owner and after a stipulated waiting period from contract issuance  a gmib guarantees a minimum lifetime annuity based on a specified rate of contract accumulation value growth and predetermined annuity purchase rates 
the gmib liability is determined each period by estimating the expected value of annuitization benefits in excess of the projected contract accumulation value at the date of annuitization and recognizing the excess over the estimated meaningful life based on expected assessments 
the embedded derivatives related to gmab and the non life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions are recorded at fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the fair value measurement of embedded derivatives 
the liability for the life contingent benefits associated with gmwb provisions is determined in the same way as the liability for variable annuity death benefits 
the changes in both the fair values of the gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the liability for life contingent benefits are reflected in benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses 
liabilities for equity indexed annuities are equal to the accumulation of host contract values covering guaranteed benefits and the market value of embedded equity options 
liabilities for fixed annuities in a benefit or payout status are based on future estimated payments using established industry mortality tables and interest rates  ranging from to at december   depending on year of issue  with an average rate of approximately life  disability income and long term care insurance future policy benefits and policy claims and other policyholders funds related to life  disability income and long term care insurance include liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable universal life policies  liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported claims  estimates of benefits payable on claims incurred but not yet reported and estimates of benefits that will become payable on term life  whole life  disability income and long term care policies as claims are incurred in the future 
liabilities for fixed account values on fixed and variable universal life insurance are equal to accumulation values 
accumulation values are the cumulative gross deposits and credited interest less various contractual expense and mortality charges and less amounts withdrawn by policyholders 
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported life insurance claims are equal to the death benefits payable under the policies 
liabilities for unpaid amounts on reported disability income and long term care claims include any periodic or other benefit amounts due and accrued  along with estimates of the present value of obligations for continuing benefit payments 
these amounts are calculated based on claim continuance tables which estimate the likelihood an individual will continue to be eligible for benefits 
present values are calculated at interest rates established when claims are incurred 
anticipated claim continuance rates are based on established industry tables  adjusted as appropriate for the company s experience 
interest rates used with disability income claims ranged from to at december   with an average rate of 
interest rates used with long term care claims ranged from to at december   with an average rate of 
liabilities for estimated benefits payable on claims that have been incurred but not yet reported are based on periodic analysis of the actual time lag between when a claim occurs and when it is reported 
liabilities for estimates of benefits that will become payable on future claims on term life  whole life  disability income and long term care policies are based on the net level premium method  using anticipated premium payments  mortality and morbidity rates  policy persistency and interest rates earned on assets supporting the liability 
anticipated mortality and morbidity rates are based on established industry mortality and morbidity tables  with modifications based on the company s experience 
anticipated premium payments and persistency rates vary by policy form  issue age  policy duration and certain other pricing factors 
anticipated interest rates for term and whole life ranged from to at december   depending on policy form  issue year and policy duration 
anticipated interest rates for disability income vary by plan and were and at policy issue grading to over five years and over years  respectively 
anticipated discount rates for long term care vary by plan and were at december  and range from to over years 
where applicable  benefit amounts expected to be recoverable from reinsurance companies who share in the risk are separately recorded as reinsurance recoverable within receivables 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to various market risks 
all derivatives are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined using either market quotes or valuation models that are based upon the net present value of estimated future cash flows and incorporate current market observable inputs to the extent available 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on its intended use and the resulting hedge designation  if any 
we primarily use derivatives as economic hedges that are not designated as accounting hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we occasionally designate derivatives as hedges of changes in the fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments fair value hedges  hedges of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedges  or hedges of foreign currency exposures of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedges in foreign operations 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in current period earnings 
the changes in fair value of derivatives hedging variable annuity living benefits  equity indexed annuities and stock market certificates are included within benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses  interest credited to fixed accounts and banking and deposit interest expense  respectively 
the changes in fair value of all other derivatives are a component of net investment income 
our derivatives primarily provide economic hedges to equity market and interest rate exposures 
examples include structured derivatives  options  futures  equity and interest rate swaps and swaptions that economically hedge the equity and interest rate exposure of derivatives embedded in certain annuity and certificate liabilities  as well as exposure to price risk arising from proprietary mutual fund seed money investments 
for derivative instruments that qualify as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives  as well as of the corresponding hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments  are recognized in current earnings 
if a fair value hedge designation is removed or the hedge is terminated prior to maturity  previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item are recognized into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivative instruments are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings when the hedged item or transaction impacts earnings 
any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported currently in earnings 
if a hedge designation is removed or a hedge is terminated prior to maturity  the amount previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss may be recognized into earnings over the period that the hedged item impacts earnings 
for any hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur according to the original strategy  any related amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that qualify as net investment hedges in foreign operations  the effective portions of the change in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment 
any ineffective portions of net investment hedges in foreign operations are recognized in earnings during the period of change 
for further details on the types of derivatives we use and how we account for them  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
income tax accounting income taxes  as reported in our consolidated financial statements  represent the net amount of income taxes that we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations 
we provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe taking into account the recognition and measurement for uncertain tax positions 
inherent in the provision for income taxes are estimates and judgments regarding the tax treatment of certain items 
in the event that the ultimate tax treatment of items differs from our estimates  we may be required to significantly change the provision for income taxes recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the provision for income taxes  our consolidated financial statements reflect certain amounts related to deferred tax assets and liabilities  which result from temporary differences between the assets and liabilities measured for financial statement purposes versus the assets and liabilities measured for tax return purposes 
among our deferred tax assets is a significant deferred tax asset relating to capital losses that have been recognized for financial statement purposes but not yet for tax return purposes 
under current us federal income tax law  capital losses generally must be used against capital gain income within five years of the year in which the capital losses are recognized for tax purposes 
our life insurance subsidiaries will not be able to file a consolidated us federal income tax return with the other members of our affiliated group until  which will result in net operating and capital losses  credits and other tax attributes generated by one group not being available to offset income earned or taxes owed by the other group during the period of non consolidation 
this lack of consolidation could affect our ability to fully realize certain of our deferred tax assets  including the capital losses 

table of contents we are required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established  and the amount of such allowance if required 
factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains 
consideration is given to  among other things in making this determination  a future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  b future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  c taxable income in prior carryback years  and d tax planning strategies 
it is likely that management will need to identify and implement appropriate planning strategies to ensure our ability to realize our deferred tax asset and avoid the establishment of a valuation allowance with respect to such assets 
in the opinion of management  it is currently more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  including our capital loss deferred tax asset  therefore  no such valuation allowance has been established 
recent accounting pronouncements for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our future consolidated results of operations or financial condition  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenues and expenses management and financial advice fees management and financial advice fees relate primarily to fees earned from managing mutual funds  separate account and wrap account assets  institutional investments including structured investments  as well as fees earned from providing financial advice and administrative services including transfer agent  administration and custodial fees earned from providing services to retail mutual funds

the pia increases or decreases the level of management fees received based on the specific fund s relative performance as measured against a designated external index 
we recognize pia fee revenue on a month rolling performance basis 
employee benefit plan and institutional investment management and administration services fees are negotiated and are also generally based on underlying asset values 
we may receive performance based incentive fees from structured investments and hedge funds that we manage  which are recognized as revenue at the end of the performance period 
fees from financial planning and advice services are recognized when the financial plan is delivered 
distribution fees distribution fees primarily include point of sale fees such as mutual fund front end sales loads and asset based fees such as b distribution and shareholder service fees that are generally based on a contractual percentage of assets and recognized when earned 
distribution fees also include amounts received under marketing support arrangements for sales of mutual funds and other companies products  such as through our wrap accounts  as well as surrender charges on fixed and variable universal life insurance and annuities 
net investment income net investment income primarily includes interest income on fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale  commercial mortgage loans  policy loans  consumer loans  other investments and cash and cash equivalents  the changes in fair value of trading securities  including seed money  and certain derivatives  the pro rata share of net income or loss on equity method investments  and realized gains and losses on the sale of securities and charges for investments determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
interest income is accrued as earned using the effective interest method  which makes an adjustment of the yield for security premiums and discounts on all performing fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale  excluding structured securities  and commercial mortgage loans so that the related security or loan recognizes a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance throughout its term 
for beneficial interests in structured securities  the excess cash flows attributable to a beneficial interest over the initial investment are recognized as interest income over the life of the beneficial interest using the effective yield method 
realized gains and losses on securities  other than trading securities and equity method investments  are recognized using the specific identification method on a trade date basis 

table of contents premiums premiums include premiums on property casualty insurance  traditional life and health disability income and long term care insurance and immediate annuities with a life contingent feature 
premiums on auto and home insurance are net of reinsurance premiums and are recognized ratably over the coverage period 
premiums on traditional life and health insurance are net of reinsurance ceded and are recognized as revenue when due 
other revenues other revenues include certain charges assessed on fixed and variable universal life insurance and annuities  which consist of cost of insurance charges  net of reinsurance premiums for universal life insurance products  variable annuity guaranteed benefit rider charges and administration charges against contractholder accounts or balances 
premiums paid by fixed and variable universal life policyholders and annuity contractholders are considered deposits and are not included in revenue 
other revenues also include revenues related to certain limited partnerships that were consolidated beginning in banking and deposit interest expense banking and deposit interest expense primarily includes interest expense related to banking deposits and investment certificates 
additionally  banking and deposit interest expense includes interest on non recourse debt of a structured entity while it was consolidated  as well as interest expense related to debt of certain consolidated limited partnerships 
the changes in fair value of investment certificate embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging stock market certificates are included within banking and deposit interest expense 
distribution expenses distribution expenses primarily include compensation paid to the company s financial advisors  registered representatives  third party distributors and wholesalers  net of amounts capitalized and amortized as part of dac 
the amounts capitalized and amortized are based on actual distribution costs 
the majority of these costs  such as advisor and wholesaler compensation  vary directly with the level of sales 
distribution expenses also include marketing support and other distribution and administration related payments made to affiliated and unaffiliated distributors of products provided by the company s affiliates 
the majority of these expenses vary with the level of sales  or assets held  by these distributors or are fixed costs 
distribution expenses also include wholesaling costs 
interest credited to fixed accounts interest credited to fixed accounts represents amounts earned by contractholders and policyholders on fixed account values associated with fixed and variable universal life and annuity contracts 
the mark to market adjustment on equity indexed annuity embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging equity indexed annuities are included within interest credited to fixed accounts 
benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses consist of amounts paid and changes in liabilities held for anticipated future benefit payments under insurance policies and annuity contracts  along with costs to process and pay such amounts 
amounts are net of benefit payments recovered or expected to be recovered under reinsurance contracts 
benefits under variable annuity guarantees include the change in fair value of gmwb and gmab embedded derivatives and the derivatives hedging these benefits 
benefits  claims  losses and settlement expenses also include amortization of dsic 
amortization of dac direct sales commissions and other costs deferred as dac are amortized over time 
for annuity and universal life contracts  dac are amortized based on projections of estimated gross profits over amortization periods equal to the approximate life of the business 
for other insurance products  dac are generally amortized as a percentage of premiums over amortization periods equal to the premium paying period 
for certain mutual fund products  dac are generally amortized over fixed periods on a straight line basis adjusted for redemptions 
see deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement costs under critical accounting policies for further information on dac 
interest and debt expense interest and debt expense primarily includes interest on corporate debt  the impact of interest rate hedging activities and amortization of debt issuance costs

fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value  specifically  separate account assets  derivatives  embedded derivatives  properties held by our consolidated property funds  and most investments and cash equivalents 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions 
we include actual market prices  or observable inputs  in our fair value measurements to the extent available 
broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available 
we validate prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as price variance analysis  subsequent sales testing  stale price review  price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors 
sfas does not require the use of market prices that are the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale 
inactive markets through our own experience transacting in the marketplace and through discussions with our pricing vendors  we believe that the market for non agency residential mortgage backed securities is inactive 
indicators of inactive markets include pricing services reliance on brokers or discounted cash flow analyses to provide prices  an increase in the disparity between prices provided by different pricing services for the same security  unreasonably large bid offer spreads and a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
in certain cases  this market inactivity has resulted in our applying valuation techniques that rely more on an income approach discounted cash flows using market rates than on a market approach prices from pricing services 
we consider market observable yields for other asset classes we consider to be of similar risk which includes nonperformance and liquidity for individual securities to set the discount rate for applying the income approach to certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities 
the discount rates used for these securities at december  ranged from to 

table of contents at the beginning of the fourth quarter of  million of prime non agency residential mortgage backed securities were transferred from level to level of the fair value hierarchy because management believes the market for these prime quality assets is now inactive

residential mortgage backed securities backed by sub prime  alt a or prime collateral sub prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with weak credit profiles 
alt a mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have credit ratings above sub prime but may not conform to government sponsored standards 
prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential mortgage loans to customers with good credit profiles 
we have exposure to these types of loans predominantly through mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the slow down in the us housing market  combined with relaxed underwriting standards by some originators  has recently led to higher delinquency and loss rates for some of these investments 
recent market conditions have increased the likelihood of other than temporary impairments for certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities 
as a part of our risk management process  an internal rating system is used in conjunction with market data as the basis of analysis to assess the likelihood that we will not receive all contractual principal and interest payments for these investments 
for the investments that are more at risk for impairment  we perform our own assessment of projected cash flows incorporating assumptions about default rates  prepayment speeds  loss severity  and geographic concentrations to determine if an other than temporary impairment should be recognized 
based on this analysis  other than non agency mortgage backed securities that had credit related impairments recorded in  all contractual payments are expected to be received

since there is not a market for our obligations of our variable annuity riders  we consider the assumptions participants in a hypothetical market would make to reflect an exit price 
as a result  we adjust the valuation of variable annuity riders by updating certain contractholder assumptions  adding explicit margins to provide for profit  risk and expenses  and adjusting the rates used to discount expected cash flows to reflect a current market estimate of our nonperformance risk 
the nonperformance risk adjustment is based on broker quotes for credit default swaps that are adjusted to estimate the risk of our life insurance company subsidiaries not fulfilling these liabilities 
consistent with general market conditions  this estimate resulted in a spread over the libor swap curve as of december  as our estimate of this spread widens or tightens  the liability will decrease or increase 
if this nonperformance credit spread moves to a zero 
table of contents spread over the libor swap curve  the reduction to net income would be approximately million  net of dac and dsic amortization and income taxes  based on december  credit spreads 
the nonperformance risk for our derivatives is managed and mitigated primarily through the use of master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements 
as of december   any deterioration in our derivative counterparties credit would not materially impact our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources overview we maintained substantial liquidity during at december   we had billion in cash and cash equivalents compared to billion at december  approximately billion of the increase in cash and cash equivalents was from increases in collateral received from derivative counterparties as our living benefits hedge portfolio gained in value 
excluding the collateral balances  cash and cash equivalents were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
we have additional liquidity available through an unsecured revolving credit facility for million that expires in september under the terms of the underlying credit agreement  we can increase this facility to billion 
available borrowings under this facility are reduced by any outstanding letters of credit 
we have had no borrowings under this credit facility and had million of outstanding letters of credit at december  we believe cash flows from operating activities  available cash balances and our availability of revolver borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate  equity price  foreign currency and credit risk are the market risks to which we have material exposure 
equity market and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations  primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other asset based fees we earn  the spread income generated on our annuities  banking  and face amount certificate products and ul insurance products  the value of dac and dsic assets associated with variable annuity and variable ul products  the values of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the values of derivatives held to hedge these benefits 
changes in both the equity and fixed income markets during have affected our market risk position 
these changes resulted in lower asset values against which we take asset based management and distribution fees as well as increases in our stated liabilities for variable annuity guaranteed benefits 
the guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities are gmwb  gmab  gmdb and gmib options 
each of the guaranteed benefits mentioned above guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying investment assets 
to evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a month period following a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates and a hypothetical decline in equity markets 
due to the market conditions in the second half of  we also performed sensitivity testing using a hypothetical decline in equity markets 
equity price risk includes absolute market level and implied market volatility changes 
the estimates of net equity price risk exposure presented below assume no changes in implied market volatility 
the numbers below show our estimate of the pretax impact of these hypothetical market moves  net of hedging  as of december  dac and dsic changes are shown based on the impact of projecting lower profits as a result of the market declines as well as linked specifically to the changes in our variable annuity riders 
following the table is a discussion by source of risk and the portfolio management techniques and derivative instruments we use to mitigate these risks

market impact on dac and dsic amortization resulting from lower projected profits 
market impact on dac and dsic amortization related to variable annuity riders is modeled net of hedge impact 
the above results compare to estimated negative impacts of million related to a basis point increase in interest rates and million related to a equity market decline as of december  the larger impact in is a result of market dislocation in and changes to our valuation models 
the discount rates and credit spreads we use to value certain of our investments have been negatively impacted by the current market 
this has led to greater pretax loss projections related to our variable annuity riders  partially offset by a lower impact to our asset based management and distribution fees  primarily as a result of lower asset values 
in addition  management s action to constrain the near term growth rate for equities in the dac models results in a greater pretax loss under the above equity scenarios 
actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions 
these include assuming the composition of invested assets and liabilities does not change in the month period following the hypothetical market decline  that there are no changes in implied market volatility and the increase in interest rates produces a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the selection of a basis point interest rate increase as well as and equity market declines should not be construed as a prediction of future market events 
asset based management and distribution fees we earn asset based management fees on our owned separate account assets and certain of our managed assets 
at december   the value of these assets was billion and billion  respectively 
we also earn distribution fees 
table of contents on our managed assets 
these sources of revenue are subject to both interest rate and equity price risk since the value of these assets and the fees they earn fluctuate inversely with interest rates and directly with equity prices 
we do not hedge the interest rate or equity price risk of this exposure 
dac and dsic amortization for annuity and universal life products  dac and dsic are amortized on the basis of estimated gross profits 
estimated gross profits are a proxy for pretax income prior to the recognition of dac and dsic amortization expense 
when events occur that reduce or increase current period estimated gross profits  dac and dsic amortization expense is typically reduced or increased as well  somewhat mitigating the impact of the event on pretax income 
variable annuity riders the guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities are gmwb  gmab  gmdb and gmib options 
each of the guaranteed benefits mentioned above guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying assets 
the total value of all variable annuity contracts has decreased from billion at december  to billion at december  these contract values include gmwb and gmab contracts which have decreased from billion and billion at december  to billion and billion at december   respectively 
at december   the reserves for the gmwb and gmab were billion and million compared to reserves of million and million at december   respectively 
the increase in the reserves for the gmwb and gmab reflect the changes in economic factors impacting the mark to market value of the guarantees 
at december   the reserve for the other variable annuity guaranteed benefits  gmdb and gmib  was million compared to million at december  as a means of economically hedging our obligations under gmwb and gmab provisions  we purchase equity put and call options  enter into interest rate swaps  swaptions and trade equity futures contracts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative instruments 
equity price risk variable annuity riders the variable annuity guaranteed benefits guarantee payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the investment assets 
for this reason  when equity markets decline  the returns from the separate account assets coupled with guaranteed benefit fees from annuity holders may not be sufficient to fund expected payouts 
in that case  reserves must be increased with a negative impact to earnings 
the core derivative instruments with which we hedge the equity price risk of our gmwb and gmab are longer dated put and call derivatives  these core instruments are supplemented with equity futures and total return swaps 
interest rate risk variable annuity riders the gmab and the non life contingent benefits associated with the gmwb provisions create embedded derivatives which are carried at fair value separately from the underlying host variable annuity contract 
changes in fair value of the gmwb and gmab are recorded through earnings with fair value calculated based on projected  discounted cash flows over the life of the contract  including projected  discounted benefits and fees 
increases in interest rates reduce the fair value of the gmwb and gmab liabilities 
the gmwb and gmab interest rate exposure is hedged with a portfolio of longer dated put and call derivatives  interest rate swaps and swaptions 
these derivatives are an alternative to the more customized equity puts we previously used 
we have entered into interest rate swaps according to risk exposures along maturities  thus creating both fixed rate payor and variable rate payor terms 
if interest rates were to increase  we would have to pay more to the swap counterparty  and the fair value of our equity puts would decrease  resulting in a negative impact to our pretax income 
fixed annuities  fixed portion of variable annuities and fixed insurance products interest rate exposures arise primarily with respect to the fixed account portion of annuity and insurance products of riversource life companies and their investment portfolios 
we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products 
premiums and deposits collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed rate securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income 
client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis  repricing or maturity characteristics 
rates credited to clients accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments 
therefore  in an increasing 
table of contents rate environment  higher interest rates are reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets resulting in a reduced spread between the two rates  reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income 
we had billion in reserves in future policy benefits and claims on our consolidated balance sheet at december  to recognize liabilities created by these products 
as of december   we did not hedge this exposure 
as of december   we hedged part of this exposure through the use of swaptions 
as of december   the outstanding derivatives were not significant 
flexible savings and other fixed rate savings products we have interest rate risk from our flexible savings and other fixed rate savings products 
these products are primarily investment certificates generally ranging in amounts from  to million with terms ranging from three to months  as well as other savings products sold through ameriprise bank 
we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products 
payments collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed rate securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income 
client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis  repricing or maturity characteristics 
rates credited to clients generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on underlying investments 
this exposure is not currently hedged although we monitor our investment strategy and make modifications based on our changing liabilities and the expected rate environment 
at december   we had billion in reserves related to our fixed rate certificate products and billion in reserves related to our banking products 
equity indexed annuities our equity indexed annuity product is a single premium annuity issued with an initial term of seven years 
the annuity guarantees the contractholder a minimum return of on of the initial premium or end of prior term accumulation value upon renewal plus a return that is linked to the performance of the s p index 
the equity linked return is based on a participation rate initially set at between and of the s p index  which is guaranteed for the initial seven year term when the contract is held to full term 
of the billion in future policy benefits and claims at december   million relates to the liabilities created by this product 
in  we discontinued new sales of equity indexed annuities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative instruments 
equity price risk equity indexed annuities the equity linked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity markets 
to hedge this exposure  a portion of the proceeds from the sale of equity indexed annuities is used to purchase futures  calls and puts which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts 
in conjunction with purchasing puts we also write puts 
pairing purchased puts with written puts allows us to better match the characteristics of the liability 
interest rate risk equity indexed annuities most of the proceeds from the sale of equity indexed annuities are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the guarantee 
we earn income from the difference between the return earned on invested assets and the guarantee rate credited to customer accounts 
the spread between return earned and amount credited is affected by changes in interest rates 
stock market certificates stock market certificates are purchased for amounts generally from  to million for terms of weeks which can be extended to a maximum of years 
for each term the certificate holder can choose to participate in any percentage increase in the s p index up to a maximum return or choose partial participation in any increase in the s p index plus a fixed rate of interest guaranteed in advance 
if partial participation is selected  the total of equity linked return and guaranteed rate of interest cannot exceed the maximum return 
reserves for our stock market certificates are included in customer deposits on our consolidated balance sheets 
of the billion in customer deposits at december   million pertain to stock market certificates 
equity price risk stock market certificates as with the equity indexed annuities  the equity linked return to investors creates equity price risk exposure 
we seek to minimize this exposure with purchased futures and call spreads that replicate what we must credit to client accounts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative instruments 

table of contents interest rate risk stock market certificates stock market certificates have some interest rate risk as changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the payout to be made to the certificate holder 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency risk through our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and our operations in foreign countries 
we are primarily exposed to changes in british pounds gbp related to our net investment in threadneedle which had million of gbp exposure at december  our primary exposure related to operations in foreign countries is to the gbp and the indian rupee 
we monitor the foreign exchange rates that we have exposure to and enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risk when economically prudent 
at december   the notional value of outstanding contracts and our remaining foreign currency risk related to operations in foreign countries were not material 
interest rate risk on external debt interest rate risk on our external debt is not material 
the interest rate on the billion of senior unsecured notes is fixed and the interest rate on the million of junior notes is fixed until june  we have floating rate debt of million related to our municipal bond inverse floater certificates which is not hedged but on which the interest rate risk to pretax income is not material 
we have floating rate debt of million related to certain consolidated property funds  a portion of which is hedged using interest rate swaps which effectively convert the floating rates to a fixed rate 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio  which includes loans  and through derivative and reinsurance counterparties 
credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligor s continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument or contract 
our potential derivative credit exposure to each counterparty is aggregated with all of our other exposures to the counterparty to determine compliance with established credit guidelines at the time we enter into a derivative transaction 
we manage credit risk through fundamental credit analysis  issuer and industry concentration guidelines  and diversification requirements 
these guidelines and oversight of credit risk are managed through our comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management 
we manage the risk of adverse default experience on these investments by applying disciplined fundamental credit analysis and underwriting standards  prudently limiting exposures to lower quality  higher yielding investments  and diversifying exposures by issuer  industry  region and property type 
for each counterparty or borrowing entity and its affiliates  our exposures from all types of transactions are aggregated and managed in relation to guidelines set by risk tolerance thresholds and external and internal rating quality 
we remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the long term historical average used in pricing 
credit exposures on derivative contracts may take into account netting arrangements and collateral arrangements 
before executing a new type of structure of derivative contract  we determine the variability of the contract s potential market and credit exposures and whether such variability might reasonably be expected to create exposure to a counterparty in excess of established limits 
additionally  we reinsure a portion of the insurance risks associated with our life  disability income  long term care and auto and home insurance products through reinsurance agreements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies 
reinsurance is used in order to limit losses  reduce exposure to large risks and provide additional capacity for future growth 
to manage exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies  the financial condition of reinsurers is evaluated prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties and on a periodic basis during the terms of the treaties 
our insurance companies remain primarily liable as the direct insurers on all risks reinsured 
as of december   our largest reinsurance credit risk related to a long term care coinsurance arrangement between us and a life insurance subsidiary of genworth financial  inc see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on reinsurance
