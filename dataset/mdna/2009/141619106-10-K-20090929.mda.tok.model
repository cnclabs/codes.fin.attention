item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements about our business and operations  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 

table of contents our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors  including the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing interventional treatment systems for vascular disease 
our initial product  the diamondback  is a minimally invasive catheter system for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease  or pad 
we were incorporated as replidyne  inc in delaware in on february   replidyne  inc completed its business combination with cardiovascular systems  inc  a minnesota corporation csi mn  in accordance with the terms of the agreement and plan of merger and reorganization  dated as of november  pursuant to the merger agreement  csi mn continued after the merger as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of replidyne 
replidyne changed its name to cardiovascular systems  inc csi and csi mn merged with and into csi  with csi continuing after the merger as the surviving corporation 
these transactions are referred to herein as the merger 
unless the context otherwise requires  all references herein to the company  csi  we  us and our refer to csi mn prior to the completion of the merger and to csi following the completion of the merger and the name change  and all references to replidyne refer to replidyne prior to the completion of the merger and the name change 
at the closing of the merger  replidyne s net assets  as calculated pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  were approximately million 
as of immediately following the effective time of the merger  former csi mn stockholders owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the combined company  and replidyne stockholders owned approximately of the outstanding common stock of the combined company 
our common stock was accepted for listing on the nasdaq global market under the symbol csii and trading commenced on february  replidyne was a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing  in licensing and commercializing anti infective products 
csi mn was incorporated in minnesota in from to  we engaged in research and development on several different product concepts that were later abandoned 
since  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of the diamondback 
from to  we conducted numerous bench and animal tests in preparation for application submissions to the fda 
we initially focused our testing on providing a solution for coronary in stent restenosis but later changed the focus to pad 
in  we obtained an investigational device exemption from the fda to conduct our pivotal oasis clinical trial  which was completed in january the oasis clinical trial was a prospective center study that involved patients with lesions 
in august  the fda granted us k clearance for the use of the diamondback as a therapy in patients with pad 
we commenced a limited commercial introduction of the diamondback in the united states in september this limited commercial introduction intentionally limited the size of our sales force and the number of customers each member of the sales force served in order to focus on obtaining quality and timely product feedback on initial product usages 
we market the diamondback in the united states through a direct sales force and commenced a full commercial launch in the quarter ended march  we expend significant capital on our sales and marketing efforts to expand our customer base and utilization per customer 
we manufacture the diamondback internally at our facilities 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue but generally decline as we continue our commercialization activities  develop additional product enhancements  increase our manufacturing capacity  and make further regulatory submissions 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the private placement of equity securities and completion of the merger 

table of contents financial overview revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of the diamondback and other ancillary products 
the diamondback system consists of a disposable  single use  low profile catheter that travels over our proprietary viperwire guidewire and an external control unit that powers the system 
our ancillary products include the viperslide tm lubricant  the vipersheath tm introducer sheath  vipertrack tm radiopaque tape  and vipercaddy tm guide wire management 
cost of goods sold 
we assemble the single use catheter with components purchased from third party suppliers  as well as with components manufactured in house 
the control unit and guidewires are purchased from third party suppliers 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive  sales  marketing  finance  information technology  human resources and administrative personnel  including stock based compensation 
other significant expenses include travel and marketing costs  professional fees  and patent expenses 
research and development 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing  enhancement and regulatory approval of our products 
research and development expenses include employee compensation including stock based compensation  supplies and materials  consulting expenses  travel and facilities overhead 
we also incur significant expenses to operate clinical trials  including trial design  third party fees  clinical site reimbursement  data management and travel expenses 
all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
interest income 
interest income is attributed to both interest earned on deposits in investments that consist of money market funds and auction rate securities and the initial fair value and changes in fair value of the auction rate securities put option discussed below 
interest expense 
interest expense results from outstanding debt balances  the issuance of convertible promissory notes  and debt discount amortization 
decretion accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants 
decretion accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants reflects the change in the current estimated fair market value of the preferred stock warrants on a quarterly basis  as determined by management and the board of directors 
decretion accretion is recorded as a decrease increase to redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants in the consolidated balance sheet and a decrease increase to net loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
concurrent with the merger  all preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock and  accordingly  we stopped recording decretion accretion as of the merger date 
gain impairment on investments 
gain impairment on investments reflects the change in the fair value of investments as determined with the assistance of valueknowledge llc  an independent third party valuation firm 
decretion accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
decretion accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock reflects the change in the current estimated fair market value of the preferred stock on a quarterly basis  as determined by management and the board of directors 
decretion accretion is recorded as a decrease increase to redeemable convertible preferred stock in the consolidated balance sheet and a decrease increase to the loss attributable to common stockholders in the consolidated statement of operations 
the redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger with replidyne 
as such  the preferred stockholders forfeited their liquidation preferences and we stopped recording decretion accretion as of the merger date 
net operating loss carryforwards 
we have established valuation allowances to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty about our ability to generate the future taxable income necessary to realize these deferred assets  particularly in light of our historical losses 
the future use of net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on us attaining profitable operations and will be limited in any one year under internal revenue code section due to significant ownership changes as defined in section resulting from our equity financings 

table of contents at june   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately million  which will expire at various dates through fiscal critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect amounts reported in those statements 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventory  investments  stock based compensation  preferred stock and preferred stock warrants are updated as appropriate at least quarterly 
we use authoritative pronouncements  our technical accounting knowledge  cumulative business experience  judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies 
while we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements are appropriate  these estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome 
therefore  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
some of our significant accounting policies require us to make subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered to be critical if it meets both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we sell the majority of our products via direct shipment to hospitals or clinics 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
these criteria are met at the time of delivery when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer 
we record estimated sales returns  discounts and rebates as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
we also consider emerging issues task force bulletin eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in revenue recognition 
this standard addresses the timing and method of revenue recognition for revenue arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
in these cases  we recognize revenue from each element of the arrangement as long as separate values for each element can be determined  we have completed our obligation to deliver or perform on that element  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
provisions for the allowance for doubtful accounts attributed to bad debt are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we have inventories that are principally comprised of capitalized direct labor and manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components  and finished goods 
due to the technological nature of our products  there is a risk of obsolescence to changes in our technology and the market  which is impacted by technological developments and events 
accordingly  we write down our inventories as we become aware of any situation where the carrying amount exceeds the estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demands and market conditions 
the evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  expected product lives  product at risk of expiration  sales levels by product and projections of future sales demand 
investments 
our investments include aaa rated auction rate securities ars issued primarily by state agencies and backed by student loans substantially guaranteed by the federal family education loan program 
table of contents ffelp 
in february  we were informed that there was insufficient demand for auction rate securities  resulting in failed auctions for million of our auction rate securities held at june  and currently  these affected securities are not liquid and will not become liquid until a future auction for these investments are successful  they are redeemed by the issuer  or they mature 
as a result  at june  and  we have classified the fair value of the auction rate securities as a long term asset 
we have collected all interest due on our auction rate securities and have no reason to believe that we will not collect all interest due in the future 
on november   we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  providing rights related to our ars the rights 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined for this purpose as the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights 
however  if the rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
so long as we hold ars  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded ars as investments available for sale 
we recorded unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity deficiency section of the balance sheet 
realized gains and losses were accounted for on the specific identification method 
after accepting the ubs offer  we recorded the ars as trading investments and realized gains and losses are included in earnings 
the rights represent a firm agreement in accordance with sfas  which defines a firm agreement as an agreement with an unrelated party  binding on both parties and usually legally enforceable  with the following characteristics a the agreement specifies all significant terms  including the quantity to be exchanged  the fixed price  and the timing of the transaction  and b the agreement includes a disincentive for nonperformance that is sufficiently large to make performance probable 
the enforceability of the rights results in a put option and should be recognized as a free standing asset separate from the ars 
at june   we recorded million as the fair value of the put option asset with a corresponding credit to interest income 
we considered the expected time until the rights are exercised  carrying costs of the rights  and the expected credit risk attributes of the rights and ubs in their valuation of the put option 
the put option does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument under sfas therefore  we have elected to measure the put option at fair value under sfas  which permits an entity to elect the fair value option for recognized financial assets  in order to match the changes in the fair value of the ars 
as a result  unrealized gains and losses will be included in earnings in future periods 
we determined the fair value of our auction rate securities and quantified the other than temporary impairment loss and the unrealized loss with the assistance of valueknowledge llc  an independent third party valuation firm  which utilized various valuation methods and considered  among other factors  estimates of present value of the auction rate securities based upon expected cash flows  the likelihood and potential timing of issuers of the auction rate securities exercising their redemption rights at par value  the likelihood of a return of liquidity to the market for these securities and the potential to sell the securities in secondary markets 
based on these factors  we recorded impairment of investments for the years ended june  and of million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  as interpreted by sab no 
to account for stock based compensation expense associated with the issuance or amendment of stock options and restricted stock awards 
sfas no 
r requires us to recognize stock based compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments computed at the date of grant 
the fair value of all stock option and restricted awards are expensed in the consolidated statements of operations over the related vesting period 
we calculate the fair value on the date of grant using a black scholes model 
to determine the inputs for the black scholes option pricing model  we are required to develop several assumptions  which are highly subjective 
these assumptions include our common stock s volatility  
table of contents the length of our options lives  which is based on future exercises and cancellations  the number of shares of common stock pursuant to which options which will ultimately be forfeited  the risk free rate of return  and future dividends 
prior to the consummation of the merger  we used comparable public company data to determine volatility for option grants 
since we have a limited history of stock purchase and sale activity  expected volatility is based on historical data from several public companies similar to us in size and nature of operations 
we will continue to use comparable public company data to determine expected volatility for option grants until our historical volatility is relevant to measure 
we use a weighted average calculation to estimate the time our options will be outstanding 
we estimated the number of options that are expected to be forfeited based on our historical experience 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
we use our judgment and expectations in setting future dividend rates  which is currently expected to be zero 
all options we have granted become exercisable over periods established at the date of grant 
the option exercise price is generally not less than the estimated fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant  as determined by management and board of directors 
the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the merger required our management and board of directors to estimate the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting options and for determining stock based compensation expense 
in response to these requirements  prior to the merger our management and board of directors estimated the fair market value of common stock at each date at which options are granted based upon stock valuations and other qualitative factors 
our management and board of directors conducted stock valuations using two different valuation methods the option pricing method and the probability weighted expected return method 
both of these valuation methods took into consideration the following factors financing activity  rights and preferences of our preferred stock  growth of the executive management team  clinical trial activity  the fda process  the status of our commercial launch  our mergers and acquisitions and public offering processes  revenues  the valuations of comparable public companies  our cash and working capital amounts  and additional objective and subjective factors relating to our business 
our management and board of directors set the exercise prices for option grants based upon their best estimate of the fair market value of the common stock at the time they made such grants  taking into account all information available at those times 
in some cases  management and the board of directors made retrospective assessments of the valuation of the common stock at later dates and determined that the fair market value of the common stock at the times the grants were made was different than the exercise prices established for those grants 
in cases in which the fair market was higher than the exercise price  we recognized stock based compensation expense for the excess of the fair market value of the common stock over the exercise price 
following the merger  our stock valuations are based upon the market price for our common stock 
preferred stock 
we record the current estimated fair value of our convertible preferred stock on a quarterly basis based on the fair market value of that stock as determined by our management and board of directors 
the determination of fair market value included factors such as recent financing activity  preferred stock rights and preferences  clinical trials  revenues  and regulatory approval process 
in accordance with accounting series release no 
 presentation in financial statements of redeemable preferred stocks and eitf abstracts  topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities  we record changes in the current fair value of our redeemable convertible preferred stock in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity deficiency and comprehensive loss income and consolidated statements of operations as accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
concurrent with the merger  all preferred stock was converted to common stock and  accordingly  was reclassified to stockholders equity deficiency 
preferred stock warrants 
freestanding warrants and other similar instruments related to shares that are redeemable are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and its related interpretations 
under sfas no 
 the freestanding warrant that is related to our redeemable convertible preferred stock was classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
table of contents as of june  the warrant was subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of other income expense 
fair value was measured using the black scholes option pricing model 
concurrent with the merger  all preferred stock warrants were converted into warrants to purchase common stock and  accordingly  the liability was reclassified to stockholders equity deficiency

revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of the diamondback during the year ended june  compared to three quarters in the year ended june  as of june   we had a person direct sales organization that was selling the diamondback in accounts 
as of june   we had an person direct sales organization that was selling the diamondback in accounts

cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  these amounts represent the cost of materials  labor and overhead for single use catheters  guidewires  control units  and other ancillary products 
the increase in gross margin from the year ended june  to june  is primarily due to increased volume  
table of contents manufacturing efficiencies  and product cost reductions 
cost of goods sold for the years ended june  and includes  and  respectively  for stock based compensation 
we expect that cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues will decline in the future as sales volumes increase  although quarterly fluctuations could occur based on timing of new product introductions  sales mix  unanticipated warranty claims  or other unanticipated circumstances 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  the primary reasons for the increase included the building of our sales and marketing team  contributing million  increased consulting and professional services  including million in previously capitalized initial public offering costs  contributing million  and payroll related expenses related to building our administrative team  contributing million 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the years ended june  and includes million and million  respectively  for stock based compensation 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future due primarily to the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing organization to further commercialize our products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  research and development expenses relate to specific projects to improve our product or expand into new markets  such as the development of a new control unit  shaft designs  crown designs  and pad and coronary clinical trials 
the reduction in expense related to costs of a coronary clinical trial occurring during the year ended june   along with fewer pad development projects in research and development for the years ended june  and includes  and  respectively  for stock based compensation 
as we continue to expand our product portfolio within the market for the treatment of peripheral arteries and leverage our core technology into the coronary market  we expect to incur research and development expenses at a similar rate as for the year ended june   although fluctuations could occur based on the number of projects and studies and the timing of expenditures 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  from  for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  interest expense for the year ended june  consisted of the amortization of debt discount of million and interest on outstanding debt facilities of million 
interest income 
interest income increased by million  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the impact of recording the put option asset of million related to our auction rate securities 
this was offset by lower average cash and cash equivalent balances along with reduced yields

comparison of fiscal year ended june  with fiscal year ended june  revenues 
we generated revenues of million during the year ended june  attributable to sales of the diamondback to customers following fda clearance in august we commenced a limited commercial introduction of the diamondback in the united states in september  followed by a full commercial launch in the quarter ended march  since september  we expanded our sales and marketing efforts and shipped more than  single use catheters through june  we applied eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the primary impact of which was to treat the diamondback as a single unit of accounting for initial customer orders 
as such  revenues were deferred until the title and risk of loss of each diamondback component  consisting of catheters  guidewires  and a control unit  were transferred to the customer based on the shipping terms 
many initial shipments to customers also included a loaner control unit  which we provided  until the new control unit received clearance from the fda and was subsequently available for sale 
cost of goods sold 
for the year ended june   cost of goods sold was million 
this amount represents the cost of materials  labor and overhead for single use catheters  guidewires and control units shipped subsequent to obtaining fda clearance for the diamondback in august cost of goods sold for the year ended june  includes  for stock based compensation 
for the year ended june   there was no cost of goods sold due to revenues not occurring until the year ended june  selling  general and administrative expenses

during the year ended june   net cash used in operations amounted to million 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have historically funded our operating losses primarily from the issuance of common and preferred stock  convertible promissory notes  and debt 
we have incurred negative cash flows and net losses since inception 
on february   we completed the merger  in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement 
at closing  replidyne s net assets  as calculated pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  were approximately million 
in february  we were notified that recent conditions in the global credit markets have caused insufficient demand for auction rate securities  resulting in failed auctions for million of our auction rate securities held at june  and these securities are currently not liquid  as we have an inability to sell the securities due to continued failed auctions 
on march   we obtained a margin loan from ubs financial services  inc  the entity through which we originally purchased our auction rate securities  for up to million  which was secured by the million par value of our auction rate securities 
the outstanding balance on this loan at june  was million 
on august   we replaced this loan with a margin loan from ubs bank usa  which increased maximum borrowings available to million  which may be adjusted from time to time by ubs bank in its sole discretion 
the margin loan bears interest at variable rates that equal the lesser of i day libor plus or ii the applicable reset rate  maximum auction rate or similar rate as specified in the prospectus or other documentation governing the pledged taxable student loan auction rate securities  however  interest expense charged on the loan will not exceed interest income earned on the auction rate securities 
the loan is due on demand and ubs bank will require us to repay it in full from the proceeds received from a public equity offering where net proceeds exceed million 
in addition  if at any time any of our auction rate securities may be sold  exchanged  redeemed  transferred or otherwise conveyed for no less than their par value by ubs  then we must immediately effect such a transfer and the proceeds must be used to pay down outstanding borrowings under this loan 
the margin requirements are determined by ubs bank and are subject to change 
from august   the date this loan was initially funded  through june   the margin requirements included maximum borrowings  including interest  of million 
if these margin requirements are not maintained  ubs bank may require us to make a loan payment in an amount necessary to comply with the applicable margin requirements or demand repayment of the entire outstanding balance 
we have maintained the margin requirements under the loans from both ubs entities 
the outstanding balance on this loan at june  was million 
on september   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank with maximum available borrowings of million  which agreement was amended on february  and april  the agreement includes a million term loan  a million accounts receivable line of credit  and a million term loan that reduces availability of borrowings on the accounts receivable line of credit 
the terms of each of these loans are as follows the million term loan has a fixed interest rate of and a final payment amount equal to of the loan amount due at maturity 
this term loan has a month maturity  with repayment terms that include interest only payments during the first six months followed by equal principal and interest payments 
this term loan also includes an acceleration provision that requires us to pay the entire outstanding balance  plus a penalty ranging from to of the principal amount  upon prepayment or the occurrence and continuance of an event of default 
as part of the term loan agreement  we granted silicon valley bank a warrant to purchase  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of per share 
this warrant was assigned a value of  for accounting purposes  is immediately exercisable  and expires ten years after issuance 
the balance outstanding on the term loan at june  was million 

table of contents the accounts receivable line of credit has a two year maturity and a floating interest rate equal to the prime rate  plus  with an interest rate floor of 
interest on borrowings is due monthly and the principal balance is due at maturity 
borrowings on the line of credit are based on of eligible domestic receivables  which is defined as receivables aged less than days from the invoice date along with specific exclusions for contra accounts  concentrations  and government receivables 
accounts receivable receipts are deposited into a lockbox account in the name of silicon valley bank 
the accounts receivable line of credit is subject to non use fees  annual fees  cancellation fees  and maintaining a minimum liquidity ratio 
there was no balance outstanding on the line of credit at june  on april   the accounts receivable line of credit was amended to allow for an increase in borrowings from million to million 
all other terms and conditions of the original line of credit agreement remain in place 
the million term loan reduces available borrowings under the line of credit agreement 
the million term loan was originally two guaranteed term loans each with a one year maturity 
each of the guaranteed term loans had a floating interest rate equal to the prime rate  plus  with an interest rate floor of 
interest on borrowings were due monthly and the principal balance was due at maturity 
one of our directors and stockholders and two entities who held preferred shares and were also affiliated with two of our directors agreed to act as guarantors of these term loans 
in consideration for guarantees  we issued the guarantors warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on april   the guaranteed term loans were refinanced into a million term loan that has a fixed interest rate of and a final payment amount equal to of the loan amount due at maturity 
as a result of the refinancing  the guarantees on the original term loans have been released 
this term loan has a month maturity  with repayment terms that include equal monthly payments of principal and interest beginning june  this term loan also includes an acceleration provision that requires us to pay the entire outstanding balance  plus a penalty ranging from to of the principal amount  upon prepayment or the occurrence and continuance of an event of default 
the term loan reduces available borrowings under the amended accounts receivable line of credit agreement 
the balance outstanding on the guaranteed term loans at june  was million excluding debt discount of million 
the guaranteed term loans and common stock warrants were allocated using the relative fair value method 
under this method  we estimated the fair value of the term loans without the guarantees and calculated the fair value of the common stock warrants using the black scholes method 
the relative fair value of the loans and warrants were applied to the loan proceeds of million resulting in an assigned value of million for the loans and million for the warrants

table of contents government insures loans in the ffelp so that lenders are reimbursed at least of the loan s outstanding principal and accrued interest if a borrower defaults 
approximately of the par value of our auction rate securities is supported by student loan assets that are guaranteed by the federal government under the ffelp 
in february  we were informed that there was insufficient demand for auction rate securities  resulting in failed auctions for million of our auction rate securities held at june  and currently  these affected securities are not liquid and will not become liquid until a future auction for these investments is successful  they are redeemed by the issuer  they mature  or they are repurchased by ubs 
as a result  we have determined the fair value of our auction rate securities at june  to be million and have classified them as a long term asset 
we determined the fair value of our auction rate securities with the assistance of valueknowledge llc  an independent third party valuation firm  which utilized various valuation methods and considered  among other factors  estimates of present value of the auction rate securities based upon expected cash flows  the likelihood and potential timing of issuers of the auction rate securities exercising their redemption rights at par value  the likelihood of a return of liquidity to the market for these securities and the potential to sell the securities in secondary markets 
on november   we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  providing rights related to our auction rate securities the rights 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our auction rate securities at par value  which is defined for this purpose as the liquidation preference of the auction rate securities plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our auction rate securities at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our auction rates securities under the rights 
however  if the rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our auction rate securities 
at june   we have determined the fair value of our auction rate security rights to be million and have classified them as a long term asset 
so long as we hold auction rate securities  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the auction rate securities if the auction process fails
