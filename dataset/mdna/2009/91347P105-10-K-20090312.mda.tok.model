item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in section a of this report  entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in flat panel display  solid state lighting and other applications 
since  we have been exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
our revenues are generated through contract research  sales of development and commercial chemicals  license fees and royalties  technology development and evaluation agreements  and commercialization assistance agreements 
in the future  we anticipate that the revenues from licensing our intellectual property will become a more significant part of our revenue stream 
while we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of oled technologies pholed  toled  foled  etc 
and materials  we have incurred significant losses and will likely continue to do so until our oled technologies and materials become more widely adopted by product manufacturers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties  as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation  the timing and volume of sales of our oled materials for both commercial usage and evaluation purposes  the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities  and the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees  valuation of acquired technology and stock based compensation  as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the sec 
these policies  which have been reviewed with our audit committee  are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred license fees contract research revenue represents reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenue is recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenue associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we receive non refundable cash payments under certain development and technology evaluation agreements with our customers 
these payments are generally recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement 
on occasion  however  these payments are creditable against license fees and or royalties payable by the customer if a license agreement is subsequently executed with the customer 
these payments are classified as deferred license fees or deferred revenues  and are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet until such time as revenue can be recognized 
revenue is deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement with the customer 
if a license agreement is executed  these payments are recorded as revenue over the estimated useful life of the licensed technology and the revenue is classified based on the terms of the license 
otherwise  these payments are recorded as revenue at the time negotiations with the customer show that there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement 
if we used different estimates for the useful life of the licensed technology  reported revenue during the relevant period would differ 
as of december    was recorded as deferred license fees and deferred revenue  of which  may be recognized under license agreements that have not yet been executed or deemed effective 
valuation of acquired technology we regularly review our acquired oled technologies for events or changes in circumstances that might indicate the value of these technologies may have been impaired 
factors considered important that could cause impairment include  among others  significant changes in our anticipated future use of these technologies and our overall business strategy as it pertains to these technologies  particularly in light of patents owned by others in the same field of use 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the long lived asset should be written down to fair value 
measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies  as deemed appropriate 
as of december   we believe that no revision of the remaining useful lives or write down of our acquired technology was required for  nor was such a revision needed in or the net book value of our acquired technology was  as of december valuation of stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and directors 
we account for our stock option and warrant grants to non employees in exchange for goods or services in accordance with sfas no 
r and emerging issues task force eitf 
sfas no 
r and eitf require that we record an expense for our option and warrant grants to non employees based on the fair value of the options and warrants  which is remeasured over the vesting period of such awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options we have granted for purposes of recording charges to the statement of operations 
in order to calculate the fair value of the options  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including expected volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected option life 
although we use available resources and information when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation of future grants or the remeasurement of non employee awards 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses of  and a decrease in interest income of  our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in commercial revenue increased to  for from  for commercial revenue relates to the incorporation our oled technologies and materials into our customers commercial products  and includes commercial chemical revenue  royalty and license revenues  and commercialization assistance revenue 
developmental revenue decreased to  for from  for developmental revenue relates to oled technology and material development activities for which we are paid  and includes contract research revenue  development chemical revenue and technology development revenue 
we believe these revenue categories  which now combine accounts previously reported separately  better reflect our business strategies and core business efforts 
our commercial chemical revenue and our royalty and license revenues for the year ended december  were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for the same period in for the year ended december   the majority of our commercial chemical revenue and our royalty and license revenues were from samsung sdi co  ltd  whose oled business was transferred to samsung mobile display co  ltd 
samsung smd in september samsung smd represented approximately of our commercial revenue and approximately of our total revenue in we also recorded commercial chemical revenue and license revenue from sales of small quantities of our proprietary oled materials to two other commercial chemical customers during the year 
for the year ended december   the majority of our commercial chemical revenue and our royalty and license revenues were also from samsung smd 
for  we also recorded commercial chemical revenue and license revenue from sales of small quantities of our proprietary oled materials to three other commercial chemical customers 
we cannot accurately predict how long our material sales to samsung smd or other customers will continue  as they frequently update and alter their product offerings 
continued sales of our oled materials to these customers will depend on several factors  including  pricing  availability  continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings 
we recorded royalty revenue of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase in royalty revenue was due mainly to increased sales of licensed products by samsung smd 
for both and  we received royalty revenue from samsung smd under a patent license agreement entered into in april under this agreement  we receive royalty reports at a specified period of time after the end of the quarter during which royalty bearing products are sold by samsung smd 
consequently  our royalty revenues from samsung smd for the years ended december  and represent royalties for licensed products sold by samsung smd during the month periods ended september  and  respectively 
in addition  we recorded a small amount of royalty revenue from two other customers in license revenue for the years ended december  and included license fees of  and  respectively 
for both years  we received license revenue under our patent license agreement with samsung smd and under a cross license agreement we executed with dupont displays  inc dupont in december license revenue for the year ended december  also included amounts received under a patent license agreement we entered into with konica minolta holdings  inc konica minolta in august  a joint development agreement we previously entered into with a subsidiary of konica minolta  and two other agreements we entered into during the fourth quarter of under our agreements with samsung smd  dupont and konica minolta  we received upfront payments that have been classified as deferred license fees and deferred revenue 
the deferred license fees are being recognized as license revenue over the term of the agreement with samsung smd and  based on current assumptions  over years with dupont and konica minolta 
commercial revenue for the year ended december  also included  in commercialization assistance revenue that we received under a business support agreement executed during the fourth quarter of we received no such revenue for the year ended december  we earned  in contract research revenue from agencies of the us government for the year ended december   compared to  in corresponding revenue for the same period in the decrease was due principally to the timing of work performed and costs incurred in connection with several new and completed government programs during however  the overall value of our government contracts remained relatively constant during both years 
we earned  in development chemical revenue for the year ended december   compared to  in corresponding revenue for the year ended december  our development chemical customer base increased significantly during  as did the average dollar value of development chemical sales per customer 
we cannot accurately predict the timing and frequency of development chemical purchases by our customers due to participants in the oled industry having differing oled technology development and product launch strategies  which are subject to change at any time 
we recognized  in technology development revenue for the year ended december   compared to  in corresponding revenue for the same period in technology development revenue for included amounts received under a new joint development agreement we entered into in august payments received under this new agreement are classified as deferred revenue and are being recognized as technology development revenue over a period of three years 
during  we completed work on a major joint development program with another customer 
payments received under this agreement accounted for all of our technology development revenue for in  we began work on two new joint development programs with this customer  but neither of these programs is as large as the program completed in technology development revenue for also included amounts received for a technical assistance program that began in november the amount and timing of our receipt of fees for technology development and similar services is difficult to predict due to participants in the oled industry having different technology development strategies  which are subject to change at any time 
we received  and  in cash payments during and  respectively  from various customers for license rights granted to these customers  and or for joint development work performed or technical assistance provided at the request of these customers 
these payments were recorded as deferred revenue and deferred license fees and we are recognizing these over the life of the agreements to which they relate 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to an increase in patent costs of  an increase of  attributable to higher operating costs associated with our ewing facility  and an increase of  in personnel costs due mainly to increased personnel during general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was mainly due to an increase of  in personnel costs 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the decrease was mainly attributable to decreased rates of return on investments during  compared to rates of return during due to current market conditions  we anticipate that these lower rates of return will continue for the foreseeable future 
during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  from our sale of these nols and research and development tax credits  and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
in  we received proceeds of  from corresponding sales of approximately million in nols and research and development tax credits 
we expect to sell a similar quantity of nols and tax credits to new jersey under the program in  if approved 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in revenues of  and an increase in operating expenses of  the increase in operating loss was offset to some extent by an increase of  in interest income 
the decrease in net loss per diluted share  despite the increase in total net loss  resulted from an increase in the weighted average number of shares of our common stock outstanding in  as compared to our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  commercial revenue increased to  for from  for developmental revenue decreased to  in from  for our commercial chemical revenue and our royalty and license revenues for the year ended december  were  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for the same period in the increase in commercial chemical revenue was due to increased purchases of our proprietary oled materials for use in commercial oled products 
in the fourth quarter of  we began supplying our proprietary oled materials to samsung smd for use in a commercial active matrix oled display product 
this activity continued in  with samsung smd being responsible for the vast majority of our commercial chemical revenue for the year 
as discussed further below  we also began recognizing royalty revenue from samsung smd in in  we began supplying our proprietary oled materials to chi mei el corporation and lg display co  ltd 
formerly lg 
philips co  ltd  with whom we signed commercial supply agreements during the year 
these agreements are similar to the agreement we had entered into with au optronics corporation  in that we record both commercial chemical revenue and license revenue from our sales of oled materials under these agreements 
a small portion of our commercial chemical revenue and our license revenue for were from sales of our proprietary oled materials to chi mei el and lg display 
for the first seven months of  we supplied one of our proprietary oled materials to au optronics for use in a commercial oled display product 
for  we recognized commercial chemical revenue of  and license revenue of  on account of our sales of this material to au optronics 
however  those sales ended when au optronics discontinued manufacturing its commercial oled display product during the third quarter of commercial chemical revenue and license revenue from sales of our proprietary oled material to au optronics represented a substantial component of our revenues for our royalty and license revenues for decreased substantially from due in large part to the difference in our business agreements with samsung smd and au optronics 
as previously indicated  under the terms of our agreement with au optronics we recognized license revenue at the time we sold our proprietary oled material to au optronics 
in contrast  under the terms of our agreement with samsung smd  we recognize royalty revenue when samsung smd reports to us the sale of licensed products that use our proprietary oled materials or technologies 
this can occur up to six months or more after the date on which we sell our oled materials to samsung smd 
for  we recognized  in royalty revenue on account of sales of these licensed products reported to us by samsung smd for the first three quarters of the year 
there was no corresponding royalty revenue reported to us by samsung smd for our royalty and license revenues for did  however  include license fees and upfront royalty payments received under our patent license agreement with samsung smd  as well as license fees received under our cross license agreement executed with dupont 
all of these payments have been classified as deferred revenue 
the deferred license fees are being recognized as license revenue over the life of our agreement with samsung smd  and over years for our agreement with dupont 
the deferred royalties are being recognized as royalty revenue when sales of licensed products are reported to us by samsung smd 
we earned  in contract research revenue from agencies of the us government for the year ended december   compared to  in corresponding revenue for the same period in the increase was mainly attributable to increased work performed under our government contracts and the achievement of milestones as specified within certain of those contracts 
we commenced work on new government contracts during and completed work on eight government programs during the year 
we earned  in development chemical revenue for the year ended december   compared to  in corresponding revenue for the year ended december  the decrease was mainly due to a decreased volume of development chemical purchases as a result of samsung smd transitioning from exclusively development chemical purchases in to primarily commercial chemical purchases in we recognized  in technology development revenue for the year ended december   compared to  in corresponding revenue for the same period in technology development revenue for was derived from one technology development contract that we renewed and continued working under for the entire year 
for  we derived technology development revenue from this and three other contracts for technology development and similar services 
although in we continued working with all of the companies from which we derived technology development revenue for  our business arrangements with these companies changed as the oled industry evolved and our customers refined their technology development strategies 
for example  we received a non refundable payment for the continuation of one of these technology development agreements in the third quarter of  which payment is creditable against future amounts payable under a commercial license agreement with the customer  if one is executed by a specified date 
due to this business arrangement  the payment has been recorded as deferred license fees rather than technology development revenue 
the amount and timing of our receipt of fees for technology development and similar services is difficult to predict due to business changes such as this one  and participants in the oled industry having different technology development strategies  which are subject to change at any time 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was mainly due to an increase of  attributable to higher operating costs associated with our ewing facility  a refund received from princeton university in for unspent research and development funds of  and an increase of  in personnel costs due mainly to increased salaries during  and an increase of  relating to the recognition of expenses for stock issuances to non employee members of our scientific advisory board  and for the vesting of shares of restricted stock previously issued to these individuals 
the increase was offset to some extent by a decrease of  in amounts paid to ppg industries under our oled materials supply and service agreement  as we started performing at our ewing facility certain the work previously performed for us by ppg industries 
general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was mainly due to an increase of  in personnel costs due mainly to increased salaries during  and an increase of  attributable to higher operating costs associated with our ewing facility 
royalty and license expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the decrease was due to a reduction of  in royalties owed to motorola 
for  we had a minimum royalty obligation to motorola of  beginning with  however  we were no longer required to make minimum royalty payments to motorola 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the increase was mainly attributable to increased cash for investment due to funds received from a common stock offering that we completed in may  as well as higher rates of return on investments during during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax nols and approximately  of our research and development tax credits under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  from our sale of these nols and research and development tax credits  and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
in  we received proceeds of  from corresponding sales of approximately million in nols and research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  for a total of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  for a total of  as of december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of  was primarily due to the usage of cash in operating activities 
cash used in operating activities was  for  compared to  for the decreased usage of cash in operating activities was mainly due to a net increase in deferred license fees and deferred revenue of  related to cash payments from various customers for license rights granted to these customers  and or joint development work performed or technical assistance provided at the request of these customers 
cash provided by investing activities was  for  compared to  of cash used in investing activities for in we increased our net investments by  primarily from the investment of the proceeds from the sale of common stock 
there were no stock sales in cash provided by financing activities was  for  as compared to  for in may the company completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the offering resulted in proceeds to us of  net of  in underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs associated with completion of the offering 
working capital decreased to  as of december   from  as of december  the decrease was mainly due to the use of cash and cash equivalents of  an increase in accounts payable of  an increase in accrued expenses of  and a net increase in deferred license fees and deferred revenue of  we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance and defense of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations through at least we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants and options 
it should be noted  however  that additional funding may be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain  maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  particularly in the current economic environment 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years sponsored research obligation minimum royalty obligation  year total  year under our amended license agreement with princeton university  the university of southern california and the university of michigan  we are obligated to pay minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect 
the agreement has no scheduled expiration date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in control of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets  or obligations including contingent obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
as such  a change in interest rates of percentage point would not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows 
our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on investments
