table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide complex solutions for satellite command and control  integration and test  data processing  signals analysis  interference detection and geolocation  and flight simulation 
we design  develop  and integrate sophisticated solutions and provide services related to satellite ground systems and other communications and networking equipment 
we believe that our integration capability is unique  as we have developed and own the key technologies used in our solutions 
by controlling these pivotal technologies  we believe that we are able to provide solutions at significantly lower risk  lower cost  and on accelerated delivery schedules as compared to our competitors 
since our founding in  we have supported more than different satellite missions for both commercial and government customers who perform communications  science  meteorology  and earth resource applications and our systems are utilized worldwide 
integral systems leading edge technologies  algorithms  and integration processes are based on a commercial model that we have used to bring efficiencies into the government market  which is now our largest source of revenue 
we believe that our blend of commercial and government customers  mature systems integration methodologies  and mix of software and hardware products positions us for sustained growth 
effective with the first quarter of our fiscal year  it is now our practice to close our books and records on the friday prior to the calendar quarter end for interim periods  to align our financial closing with our business processes 
we also changed our fiscal year end date to the last friday of september of each year 
this change is effective beginning with the current fiscal year  resulting in our fiscal year ending on september  we do not believe this change materially affects the comparability of the quarters and twelve month periods presented within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we measure financial performance for each operating segment based on income from operations  which consists of revenue less cost of revenue  selling  general administrative  research development  and intangible asset amortization expenses 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we realigned our space communications systems segment to include the operations of our sat subsidiary 
the signal monitoring products sold by sat are better aligned with the product offerings of the space communications systems segment 
sat was previously included in the commercial systems segment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  asc intangibles goodwill other  we previously completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of the last day of the fiscal year including fiscal year 
effective august   we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment testing to the first day of the fourth quarter in order to provide additional time to quantify the fair value of our reporting units and if necessary to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
this change in timing also reduces the likelihood that the annual impairment analysis would not be completed by the filing date of our annual financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
asc  we will also perform interim impairment testing should circumstances requiring it arise 
we believe the resulting change in accounting policy related to the annual testing date will not delay  accelerate  or avoid an impairment charge 
we determined that the change in accounting policy related to the annual testing date is preferable under the circumstances and does not result in adjustments to our financial statements when applied retrospectively 
this section may contain forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
our projections may not in fact be achieved and these projections do not reflect any acquisitions or divestitures that may occur in the future 
reference should be made to the various important factors listed under the heading forward looking statements that could cause actual future results to differ materially 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex  or subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies  which relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of goodwill and other long lived assets  stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  and the recoverability of deferred tax assets  are discussed below 
contract accounting revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the purchase price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn revenue from three types of arrangements contracts that include software  hardware and engineering services to build satellite ground and communications equipment and systems  software and services typically post contract support services pcs  and software only sales 
typically contracts are cost plus fixed fee or award fee  fixed price  or time and material contracts 
the following table summarizes the percentage of revenues attributable to each contract type for the period indicated fiscal years ended september  september  contract type cost plus incentive or award fee fixed price time and materials we recognize software license arrangements that include significant modification and customization of the software in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition asc software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions by applying the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  asc revenue recognition construction type production type contracts 
such software license arrangements are generally included in our system build revenue  which is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the costs incurred as a percentage of the total estimated costs to complete 
when total cost estimates exceed revenue  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and anticipated changes in estimated salaries and other costs 
incentives and award payments are included in estimated total contract value used in the percentage of completion method when the realization of such amounts is deemed probable upon achievement of certain defined goals 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs are continuously monitored during the terms of the contracts and are subject to revision as the contracts progress 
when revisions in estimated contract revenue and costs are determined  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are first identified 
revenue arrangements entered into with the same customer that are accounted for under sop are accounted for on a combined basis when they i are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective  ii essentially represent an agreement to do a single project  iii involve interrelated activities with substantial common costs  and iv are performed concurrently or sequentially 

table of contents when we enter into multiple element software arrangements  which may include any combination of hardware  software or services  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements based on their relative fair value 
for software  and elements for which software is essential to the functionality  the allocation is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately  and for software license updates and software support services it is based upon the rates when renewed 
there may be cases in which there is vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements 
in these cases  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements 
we have established vsoe on our post contract support services and recognize revenue on this element on a straight line basis over the period of performance 
we recognize revenue on delivered elements only if i any undelivered products or services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered products or services  ii we have an enforceable claim to receive the amount due in the event we do not deliver the undelivered products or services  iii there is evidence of the fair value for each undelivered product or service  and iv the revenue recognition criteria otherwise have been met for the delivered elements 
otherwise  revenue on delivered elements is recognized when the undelivered elements are delivered 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
revenue for general services or non software product sales are recognized as work is performed or products delivered and amounts are earned in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  asc revenue recognition overall 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverable  revenue may be recognized on a straight line basis over the service period  on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables products have been delivered 
revenue arrangements entered into with the same customer that are accounted for under sab are accounted for on a combined basis when they are entered into at or near the same time  unless it is clearly evident that the contracts are not related to one another 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset group is considered impaired when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying value 
we measure impairment based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
fair value is determined primarily using the projected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose 
the estimates of expected cash flows require use to make significant judgment regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in a material charge to the results of operations 
impairment of goodwill we have recorded goodwill in connection with our mergers and acquisitions of million as of september  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net working capital  property and equipment  and separately reportable intangible assets 
the tangible assets  intangible assets  and goodwill acquired are then assigned to reporting units pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 business combinations  asc business combinations 
goodwill is then tested for impairment at least annually for each reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test is performed in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets asc intangibles goodwill and other 
step one of the goodwill 
table of contents impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further testing is required 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a step two test must be performed 
step two includes estimating the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets including intangible assets that may not be reflected on the company s books 
the fair value of goodwill is then estimated by subtracting the fair value of tangible and intangible assets from the fair value of total assets determined in step one 
the goodwill impairment is the excess of the recorded goodwill over the estimated fair value of goodwill 
there are no active or inactive markets for our reporting units and accordingly  the valuation process is similar to the valuation of a closely held company and considers valuation methods that are market based  income based  and cost based 
income based methods will generally include the use of a discounted cash flow method and market based methods will generally include a guideline public company method and comparative merger and acquisition method 
the application of valuation methods requires judgment regarding appropriate inputs and assumptions and results in our best estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit 
as with any estimate  inputs and assumptions can be subject to varying degrees of uncertainty 
reasonable informed market participants can differ in their perception of value for a reporting unit  and  accordingly  these uncertainties cannot be fully resolved prior to engaging in an actual selling effort 
effective august   we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment testing to the first day of the fourth quarter 
based on the impairment test as of june   we had one reporting unit  lumistar  for which the goodwill has been determined to be at risk ie  there is a reasonable possibility that the reporting unit might fail a future step one impairment test under asc 
the estimated fair value of equity of the lumistar reporting unit as of june  was above its carrying value 
accordingly  a step two impairment test was not performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
the amount of goodwill allocated to this reporting unit was million 
the fair value of the lumistar reporting unit was estimated principally based on the discounted cash flow method and the guideline public company method 
the discounted cash flow method was applied using an estimated market based discount rate to the projected after tax cash flows for the reporting unit 
the guideline public company method was applied using an estimated market based multiple to the reporting unit s estimated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
the key assumptions that drive the estimated fair value of the reporting unit include expected future sales and margins  expected future growth rates of sales and expenses  and market based inputs for discount rates and ebitda multiples 
we acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding the key assumptions that drive the estimated fair value of the lumistar reporting unit 
any material negative change in the fundamental outlook for the lumistar reporting unit  its industry or the capital market environment could cause the reporting unit to fail step one 
accordingly  we will be monitoring events and circumstances each quarter prior to the annual testing date to determine whether an additional goodwill impairment test should be performed 
if the lumistar reporting unit were to fail the step one test  the goodwill impairment will likely exceed the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value because the reporting unit does not carry any intangible asset balances that would be considered in step two when computing the implied fair value of goodwill 
we reviewed the internal and external factors affecting the fair value assumptions of the lumistar reporting unit as of september  based on this review  we did not identify any indication of a decline in fair value from june  and we have concluded that no further impairment testing was necessary as of september  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest  and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting or the achievement of specific performance conditions 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses from the existing accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances  including the credit worthiness of each customer and the period in which customers financial condition deteriorate and they are no longer able to pay the balances owed to us 
we determine the allowance based on historical experience  review of specific accounts  and significant past due balances of greater than three months 
account balances are written off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and recovery is considered remote 
deferred income taxes we recognize a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences as well as the effects of any net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that may be utilized to reduce future taxes payable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates  and future tax rate changes are not anticipated 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  the reversal of temporary differences  the forecasts of future taxable income from operations and investments  and ongoing feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require management judgment and are updated periodically based on current business conditions which affect us and overall economic conditions and are consistent with estimates being used to manage the business 
if it is determined more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  we would record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would decrease income in the period such determination is made 
accounting policy change in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fasb accounting standards codification asc intangibles goodwill other  we previously completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of the last day of the fiscal year including fiscal year

this change in timing also reduces the likelihood that the annual impairment analysis would not be completed by the filing date of our annual financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we will also perform interim impairment testing should circumstances requiring it arise

 accounting for defensive intangible assets asc intangibles goodwill other 
this issue summary requires that a defensive intangible asset be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting and assigned a useful life which reflects the entity s consumption of the expected benefits related to that asset 
a defensive intangible asset is an acquired intangible asset which the acquirer does not intend to actively use  but intends to hold to prevent others from obtaining access to the asset  excluding intangible assets that are used in research and development 
an entity s benefit from holding a defensive intangible asset is the direct and indirect cash flows resulting from the entity preventing others from realizing any value from the intangible assets 
the period over which a defensive asset diminishes in fair value can be used as a proxy for the entity s consumption of the expected benefits related to the asset

table of contents fiscal year ended september  fiscal year compared to fiscal year ended september  fiscal year revenue consolidated revenue decreased slightly from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the decrease in revenue primarily related to the following government systems revenue was million in fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal year in fiscal year  our government systems segment represented of total revenue  compared to in fiscal year included in contract service revenue is a revenue rate reserve of million established during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  offset by increases in contract services revenue from performance on contract work 
revenue from our government systems cost plus contracts are driven by pricing based on cost incurred to perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulation  which provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services and allowability and allocability of costs to contracts awarded by the us government 
we have incurred allocable costs that we believe are allowable and reimbursable under our cost plus fee contracts  and are included in our revenue 
these costs are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency dcaa  therefore revenue recognized on our cost plus contracts is subject to adjustment upon audit by the dcaa 
in late october  we received an unexpected notice from the dcaa indicating that it was disallowing a majority of our product development costs for reimbursement 
this caused us to increase our revenue reserve to million based on the potential risk of unfavorable audit adjustment 
we are discussing this issue with the dcaa and  while no assurance can be given  we are hopeful of recovering some or all of this reserve amount in future periods 
audits by the dcaa have been completed on our contracts and subcontracts through the year ended september  increases in our contract services revenue from performance on contract work relate to a million increase due to an increase in work scope  the utilization of significant equipment in the performance of the work scope  and level of effort on existing contract work with the united states air force 
during fiscal year  we received a written acknowledgement from a customer that they will seek additional funding for amounts that have exceeded the contract funding on a large united states air force contract 
this expected increase in funding plus increases in work scope resulted in an increase in contract services revenue of million on this contract 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in contract services revenue of million relating to several civilian programs that have been completed or that are almost complete and a decrease of million relating to a sub contract with the united states air force that is almost complete 
revenue from software maintenance revenue increased by million 
commercial systems revenue was million in fiscal year  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal year in fiscal year  our commercial systems segment represented of total revenue  compared to in fiscal year the increase was attributable to a million increase from software maintenance revenue and a million increase in contract services revenue 
revenue from software maintenance agreements increased million from our command control division and million from our integral systems europe sas subsidiary 
contract services revenue increased as a result of three new contracts and increases in level of efforts on several contracts from our command and control division  which resulted in a million increase 
this increase was offset by decreases of million in our command and control division relating to contract services work that was completed or had a decreased level of effort in fiscal year and by million relating to two contracts with a customer that filed for bankruptcy 
because of our concern over collection from this customer  we recognized minimal revenue with respect to these two contracts during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year relating to maintenance services already paid for by the customer 
contract service revenue decreased by million from integral systems europe sas due to several contracts for which we have deferred the recognition of revenue until the post contract support service begins 
in addition  contract services revenue from newpoint decreased million due to a lower volume of product shipments 
space communications systems revenue was million in fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal year in fiscal year  our space communications systems segment represented of total revenue  compared to in fiscal year the decrease was attributable to a million decrease in contract services revenue  offset by a million increase from product revenue and a million increase from software maintenance revenue 
contract services revenue decreased by million from our 
table of contents rt logic operation due to the near completion of three large contracts that had contributed a significant amount of revenue during fiscal year in addition  contract services revenue decreased million from sat because approximately ten contracts had work scope in fiscal year  but were completed in fiscal year  and no equivalent contracts were awarded during fiscal year product revenue increased million from rt logic due to seven large contracts completed in fiscal year and from sat due to an increase in volume of product shipments  offset by a decrease of million from lumistar due to a decline in the commercial aircraft industry market as a result of the economy 
revenue from software maintenance agreements increased million  primarily due to a million increase from rt logic and million from sat 
gross profit our gross profit can vary significantly depending on the type of product or service provided 
generally  license and maintenance revenue related to the sale of our commercial off the shelf software products have the highest gross margins due to minimal incremental costs to produce them 
by contrast  gross margin for equipment and subcontractor costs are typically lower 
engineering service gross margin is typically in the range or higher 
gross profit was million in fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit in fiscal year was attributable to our government systems and space communications systems segments 
gross margin for fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year the decrease in gross margin in fiscal year was primarily attributable to government systems and commercial systems segments 
government systems gross profit was million in fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal year gross profit from contract services decreased by million  which was offset by an increase in gross profit of million from software maintenance 
contract services gross profit decreased million relating to the establishment of a revenue reserve  as discussed in revenue  million relating to five civilian programs that are almost complete and million from the near completion of work scope on a sub contract with the united states air force 
in addition  million in higher facility expense was incurred in fiscal year due to a loss recognized relating to our lanham facilities and the new corporate headquarters see operating expense for further details 
offsetting these decreases is an increase in gross profit of million relating to increases in work scope and level of effort on existing contract work with the united states air force and an increase of million relating to the large united states air force contract noted above  for which an increase in revenue was realized relating to an increase in work scope and an increase in the funding amount on this contract for certain work 
gross margin was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the revenue reserve and a shift to lower margin work scope relating to a contract with the united states air force 
commercial systems gross profit decreased slightly by million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit decreased by million from contract services  which was offset by an increase from software maintenance of million 
gross profit decreased million in our command and control division relating to contract services work that was completed or had decreased level of effort in fiscal year and due to two contracts with a customer in our command and control division that filed for bankruptcy 
because of our concern over collection from this customer  minimal revenue was recognized with respect to those contracts during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal year and an allowance for bad debt of million was established during fiscal year in addition  million in higher facility expense was incurred by the command and control division in fiscal year due to a loss recognized relating to vacating our lanham facilities upon our move to our new corporate headquarters see operating expense for further details 
gross profit from contract services decreased million from our integral systems europe sas subsidiary and our million from our newpoint subsidiary due to decrease in revenue 
offsetting these decreases was an increase in gross profit of million from contract services attributable to three new contracts and increases in level of efforts on several contracts from our command and control division  as mentioned above 
gross margin was in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to the bad debt reserve recognized relating to a customer that filed for bankruptcy

during fiscal year  the timing of receipt of funding increases on our existing contracts and subcontracts with the us government was delayed in comparison to historical timeframes 
furthermore  the award of new contracts and subcontracts with the us government has not occurred within the timeframes initially anticipated 
as a result of these delays  and the substantial completion of work on several existing contracts  our backlog has declined since the end of fiscal year 
table of contents fiscal year results are anticipated to be significantly improved over fiscal year due to an increase in revenue from higher gross margin product sales  new or expanded contract awards that were awarded at the end of fiscal year  including the extension of the period of performance on several of our critical government contracts into fiscal year  and lower selling  general and administrative sg a expense as a percent of sales 
we estimate annual revenue will increase between and percent above fiscal year revenue and our earnings are expected to benefit from ongoing efforts to trim operating expenses and the absence of a number of non recurring and one time expenses recorded in fiscal year in the first quarter of fiscal year  we initiated plans to launch a new line of business to offer global satellite communications satcom network operations management services to address the growing needs of satellite operators  resellers  users  and regulators of satellite and satellite interfaced networks worldwide
