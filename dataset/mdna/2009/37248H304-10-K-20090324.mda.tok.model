item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
it contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  economic and competitive conditions  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  potential failure to achieve production from development drilling projects  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors and cautionary notes regarding forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict and which expressly qualify all subsequent oral and written forward looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
we do not have any intention or obligation to update forward looking statements included in this report after the date of this report  except as required by law 
overview we are an oil and gas company in the business of exploring and developing oil and natural gas reserves on a worldwide basis 
since inception  we have conducted leasehold acquisition  exploration and drilling activities on our north american  australian and indonesian prospects 
these projects currently encompass approximately  gross  net acres  consisting of mineral leases  production sharing contracts and exploration permits that give us the right to explore for  develop and produce oil and natural gas 
most of these properties are in the exploration  appraisal or development drilling phase and have not begun to produce revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas 
excluding minor interest and dividend income  our only significant cash inflows until were the recovery of capital invested in projects through sale or other divestiture of interests in oil and gas prospects to industry partners 
since  substantially all of our revenue has been generated from natural gas sales derived from the magness  the fannin  and the mitchell wells in the madisonville field in east texas under spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
natural gas sales from the madisonville field are expected to account for substantially all of our revenues for we expect the majority of our capital expenditures in will be for the madisonville project 
for the years ended december  consolidated statement of operations revenues lease operating expense general and administrative net profits expense impairment expense depreciation and depletion expense loss from operations net loss net loss attributable to common shareholders revenue and operating trends in as discussed in the properties texas madisonville project section of this annual report  in order to produce the gas reserves from the rodessa formation  we developed an onsite plan to treat and remove impurities from the madisonville project natural gas in order to meet pipeline quality specifications 
in  a third party completed the construction and installation of a natural gas treatment plant with a designed capacity of million cubic feet of gas per day mmcf d and associated pipeline and gathering facilities 
in we secured a commitment from mgp to install and make operational additional treating facilities capable of treating mmcf d  which combined with the capacity of the current in service treating facilities will represent a total designed treating capacity of mmcf d for the madisonville treatment plant 
in early november  mgp began testing the additional treatment facilities by accepting mmcf d at the inlet 
subsequently in december  mgp temporarily suspended the operations of the additional treatment facilities in order to make modifications to more effectively deal with the presence of diamondoids in the gas stream produced from the rodessa formation 

table of contents during  mgp analyzed various options for removing the diamondoids  however  they did not complete the necessary plant system modifications 
on december   we purchased the gas treatment plant and related gathering pipeline from mgp in exchange for assumption of secured debt  payment of certain outstanding payables of mgp and shares of geopetro s common stock 
the effective date of the acquisition was december  and the new owner of the plant is geopetro s wholly owned  indirect subsidiary  madisonville midstream llc mm 
we expect to complete installation of the system modifications required in the new plant in in the meantime  the existing  in service portion of the plant continues to operate with a capacity of approximately mmcf d of inlet gas 
while there can be no assurance  with the recent acquisition of the gas treatment plant  our goal is to make the necessary upgrades to the plant and increase the production rates from our wells which may result in higher net production and increased revenue during as compared to and prior periods 
to accomplish the plant upgrades  we will need to raise capital in due to the tight credit markets and recent down turn in the stock market  funds may not be available  or may not be available on favorable terms 
industry overview for the year ended december  during we realized higher natural gas prices at the beginning of the year  then weaker prices by the end of the year 
the houston ship channel price  the index price prevailing in the locale of our madisonville project in madison county  texas  as quoted in gas daily as of december   was per mcf versus per mcf as of december  natural gas prices have been very volatile during due to supply concerns earlier in the year  and more recently due to recession concerns arising from the current global financial crisis 
company overview in our net loss after taxes for the year ended december  was  from our inception  through mid  we only received nominal revenues from our oil and natural gas activities  while incurring substantial acquisition and exploration costs and overhead expenses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit through december  of  commencing in may  we placed our madisonville project into production 
substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales for the year ended december  were derived from our madisonville project  from three producing wells  the umc ruby magness well the magness well  the angela farris fannin well the fannin well  and the mitchell well the mitchell well 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  and during the twelve months ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  and our net production was  mcf of natural gas at an average price of per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  and our net production was  mcf at an average price of per mcf 
revenues decreased in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the prior year period due to lower production volumes 
the lower production volumes for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period of was due to i disruption due to hurricane ike in  ii higher shrinkage rates in the plant  and iii restricted production rates due to high inlet pressures into the plant 
average natural gas prices were approximately higher for the twelve months ended december  versus the same period in during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
the average lifting cost per mcf in was higher due to a major workover performed on the magness well during and lower net production 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred net profits interest expense of  associated with the magness  the fannin  and the mitchell wells as compared to  during the twelve months ended december  the decrease resulted from lower gas income in the twelve months ended december  versus the net profit interest is of the net operating profit from our magness  fannin  and mitchell wells 
general and administrative g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this represents a  or decrease over the prior year period

table of contents for the year ended december   impairment expense was  versus  for the same period of the and impairment write downs were due to dry holes drilled on our canadian oil and gas properties  which resulted in ceiling test write downs 
depreciation and depletion expense for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  in the same period of  which amounts primarily represent depletion of the oil and gas properties for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower net production in the twelve months period of as previously discussed 
loss from operations totaled  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to loss from operations of  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in the loss from operations was due primarily to lower impairment  depreciation and depletion expenses 
other income for the twelve months ended december  and consisted of interest income in the amount of  and  respectively 
the higher interest income in was due primarily to interest received on a note receivable  which was repaid on june  during the twelve months ended december  and  we incurred interest expense of  and  respectively 
we incurred new debt in late december associated with the plant acquisition and working capital requirements 
prior year loans were repaid in full in october net loss before taxes for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in net loss during the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to lower impairment  depletion and depreciation expenses 
income tax expense for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to income tax refund of  in the same period of the increased income tax expense was due to texas margin taxes in while the income tax benefit in was due to a refund of prior year alternative minimum tax paid 
industry overview for the year ended december  the twelve months ended december  saw strengthening natural gas prices 
the houston ship channel price  the index price prevailing in the locale of our madisonville project in madison county  texas  as quoted in gas daily as of december   was per mcf versus per mcf as of december  natural gas prices improved during the year due to higher demand induced by cold temperatures experienced in many parts of the united states  among other factors 
company overview in our net loss after taxes for the year ended december  was  from our inception  through mid  we only received nominal revenues from our oil and natural gas activities  while incurring substantial acquisition and exploration costs and overhead expenses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit through december  of  commencing in may  we placed our madisonville project into production

during the twelve months ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  our net production for the twelve months ended december  was  mcf at an average price of per mcf 
revenues increased in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the prior year period due to higher gas prices but lower production volumes 
prices were approximately higher for the twelve months ended december  versus the same period in during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease 
table of contents operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
the average lifting cost per mcf in was lower due to higher production volume in during the twelve months ended december   we incurred net profits interest expense of  associated with the magness  the fannin  and the mitchell wells as compared to  during the twelve months ended december  the increase resulted from higher gas prices in the twelve months ended december  versus the net profit interest is of the net operating profit from our magness  fannin  and mitchell wells 
general and administrative g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this represents a  increase over the prior year period due primarily to us and canada public company filing fees  costs associated with our sec registration statement  and ongoing filing requirements 
the  increase over the prior year period due to primarily to  in filing fees related to our sec registration   public company filing fees in us and canada  ongoing filing requirements and costs associated with sec compliance 
for the year ended december   impairment expense was incurred in amount of  as compared to  in the same period of the and impairment write downs were due to dry holes drilled on our canadian oil and gas properties  which resulted in ceiling test write downs 
depreciation and depletion expense for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  in the same period of  which amounts primarily represent amortization of the oil and gas properties for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower net production in the twelve months period of and an increase in the amount of capitalized cost in the us oil and gas properties 
loss from operations totaled  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in the loss from operations was due primarily to higher g a cost and impairment expense associated with the canadian oil and gas properties in the twelve months ended december  versus other income for the twelve months ended december  and consisted of interest income in the amount of  and  respectively 
the reason for the decreased interest income was lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during the period as compared to period

the interest expense comparisons between the year ended and were relatively consistent 
net loss before taxes for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in net loss during the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to higher g a cost and canadian impairment write off in the twelve months ended december  versus income tax refund for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to income tax expense of  in the same period of income tax benefit in was due to a refund of prior year alternative minimum tax paid offset by a current year state tax payable 
recent developments on december   we purchased the gas treatment plant and related gathering pipeline from mgp in exchange for assumption of secured debt  payment of certain outstanding payables of mgp and shares of geopetro s common stock 
the effective date of the acquisition was december  and the new owner of the plant is geopetro s wholly owned  indirect subsidiary  madisonville midstream llc mm 
on july   we entered into a third amendment with pioneer oil company pioneer 
per the terms of the amendment  the company paid pioneer the sum of  on august   which represents the second and final payment for leases comprising  acres onshore in cook inlet  alaska 
the amendment further provided that the work program requiring million in expenditures by geopetro has been eliminated in its entirety 
on october   we amended the lease for our principal executive office located at one maritime plaza  suite  san francisco  ca  to extend the term of the sublease for an additional one year and two months and the new expiration day is april  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our cash balance at december  was  compared to a cash balance of  at december  the change in our cash balance is summarized as follows cash balance at december  sources of cash cash provided by operating activities cash provided by financing activities total sources of cash including cash on hand uses of cash cash used in investing activities oil and natural gas property expenditures gas treatment plant furniture  fixtures and equipment total uses of cash cash balance at december  we had a working capital deficit of  versus a working capital surplus of  at december  and december   respectively 
our working capital decreased during year ended december  due primarily to the acquisition of the mgp natural gas treatment plant  our participation in the drilling of a well in south texas  and the final payment to pioneer to secure the leases in cook inlet  alaska 
we have historically financed our business activities through december  principally through issuances of common shares  promissory notes and common share purchase warrants in private placements and an initial public offering 
these financings are summarized as follows years ended december  december  december  proceeds from sale of common shares and warrant exercises  net payment on preferred dividends repayments of promissory notes proceeds from promissory notes payment of loan fee repayment of related party note deferred offering costs net option exercise net cash provided by financing activities the net proceeds of our equity and note financings have been primarily invested in oil and natural gas properties totaling   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on december   we acquired the gas treatment plant from mgp for  in combination of cash  debt and common stock 
on october   we repaid  plus accrued interest of  on the short term notes we borrowed during and on august  we completed a private placement consisting of  units of the company at a subscription price of per unit for total proceeds of  each unit consisted of one share of common stock of the company and three tenths common share purchase warrant of the company 
each one whole warrant entitles the holder to acquire one share of common stock at a price of per share for a period of five years from the closing date 
the units were purchased by a group of private investors 
the proceeds of the sale of common shares will be used to fund the company s exploration and development program and for general working capital purposes 
on december   the company assumed  of madisonville gas processing lp s mgp bank debt related to the company s acquisition of the madisonville gas treatment plant the plant via a i million cash payment applied directly towards debt principal reduction  and ii a refinancing by geopetro of the  remaining balance in 
table of contents the form of a year amended and restated term loan agreement with the lender  bank oklahoma bok 
the terms of the three year loan provide for minimum quarterly principal payments of  and interest payable quarterly in arrears at prime plus or  libor plus  at the option of the company 
additional principal will be payable upon geopetro meeting certain net operating cash flow thresholds during the three year term of the loan 
the loan is secured by a first lien on the madisonville midstream plant and all of the company s proved natural gas reserves located at the madisonville project 
in addition  geopetro has agreed to a pay  at the time the loan is repaid in full  a loan origination fee of i  for any period during the three year term during which the loan principal remains outstanding 
there is no prepayment penalty 
the amended and restated term loan agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants including restrictions on incurring additional debt and requiring that the company maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least  at december  the company was in compliance with all loan covenants 
on december   we issued million shares of common stock pursuant to an asset purchase agreement related to the acquisition of the madisonville midstream gas treatment plant and related gas gathering pipelines and related facilities from madisonville gas processing  lp 
during december  geopetro raised  by issuing promissory notes to accredited investors  each having the following terms i annual simple interest payable quarterly in arrears  ii principal and any unpaid outstanding interest shall be payable at the end of three years  iii subordinated to the bok loan and iv be unsecured 
each note purchaser also received warrants to purchase one share of geopetro common stock for per share  exercisable for three years 
one warrant was received for each in face amount of notes purchased a total of  warrants exercisable to purchase  shares of common stock 
geopetro also reissued  warrants at per share to be exercised for three years 
our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and growth strategy requirements for the foreseeable future 
see outlook for for a description of our expected capital expenditures for if we are unable to generate revenues necessary to finance our operations over the long term  we may have to seek additional capital through the sale of our equity or borrowing 
as noted in recent developments  we periodically borrow funds pursuant to promissory notes to finance our activities 
as discussed in the outlook for  we are forecasting capital expenditures of million during we will need to obtain adequate sources of cash to fund our anticipated capital expenditures through the end of and to follow through with plans for continued investments in oil and gas properties 
our success  in part  depends on our ability to generate additional financing and farmout certain of our projects 
additionally  as a result of the economic downturn  the company may have difficulty raising sufficient funds to meet our projected funding requirements 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business 
since our inception  we have participated as a working interest owner in the acquisition of undeveloped leases  seismic options  lease options and foreign concessions and have participated in seismic surveys and the drilling of test wells on our undeveloped properties 
further leasehold acquisitions  drilling and seismic operations are planned for and future periods 
in addition  exploratory and development drilling is scheduled during and future periods on our undeveloped properties 
it is anticipated that these exploration activities together with others that may be entered into will impose financial requirements which will exceed our existing working capital 
we may raise additional equity and or debt capital  and we may farm out certain of our projects to finance our continued participation in planned activities 
however  if additional financing is not available  we may be compelled to reduce the scope of our business activities 
if we are unable to fund planned expenditures  it may be necessary to farmout our interest in proposed wells  sell a portion of our interest in prospects and use the sale proceeds to fund our participation for a lesser interest  reduce general and administrative expenses  forfeit our interest in wells that are proposed to be drilled 

table of contents contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is provided in the following table payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations promissory notes bank loan total effective march   geopetro is committed under an office sublease which provides for a sixty month term 
the sublease is cancelable by either party after thirty six months 
on october   we amended to extend the term of the sublease for an additional one year and two months and the new expiration date is april during december  geopetro raised  by issuing promissory notes with terms of three years at annual interest payable quarterly in arrears 
on december   geopetro financed  in the form of a year amended and restated term loan agreement with bank of oklahoma 
the terms of the three year loan provide for minimum quarterly principal payments of  and interest payable quarterly in arrears at prime plus or  libor plus at the option of the company 
this table does not include the liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties 
nor does this table include contractual obligation under certain employment agreements 
see note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other than the above commitments  the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary 
we have no other material long term commitments associated with our capital expenditure plans or operating agreements 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on the success we experience on planned exploratory and appraisal drilling activities  natural gas and oil price conditions and other related economic and political factors 
accordingly  we have not yet prepared an estimate of capital expenditures for periods beyond income taxes as of december   geopetro had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in if the company were to experience a change in ownership under section  the company may be limited in its ability to fully utilize its net operating losses 
however  in accordance with sfas r  a deferred tax asset has not been recognized for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that is attributable to excess tax deductions associated with the exercise of stock options in which do not reduce income taxes payable 
accordingly   of geopetro s federal nol has not been benefited for financial statement purposes as it relates to excess tax deductions that have not reduced income taxes payable 
the benefit of these excess tax deductions will not be recognized for financial statement purposes until the related deductions reduce income taxes payable 
the company also has  of california net operating losses and  of alaska net operating losses which begin to expire in and  respectively 
in accordance with sfas r  a portion of the state nols has similarly not been benefited for financial statement purposes as it relates to excess tax deductions which have not resulted in the reduction of income taxes payable 
the benefit of such excess tax deductions will not be recognized for financial statement purposes until the related deductions reduce state income taxes payable 
in addition  the company has  of carryforward credits in texas  a portion of which may be utilized each year against texas margin tax liability through 
table of contents a significant change in our ownership may limit our ability to use these nol carryforwards 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that the tax benefit of such net operating loss be recorded as an asset 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately  million related to the nol and other temporary differences 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance of  million at december  due to uncertainties surrounding the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  the detail of which is included in note to the financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
financial instruments we currently have no natural gas price financial instruments or hedges in place 
similarly  we have no financial derivatives 
our natural gas marketing contracts use spot market prices 
given the uncertainty of the timing and volumes of our natural gas production this year  we do not currently plan to enter into any long term fixed price natural gas contracts  swap or hedge positions  other gas financial instruments or financial derivatives in 
table of contents outlook for capital depending on capital availability  we are forecasting capital spending of up to approximately million during the year  allocated as follows madisonville project  madison county  texas approximately million may be expended in the madisonville field area as follows million for capital maintenance and repair on new gas treatment plant  million toward the fracture stimulation and hook up costs of the wilson well   for the mitchell well workover   for lowering the line pressure  and  for lease acquisitions 
cook inlet  alaska approximately million to be utilized for land delay rentals  geologic and geophysical costs  wellsite preparation  permitting  and logistics 
california and indonesia approximately million to be utilized for land  geologic and geophysical costs 
we may  in our discretion  decide to allocate resources towards other projects in addition to or in lieu of  those listed above should other opportunities arise and as circumstances warrant 
we currently do not have sufficient working capital to fund all of the capital expenditures listed above 
the madisonville project forecasted capital expenditures will play an important part in the company achieving our cash flow projections 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we expect commodity prices to be volatile  reflecting the current supply and demand fundamentals for north american natural gas and world crude oil 
political and economic events around the world  which are difficult to predict  will continue to influence both oil and gas prices 
significant price changes for oil and gas often lead to changes in the levels of drilling activity which in turn lead to changes in costs to explore  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
significant change in costs could affect the returns on our capital expenditures 
higher crude prices could also help keep natural gas prices high by keeping alternative fuels  such as heating oil and residual fuel  expensive 
impact of inflation changing prices as the following table illustrates  average sales prices of natural gas have changed in the past three years 
this has led to changes in revenues and earnings from operations for the year ended december  average sales prices per mcf net production volume mcf revenues earnings loss from operation includes  impairment expense includes  impairment expense includes  impairment expense we are highly dependent upon natural gas pricing 
a material decrease in current and projected natural gas prices could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms 
likewise  a material decrease in current and projected natural gas prices could also impact our revenues and cash flows 
this could impact our ability to fund future activities 
changing prices have had a significant impact on costs of drilling and completing wells  particularly in the madisonville field area where we are currently the most active 
the estimated cost of drilling and completing a rodessa formation well at approximately  feet of depth has increased from million in to million in due to higher costs associated with tubular goods  well equipment  and day rates for drilling contracts  among other factors 
these higher costs have impacted and will continue to impact our income from operations in the form of higher depletion expense 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the most critical accounting policies that may have an impact on our financial results relate to the accounting for oil and gas properties 
amortization  abandonment costs and full cost ceiling limitation write downs are all based on numerous estimates  many of which are beyond management s control 
reserves valuation is central to much of the accounting for an oil and gas company as described below 
significant accounting policies are contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a summary of unaudited supplementary oil and gas reserve information is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discusses the accounting estimates that are critical in determining the reported financial results oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as prescribed by us gaap and  accordingly  capitalize all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development drilling of proved oil and gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and lease rentals 
all general corporate costs are expensed as incurred 
in general  sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded 
amortization of evaluated oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on all proved reserves on a country by country basis 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregate basis 
the net capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties full cost ceiling limitation are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
reserves we engage independent petroleum engineering consultants to evaluate our reserves 
reserves  future production profiles  and net revenues are estimated by independent professional reservoir engineering firms 
while we engage qualified reservoir engineering firms  their estimates are inherently uncertain  involve numerous assumptions that may not be realized  and predict asset values that may not be indicative of the true market value of the assets evaluated 
as a result of the inherent uncertainties and changing technical and economic assumptions  reserve estimates are subject to revisions that can materially impact our results 
asset retirement obligation we provide for the estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of tangible long lived assets using a fair value method  which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire such assets 
the reported liability is a discounted amount 
the amount of the liability is affected by factors such as the number of wells  the timing of the expected expenditures and the discount factor 
these estimates will change and the revisions could impact the amortization rates 
stock based compensation the company has a stock based compensation plan that allows employees to purchase common shares of the company 
option exercise prices approximate the market price for the common shares on the date the options were issued 
options granted under the plan are generally fully exercisable after five years and expire five to ten years after the grant date 
we measure and record stock based awards to directors  employees and consultants based on the grant date fair value  determined using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions for risk free interest rates  expected dividend yield  expected life of the option  and the expected volatility 
we record the compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period defined in the award 
the company recorded   and  of stock based employee compensation for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes  without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas no 
 entities that elect the fair value option by instrument will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option election is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entity s election on its earnings  but does not eliminate disclosure requirements of other accounting standards 
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value must be displayed on the face of the balance sheet 
we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r  which among other things  establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
this standard will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
it also establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary and requires expanded disclosures 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends and expands the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
with the intent to provide users of financial statement with an enhanced understanding of i how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  ii how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under fasb statement no 
and its related interpretations  and iii how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect and entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for years and interim periods beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant effect on our reported financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf no 

eitf no 
clarifies the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  which would qualify as a scope exception under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
eitf no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption for an existing instrument is not permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of eitf no 
but does not expect adoption to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements since we have not and do not intend to issue equity instruments containing embedded derivatives 
modernization of oil gas reporting requirements announced by the sec in december  the sec issued the final rule on the modernization of oil and gas reporting 
this sec ruling revises its oil and gas reserves reporting requirements effective for fiscal years ending on or after december   with early adoption prohibited

these changes include modifying prices used to estimate reserves for sec disclosure purposes to a month average price instead of a single day  period end price 
requiring certain additional disclosures around proved undeveloped reserves  internal controls used to ensure objectivity of the estimation process  and qualifications of those preparing and or auditing the reserves 
expanding the definition of oil and gas reserves and providing clarification of certain concepts and technologies used in the reserve estimation process 
allowing optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves and permitting optional disclosure of price sensitivity analysis 
historically  the reserves calculated based on the sec s reporting requirements were also used to calculate depletion on our producing properties  as required by sfas  disclosures about oil and gas producing activities sfas 
however  the change in the sec reporting requirements has not yet been adopted by the fasb 
the sec has announced its intent to discuss potential amendments to sfas with the fasb so that the reserves disclosed remain consistent with the reserves used to calculate depletion on our producing properties 
any such change would impact our future financial results 
the sec has indicated that it may delay the effective date of the revised reporting requirements if the fasb does not make conforming amendments by december  risks and uncertainties there are a number of risks that face participants in the us  canadian and international oil and natural gas industry  including a number of risks that face us in particular

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuating prices of crude oil  natural gas and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas in the east texas region 
prices received for natural gas are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
for the year ended december   a change in the prices received for natural gas production would have had an approximate  impact on our revenues 
currency translation risk 
because our revenues and expenses are primarily in us dollars  we have little exposure to currency translation risk  and  therefore  we have no plans in the foreseeable future to implement hedges or financial instruments to manage international currency changes 
hedging 
we did not enter into any hedging transactions during the years ended december  and
