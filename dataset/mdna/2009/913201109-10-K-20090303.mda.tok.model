table of contents community bank lending commercial real estate lending 
united western bank originates commercial real estate loans cre that are generally secured by one or more of the following kinds of properties multifamily residential property  owner and non owner occupied commercial  retail and industrial income property  and single tenant property 
the owner occupied component of these loans also includes sba loans and a loans 
the bank s cre loans are generally made at variable rates that change daily or quarterly based on changes in the prime rate or libor  although some are made at fixed rates 
terms of up to years are offered primarily on sba loans  but most loans are structured with a balloon payment at the end of approximately five years or amortize over a period of up to ten years 
in deciding whether to make a commercial real estate loan  the bank considers  among other things  the experience and qualifications of the borrower as well as the value and anticipated cash flow of the underlying property due from its tenant mix 
among the additional underwriting factors considered are net operating income of the property before debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio the ratio of the property s free cash flow to debt service requirements  the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value and cost  and the recourse to the overall creditworthiness of the prospective borrower and guarantor 
the bank s commercial real estate loans typically range in size from  to million 
the bank s legal lending limit is approximately million 
loans greater than million  are not often granted and require full bank board of director approval 
commercial real estate lending typically involves higher principal amounts than the other types of loans we make 
moreover  the repayment of the loans generally is dependent  in large part  from the cash flow generated from the successful operations of the property collateralizing the loan or the business conducted on the owner occupied property collateralizing the obligation 
secondary sources of repayment are usually the sale or refinance of the subject property with credit enhancement also required in the form of personal guarantees from the majority owners of the subject collateral 
as a result  these loans may be more susceptible and adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy in general 
for example  if the cash flow from a borrower s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
in addition  because many commercial real estate loans have balloon payments due at maturity instead of being fully amortized over the term of a loan a borrower s ability to repay may depend on being able either to refinance the loan or sell the underlying property 
residential and commercial construction and development lending 
united western bank provides construction and development loans c d for the development of land and vertical construction of one to four family  multifamily and condominium residences 
loans are also provided for the development of land and vertical construction for retail  office  and other commercial purposes 
underwriting guidelines for c d facilities generally require presale or preleasing requirements in addition to personal guarantees of the project s owners or development partners 
land development and construction loans share many of the same risks as discussed above with commercial real estate loans with respect to sale or refinance repayment alternatives 
in addition  c d lending also involves construction related risks because funds are advanced incrementally based on a preapproved construction budget or a percent complete calculation 
the loan is secured by the to be completed project  which is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it can be difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value and loan to cost ratios 
if the appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated  the bank may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may require collateral re margin requirement to protect against a potential loss 
accordingly  the bank generally requires a personal guaranty on all residential and commercial construction and development lending 
commercial and industrial lending 
united western bank makes commercial and industrial loans c i to small and middle market businesses 
c i borrowers tend to be privately owned operating companies and are generally service providers  distributors  and manufacturers 
the loan products offered are primarily working capital and term loans secured with real estate facilities and equipment and lines of credit that help customers finance trading assets including accounts receivable and inventory 
these loans are typically guaranteed by the owners of the business and subject to underwriting guidelines that include borrowing base parameters and compliance with financial covenants 
the collateral securing c i loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise  and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business and the volatility of the underlying cash flow 
in addition  in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent upon the ability of the borrower to collect the amounts due from its customers 
accordingly  the bank makes commercial loans primarily based on the identified cash flow and capital adequacy of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
commercial loans are made at variable rates that fluctuate with the prime rate 
prospectively  the bank anticipates making c i loans to small to mid sized energy companies  including coal  oil  gas  and green oriented businesses like solar and wind power 
in addition  the bank has set up a captive leasing division that originates third party leases as a cross sell opportunity to c i and sba relationship clients 

table of contents small business administration lending 
the bank s sba division is a participant in the national preferred lenders program plp of the united states small business administration 
with national plp status  the bank is able to participate in the plp nationally  which encompasses districts spanning states 
the bank originates sba loans and a loans 
under the sba program  the bank provides  in conjunction with a certified development company cdc  a conventional loan collateralized by a first lien on commercial real estate or equipment 
the sba program provides for an sba guarantee of debentures issued for up to a maximum of of the eligible project costs  which is subordinated to the primary mortgage originated by the bank 
under the sba s a program  loans in excess of  and up to  are guaranteed by the sba 
generally  this guarantee may become invalid only if the loan does not meet the sba underwriting  documentation  and servicing guidelines 
loans under  are guaranteed by the sba 
sba a loans  collateralized by real estate  have terms of up to years  while loans collateralized by equipment and working capital have terms of up to ten years and seven years  respectively 
a minimum down payment of is required on most loans  but a larger down payment may be required when the real estate collateral consists of a special purpose or single use property  such as a motel or service station 
new markets tax credits lending 
new markets tax credits nmtc are awarded under a program administered by the community development financial institutions fund  a division of the united states department of treasury 
the nmtc program permits taxpayers investors to claim a credit against federal income taxes for each qualified equity investment qei made to a designated community development entity 
the investor receives a tax credit over a seven year period  in the amount of in years one through three  and in years four through seven 
in  the bank acquired million tax credits through a million qualifying equity investment it made to its owned subsidiary  community development funding i  llc cdf i 
cdf i used the investment proceeds to originate loans eligible under the nmtc program through the bank 
on december   the bank invested million in charter facilities funding iv  llc  another owned subsidiary of the bank cff iv and received tax credits of million 
cff iv used the investment proceeds to originate loans eligible under the nmtc program through the bank 
on december   the bank made an additional investment of million to cff iv  making the bank eligible for an additional million of tax credits 
the additional investment proceeds are being used by cff iv to make eligible nmtc loans through the bank 
at december   the bank has million of nmtc loans outstanding 
nmtc loans are generally commercial real estate loans in designated community development areas low income areas or economic enterprise zones made in accordance with the bank s and community development entities lending policies and in accordance with the rules of the new markets tax credits program 
generally these loans are fixed rate and there is a concession in the rate as compared to the remainder of the bank s community bank loan portfolio 
the loans also have longer terms  often to years  with an initial seven years of interest only payments followed by amortization to maturity 
these loans are included with commercial real estate loans in our tables and financial statements and the underlying collateral is commercial property 
consumer lending 
the bank s consumer lending portfolio is primarily focused on individual wealth management and private bank investment and lending products as opposed to blanket underwriting and funding objectives to compete with the mass retail marketplace 
the bank offers home equity lines of credit and to a limited extent  home equity term loans  credit card  auto  and unsecured consumer loans 
home equity lines of credit may be extended up to of the appraised value of the property  less existing liens  generally at variable interest rates based on prime  the federal reserve board target rate for overnight borrowings  or libor 
in addition  most consumer loans are structured with floor pricing and incorporate underwriting guidelines that include minimum credit score requirements and aggregate liquidity and debt service guidelines 
the bank uses the same underwriting standards for home equity lines of credit as it uses for residential real estate loans 
consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields as compared to residential real estate loans  but generally carry higher risks of default 
consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus  are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
wholesale lending single family residence lending 
united western bank owns approximately million of wholesale single family residential whole loans 
while the overwhelming majority of these loans were purchased by the bank in the secondary market  a small portion were originated by matrix financial services prior to february  and approximately five percent of these loans represent loans purchased from matrix financial services servicing portfolio 

table of contents prior to our change in business strategy  the bank regularly reviewed residential loan portfolios for prospective acquisition  however  the bank has not purchased any such loan portfolios since september these portfolios were typically first lien priority loans secured primarily by to family residential properties 
most were adjustable rate loans 
the bank would purchase packages of residential loans from various sellers who had either originated the loans or acquired the loans from others in bulk purchases 
the bank would consider several factors prior to a purchase  including the product type  the current loan balance  the current interest rate environment  the seasoning of the mortgage loans  payment histories  geographic location of the underlying collateral  price  yield  the current liquidity of the bank and the product mix in its existing residential loan portfolio 
in addition  the various sellers were evaluated for their ability to perform under the representations and warranties that would be provided to the bank at the time of purchase 
the bank performed due diligence on each residential loan portfolio that it desired to purchase 
these underwriting procedures consisted of analyzing all or  in some instances  a representative sample of the loans in the portfolio and were typically performed by bank employees  but occasionally were outsourced to third party contractors 
the underwriter took into account many factors and statistics in analyzing the loans in the subject portfolio  including the general economic conditions in the geographic area or areas in which the underlying residential properties were located  the credit score of the borrower  the loan to value ratios and quality of the valuations on the underlying loan collateral  the payment histories of the borrowers  as well as their income and debt to income levels 
in addition  the underwriter attempted to verify that each sample loan conformed to the standards for loan documentation set by the secondary market for investment grade mortgages 
in cases where a significant portion of the sample loans contained nonconforming documentation  the bank assessed the additional risk involved in purchasing those loans 
this process helped the bank determine whether the mortgage loan portfolio met its investment criteria and  if it did  the range of pricing that was appropriate 
purchased sba guaranteed loans 
united western bank owns approximately million of guaranteed portions of sba a loans that it acquired in the secondary market 
these loans are adjustable rate and generally reset quarterly with changes in the prime rate 
the bank purchased these guaranteed portions of sba loans from various sellers  typically the originator of the loan who retained the unguaranteed portion and continues to service the loan 
historically the bank pooled these loans as permitted by the sba into sba pooled securities through the use of a fiscal and transfer agent approved by the sba 
the certificates were then sold directly to institutional investors  achieving legal isolation and thus sale treatment 
the process of securitizing sba loans into pools of sba certificates is prescribed by the sba and must be followed to maintain the sba guarantee 
other activities related to lending sales of loans 
in the normal course of business  the bank sells certain of the sba loans it originates in the secondary market 
the bank has sold residential loans outright and has sold securities backed by residential loans after securitization with a governmental sponsored agency 
in prior years the bank also sold multifamily loans 
during  the bank sold approximately million of originated sba loans 
the bank may sell sba loans from time to time to manage industry exposures  interest rate risk and for current income 
the sale of loans may generate a gain or loss for the bank 
gains or losses result primarily from two factors 
first  the bank may make a loan to a borrower at an interest rate that is higher or lower than the prevailing or the expected rate in the market resulting in a price difference when the loan is sold in the secondary market 
these price differences occur primarily as a result of competitive pricing conditions in the market place 
second  gains or losses may result from changes in interest rates that consequently change the market value of loans originated for sale 
deposits deposits 
the bank offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
the bank s core deposits consist of retail and institutional checking accounts  now accounts  money market accounts  retail savings accounts and certificates of deposit 
these deposits  along with short term and long term borrowings  and to a lesser extent brokered deposits  are used to support our asset base 
retail deposits are obtained predominantly from the geographic trade areas surrounding our community banking office locations 
institutional deposits are obtained nationally 
institutional deposits comprise approximately and over of total deposits at december  and  respectively 
management will continue to target the conversion of its institutional deposit base to a traditional community bank deposit base over time  however  in the current economic environment  management believes all deposits are valuable and that access to general liquidity will be important for all banks for at least the next two years 
given the fact that  historically  the bank s institutional deposit base has been less expensive than community bank deposits  it is likely that management will work to maintain the longstanding relationships the bank has with its institutional depositors  and to preserve the generally lower cost from these liabilities 
with the maturation of the bank s branch distribution system and operations now being conducted out of seven open locations  the bank is in a position to use its critical mass and growing reputation as a colorado banking leader to launch future deposit campaigns 
prospectively  management anticipates that attraction of retail deposits from our community banking offices will reduce the reliance on institutional deposits

risk factors  and item management s discussion and analysis liquidity bank liquidity and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition deposits for further discussion 

table of contents total deposits  including custodial escrow balances  increased million between december  and december  approximately million of this growth is from our community banking offices 
this growth includes million of certificate accounts generated from a successful third quarter marketing campaign and million obtained through the certificate accounts offered through the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program 
the bank joined the cdars network during the second quarter of the cdars program provides full fdic insurance on deposit balances greater than posted fdic limits by exchanging larger depository relationships with other cdars members 
depositors funds are broken into amounts below fdic insurance limits and placed with other banks that are members of the cdars network 
each member bank issues certificate accounts in denominations below the fdic insured limit  resulting in full fdic insurance for the entire deposit 
for regulatory reporting purposes  cdars accounts are considered brokered deposits 
however  for financial reporting purposes  as these deposits were generated by local customers through our banking offices  we consider these part of our community banking deposits 
community bank deposits represent deposits attracted by our regional banking teams 
in addition to the methods described above  the bank has a wide variety of deposit products designed to attract business clients 
our treasury advisory services team offers business clients remote deposit capture  lockbox  sweep products  and ach and wire services 
the bank is also participating in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
the fdic has created tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts  and certain holding companies  and by providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount through december  self directed trust and custody activities self directed trust and custody services 
the company s self directed trust and custody activities are provided through sterling 
trust and custodial activities were also performed at united western bank until april   when the trust department of united western bank was sold 
sterling provides administrative services for self directed individual retirement accounts  qualified business retirement plans and personal custodial accounts  as well as corporate escrow and paying agent services 
in addition  sterling offers specialized custody and clearing services to investment professionals 
these services are marketed on a nationwide basis to the financial services industry  specifically broker dealers  registered representatives  financial planners and advisors  tax professionals  insurance agents and investment product sponsors 
the advantage offered by sterling is the ability to hold a wide array of publicly traded investments  as well as nonstandard assets and private placement offerings 
at december   sterling had approximately  accounts with assets under administration of approximately billion 
as of december   approximately million of the billion represented deposits held at united western bank 
sterling does not offer financial planning or advisory services  nor does it recommend  sell or solicit any investments 
sterling acts only as a directed custodian and is not affiliated with any investment 
sterling seeks to maintain this independence in order to provide its services without any conflicting interests 
sterling does not execute any investment transaction without the direction of the account holder or the account holder s authorized representative 
brokerage services uw investment services  inc uwis is registered with finra as a fully disclosed broker dealer  headquartered in denver  colorado 
uwis previously provided brokerage services through sba pooling and structured finance transactions 
uwis  as agent for united western bank  purchased the guaranteed portion of sba a loans from bank and non bank lenders around the country 
these loans were assembled and later pooled into sba securities that were sold into the secondary market to institutional and sophisticated investors 
in addition  uwis brokered the sale of fixed income securities to institutional clients 
prospectively  uwis will provide services that complement our overall community banking business plan which services may include securities brokerage services and retirement account management and other services 
at this time  uwis is not active in providing any services to any third party clients 

table of contents mortgage servicing activities residential mortgage loan servicing 
historically  we conducted our residential mortgage loan servicing activities through matrix financial services  including the residential mortgage loan servicing that matrix financial services provided as subservicer for united western bank s servicing portfolio 
in november  matrix financial services transferred all of its servicing functions to a third party subservicer 
the servicing transfer was done in an effort to lower the overall cost of servicing by eliminating many of the fixed costs of servicing the loans in house 
matrix financial services now pays the subservicer a fixed fee per loan that varies based on whether the loan is a fixed rate or adjustable rate  or if the loan is delinquent 
as part of the agreement  the custodial deposits are maintained at united western bank 
we have retained a small staff of six people at matrix financial services primarily to monitor the servicing activities of the subservicer 
at december   including loans owned by matrix financial services and united western bank  matrix financial services serviced approximately million of mortgage loans through the subservicer 
servicing mortgage loans involves a contractual right to receive a fee for collecting  processing and administering mortgage loan payments 
this processing involves collecting monthly mortgage payments on behalf of investors and remitting collected payments to investors on a periodic basis  reporting information to those investors on a monthly basis and maintaining custodial escrow accounts for the payment of principal and interest to investors and property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of borrowers 
these payments are held in custodial escrow accounts at united western bank 
as compensation for its mortgage servicing activities  matrix financial services receives servicing fees  plus any late charges collected from delinquent borrowers and other fees incidental to the services provided 
in the event of default by the borrower  matrix financial services receives no servicing fees until the default is cured 
at december   matrix financial services annual weighted average servicing fee was 
of the unpaid principal balance outstanding on each mortgage 
servicing is provided on mortgage loans on a recourse or nonrecourse basis 
matrix financial services policy was to accept only a limited number of servicing assets on a recourse basis 
as of december   on the basis of outstanding principal balances  approximately 
of its owned mortgage servicing contracts involved recourse servicing with credit risk exposure in the event of underlying mortgagor default to matrix financial services 
additionally  many of its nonrecourse mortgage servicing contracts require matrix financial services to advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of the mortgage loan in the event of a default by the borrower 
many owners of mortgage loans also require the servicer to advance insurance premiums and tax payments on schedule even though sufficient escrow funds may not be available 
therefore  matrix financial services must bear the funding costs associated with making such advances 
if the delinquent loan does not become current  these advances are typically recovered at the time of the foreclosure sale 
foreclosure expenses  which may include legal fees or property maintenance expenses  are generally not fully reimbursable by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae  for which agencies matrix financial services provides significant amounts of mortgage loan servicing 
as of december   matrix financial services had advanced approximately million in funds on behalf of third party investors 
matrix financial services may incur normal curtailments of certain advances on loans serviced for ginnie mae and fannie mae 
generally advances on behalf of private investors are fully collectible 
for the veteran affairs va loans sold and serviced for ginnie mae  which are sold on a nonrecourse basis  the va loan guarantees may not cover the entire principal balance and  in that case  matrix financial services is responsible for the losses that exceed the va s guarantee 
estimated losses related to foreclosure and other servicer advances are estimated and reserved for  and are included in the consolidated financial statements as a reduction of the amount of other receivables 

table of contents competition united western bank faces substantial competition from a variety of competitors in all phases of its operations  including loan and deposit account originations 
there is significant competition among commercial banks in the bank s market area 
as a result of the deregulation of the financial services industry see regulation and supervision gramm leach bliley below  the bank also competes with other providers of financial services  such as credit unions  consumer finance companies  securities firms  insurance companies  insurance agencies  commercial finance and leasing companies  full service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms 
some of the bank s competitors have greater resources and  as such  may have higher lending limits and may offer other services that are not provided by the bank 
the bank generally competes on the basis of customer service and responsiveness to customer needs  available loan and deposit products  the rates of interest charged on loans  and the rates of interest paid for deposits and other funds 
the bank does not compete by lessening its credit quality standards 
sterling trust company faces considerable competition in all of the services and products that it offers  mainly from other self directed trust companies  broker dealers and third party administrators 
sterling also faces competition from other trust companies and trust divisions of financial institutions 
sterling s niche has been  and will continue to be  providing high quality customer service and servicing nonstandard retirement products for self directed individual retirement accounts  other qualified retirement plans and escrow services for third parties 
in an effort to increase market share  sterling endeavors to provide superior service  offer technologically advanced solutions  expand its marketing efforts  provide competitive pricing and continue to diversify its product mix 
if sterling is unable to attract and retain customers in its trust operations  with the deposits those customers bring to the bank  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
to the extent that uwis reenters the brokerage services and other business lines normally associated with securities brokerage eg  retirement account management  wealth management  and other services it will face substantial competition from larger and better capitalized market participants 
our management believes that uwis will be able to compete effectively because of the trusted relationships developed with clients of sterling and united western bank  but there can be no assurance that uwis will be able to effectively compete in the provision of traditional brokerage services 
employees at december   the company had employees 
we believe that relations with our employees are good 
the company is not party to any collective bargaining agreement 
with the continued implementation of the community banking strategy  we anticipate modest increases in the number of employees at united western bank prospectively 
regulation and supervision set forth below is a brief description of various laws  regulatory authorities and associated regulations affecting our operations 
the description of laws and regulations contained in this document does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations 
on november   we applied for proceeds in an amount up to of our risk weighted assets at september  under the capital purchase program cpp initiated by the united states department of the treasury treasury pursuant to the emergency economic stabilization act of our application was endorsed to treasury by the treasury s office of thrift supervision ots  our principal regulator 
as of the date of this report  our application was still pending before treasury 
as described below  if we receive cpp proceeds we will be subject to certain additional regulatory burdens  including the treasury s unilateral right to amend our agreement with treasury pertaining to treasury s cpp investment in us  entering into a source of strength agreement with the ots and limitations on our ability to compensate certain of our senior officers 

table of contents emergency economic stabilization act of in response to recent unprecedented market turmoil  the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was enacted on october  the eesa authorizes the treasury to provide up to billion in funding for the financial services industry 
pursuant to the eesa  the treasury was initially authorized to use billion for the troubled asset relief program tarp 
of this amount  treasury allocated billion to the tarp capital purchase program see description below 
on january   the second billion of tarp monies was released to the treasury 
the secretary of the treasury s authority under tarp expires on december  unless the secretary of the treasury certifies to congress that extension is necessary provided that his authority may not be extended beyond october  pursuant to the authority granted under the eesa  the treasury created the tarp capital purchase program cpp pursuant to which the treasury will invest up to billion in senior preferred stock of us banks and savings associations or their holding companies 
qualifying financial institutions may issue senior preferred stock with a value equal to not less than of their risk weighted assets and not more than the lesser of billion or of their risk weighted assets 
the senior preferred stock will pay dividends at the rate of per annum until the fifth anniversary of the investment and thereafter at the rate of per annum 
the senior preferred stock may not be redeemed for three years except with the proceeds from an offering of common stock or preferred stock qualifying as tier capital in an amount equal to not less than of the amount of the senior preferred stock 
after three years  the senior preferred stock may be redeemed at any time in whole or in part by the financial institution 
no dividends may be paid on common stock unless dividends have been paid on the senior preferred stock 
until the third anniversary of the issuance of the senior preferred stock  the consent of the treasury will be required for any increase in the dividends on the common stock or for any stock repurchases unless the senior preferred stock has been redeemed in its entirety or the treasury has transferred the senior preferred stock to third parties 
the senior preferred stock will not have voting rights other than the right to vote as a class on the issuance of any preferred stock ranking senior to it  any change in its terms or any merger  exchange or similar transaction that would adversely affect its rights 
the senior preferred stock will also have the right to elect two directors if dividends have not been paid for six periods 
the senior preferred stock will be freely transferable and participating institutions will be required to file a shelf registration statement covering the senior preferred stock 
the issuing institution must grant the treasury piggyback registration rights 
prior to issuance  the financial institution and its senior executive officers must modify or terminate all benefit plans and arrangements to comply with eesa 
senior executives must also waive any claims against the treasury 
in connection with the issuance of the senior preferred stock  participating institutions must issue to the treasury immediately exercisable year warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the amount of the senior preferred stock 
the exercise price of the warrants will equal the market price of the common stock on the date of the investment calculated on a day trailing average 
the treasury may only exercise or transfer one half of the warrants prior to the earlier of december  or the date the issuing financial institution has received proceeds equal to the senior preferred stock investment from one or more offerings of common or preferred stock qualifying as tier capital 
the treasury will not exercise voting rights with respect to any shares of common stock acquired through exercise of the warrants 
the financial institution must file a shelf registration statement covering the warrants and underlying common stock as soon as practicable after issuance and grant piggyback registration rights 
the number of warrants will be reduced by one half if the financial institution raises capital equal to the amount of the senior preferred stock through one or more offerings of common stock or preferred stock qualifying as tier capital 
if the financial institution does not have sufficient authorized shares of common stock available to satisfy the warrants or their issuance otherwise requires shareholder approval  the financial institution must call a meeting of shareholders for that purpose as soon as practicable after the date of investment 
we have sufficient authorized  but unissued  shares of both preferred and common stock to comply with the terms and conditions of the cpp program  if we elect to participate in it 
the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced by for each six months that lapse before shareholder approval is obtained  if such approval is required  subject to a maximum reduction of 
if we decide to participate in the cpp program  no shareholder approval will be required 
if we elect to accept cpp proceeds  we will be required to execute the treasury s standard form documents evidencing the treasury s capital investment the standard forms 
the standard forms provide  in part  that the treasury may amend the terms and conditions of the standard forms at any time and for any reason 
consequently  treasury may elect to assert additional regulatory authority over any cpp participant through this provision 
we are unable to predict how  when or why treasury may exercise its retained amendment powers as contained in the standard forms 

table of contents in addition  we have been advised by the ots that we will be required to enter into a source of strength agreement with the ots prior to the time that we receive any cpp proceeds 
traditionally  savings bank holding companies have not been subject to this manner of agreement that will require us to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to united western bank 
under this agreement  we will be expected to commit financial and management resources to support united western bank  including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide it 
temporary regulations promulgated by treasury under the authority of section of eesa included certain limitations on compensation to certain named executive officers and other of our officers 
on february   section of eesa was amended in its entirety by the american recover and reinvestment act of as discussed below 
as of the date of this report  treasury had not issued any new regulations under section the eesa also temporarily increased the amount of deposit coverage for deposits at banks  thrifts and credit unions for deposits that are subject to deposit insurance provided by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic from  to  per applicable depositor 
this coverage is set to  per applicable depositor on december  unless extended by the treasury department 
on october   the fdic announced the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp 
the final rule was adopted on november  the fdic stated that its purpose is to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by a participating entity on or after october  through and including june   that is days or greater  and by providing full coverage of all transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
inclusion in the program is voluntary 
participating institutions are assessed fees based on a sliding scale  depending on the length of maturity 
shorter term debt has a lower fee structure and longer term debt has a higher fee 
the range is from basis points on debt of days or less  and a maximum of basis points for debt with maturities of one year or longer  on an annualized basis 
a basis point surcharge is added to a participating institution s current insurance assessment in order to fully cover all transaction accounts 
united western bank elected to participate in both parts of the tlgp  and we elected to participate in the senior unsecured debt portion of the program 
the fdic will only guarantee a participant s newly issued unsecured debt in a total amount not to exceed of the par or face value of such participant s senior unsecured debt outstanding as of september  and scheduled to mature on june  if there was no unsecured senior debt outstanding at september   the amount available under the program is limited to two percent of total liabilities as of september  the tlgp permits participating entities of an insured depository institution to make request to the fdic to have some debt covered by the tlgp 
 as the company did not have any unsecured senior debt outstanding as of september   we will be required to make application to the fdic for an exception to its rules under tlgp to permit us to issue any tlgp debt 
in addition  as a grandfathered unitary thrift holding company  we engage in certain limited activities that are not otherwise permitted under section k of the bank holding company act of  as amended  the bhc act  we will be required to apply for an exemption to qualify as an issuer of debt under the tlgp 
as of the date of this report  we have not made any application for either of the exemptions discussed above 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  as signed into law on february   at title vii  amends and replaces section of eesa which formed the basis of a number of the executive compensation restriction limits imposed by eesa 
as amended by the stimulus act  eesa section new section requires the secretary of the treasury to establish executive compensation and corporate governance standards covering  among other things  a restriction limiting any bonuses to certain executive officers to restricted stock of the company in amount not to exceed of total compensation for any one fiscal year  the elimination of any termination or other golden parachute payments to the covered executive officers  the imposition of clawback agreement designed to recover any bonuses paid to certain executives in the event of certain misrepresentations concerning company performance and the avoidance of unnecessary risk taking by the covered executives in the management of the company s operations 
the officers to whom the strictures of new section apply vary depending on the amount of cpp proceeds received by the company in question 
in our case  based on our current application for cpp investment  we believe that our chief executive officer  our chief financial officer and the next three most highly compensated of our officers will be covered by the strictures of new section if our application for cpp proceeds is granted  we will b subject to new section and any regulations promulgated thereunder by the secretary of the treasury

as a unitary savings and loan holding company that has been in existence prior to may   we generally are not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which we may engage  provided that the bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the home owners loan act 
to maintain its status as a qualified thrift lender  the bank must maintain a minimum percentage of its assets in qualified thrift investments unless the ots grants an exception to this requirement 
in general  qualified thrift investments include certain types of residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and certain loans to small businesses 
if we acquire control of another savings association as a separate subsidiary  we would become a multiple  rather than a unitary  savings and loan holding company 
multiple savings and loan holding companies may only engage in those activities permissible for a financial holding company under the bhc act 
generally  financial holding companies may only engage in activities such as banking  insurance and securities activities  as well as merchant banking activities under certain circumstances 
in addition  if the bank fails to maintain its status as a qualified thrift lender  within one year of its failure  we would be required to convert the bank to a commercial bank and to register as a bank holding company under the bhc act  as amended 
change in bank control act 
the change in bank control act of  as amended  provides that no person  acting directly or indirectly or through or in concert with one or more other persons  may acquire control of a savings association unless the ots has been given days prior written notice 
the home owners loan act provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association without the prior approval of the ots 
any company that acquires such control becomes a savings and loan holding company subject to registration  examination and regulation by the ots 
pursuant to federal regulations  control of a savings association which includes its holding company is conclusively deemed to have been acquired by  among other things  the acquisition of more than of any class of voting stock of the association or the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors of the association 
moreover  control is presumed to have been acquired  subject to rebuttal  upon the acquisition of more than of any class of voting stock  but less than of any class of stock of a savings association  where certain enumerated control factors are also present in the acquisition 
the ots may prohibit an acquisition of control if it would result in a monopoly or substantially lessen competition  the financial condition of the acquiring person might jeopardize the financial stability of the association  or the competence  experience or integrity of the acquiring person indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors or the public to permit the acquisition of control by such person 
gramm leach bliley 
the gramm leach bliley act of  as amended also known as the financial services modernization act gramm leach bliley eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks  securities firms  insurance companies and other financial service providers 
the law revised and expanded the bhc act to permit a bank holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities by electing to be treated by the federal reserve board as a financial holding company 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the federal reserve board  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determined to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities  or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
gramm leach bliley prohibits unitary savings and loan holding companies formed after may  from engaging in non financial activities 
since we are a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company 
gramm leach bliley has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  because banking law permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate with one another there is a continuing trend in the financial services industry toward consolidation 
as a result  gramm leach bliley could lead to an increasing amount of competition from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources

sections a and b of the federal reserve act of  as amended  and its implementing regulations govern transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates 
these provisions are made applicable to savings associations  such as united western bank  by the home owners loan act 
section a limits the extent to which the savings association or its subsidiaries may engage in certain transactions with its affiliates 
these transactions include  among other things  the making of loans or other extensions of credit to an affiliate and the purchase of assets from an affiliate 
generally  such transactions between a savings association and any one affiliate cannot exceed of the savings association s capital stock and surplus  and such transactions between the savings institution and all of its affiliates cannot  in the aggregate  exceed of the savings institution s capital stock and surplus

as insurer  the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of  and to require reporting by  fdic insured institutions 
it also may prohibit any fdic insured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the fdic 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings associations  after giving the ots an opportunity to take such action 
the fdic amended its risk based assessment system for to implement authority granted by the federal deposit insurance reform act of  as amended the reform act 
under the revised system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
risk category i is the lowest risk category while risk category iv is the highest risk category 
for and  the bank qualified for risk category i 
for banks under billion in total assets in risk category i  the and deposit assessment ranged from five to seven basis points of total qualified deposits 
the actual assessment is dependent upon certain risk measures as defined in the final rule 
the reform act also provided for a one time credit for eligible institutions based on their assessment base as of december  the bank s one time credit was  which was recognized in in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  institutions are required to make payments on bonds that were issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund

these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in fdic insurance expense  inclusive of assessments for the financing corporation bonds  totaled million in  and  net of its one time credit in in an effort to restore capitalization levels and to ensure the deposit insurance fund will adequately cover projected losses from future bank failures  the fdic  in october  proposed a rule to alter the way in which it differentiates for risk in the risk based assessment system and to revise deposit insurance assessment rates  including base assessment rates 
for the first quarter of only  the fdic increased all fdic deposit assessment rates by seven basis points 
these new rates range from to basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
under the fdic s restoration plan  the fdic proposes to establish new initial base assessment rates that will be subject to adjustment as described below 
beginning april   the base assessment rates would range from to basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for category iv institutions 
changes into the risk based assessment system would include increasing premiums for institutions that rely on excessive amounts of brokered deposits  including cdars  increasing premiums for excessive use of secured liabilities  including federal home loan bank advances  and lowering premiums for smaller institutions with very high capital levels 
on february   the fdic proposed amendments to the restoration plan for the deposit insurance fund 
this amendment proposes the imposition of a basis point emergency special assessment on insured depository institutions as of june  the assessment is proposed to be collected on september  the interim rule would also permit the fdic to impose an emergency special assessment after june   of up to ten basis points if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
based on average deposits for the fourth quarter  this special assessment  if implemented as proposed  would equal approximately million

item a 
risk factors ownership of the common stock or other securities of the company involves certain risks 
holders of the company s securities and prospective investors in those securities should carefully consider the following risk factors and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this report  in evaluating an investment in the company s securities 
if any of the risks and uncertainties discussed below actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  other risks and uncertainties of which we are not currently aware  including those relating to the banking and financial services industries in general  or which we do not now believe are material  may cause earnings to be lower  or impair our future financial condition or results of operations 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business our business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally 
the united states is currently in a recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions is greatly reduced and local governments and many businesses are experiencing serious financial difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
unemployment has increased significantly 
since mid  and particularly during the second half of  the financial services industry and the securities markets generally were materially and adversely affected by significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a serious lack of liquidity and a lack of financing for many investors 
market conditions have also led to the failure or merger of a number of prominent financial institutions 
in addition  declining asset values  defaults on mortgages and consumer loans  and the lack of market and investor confidence  as well as other factors  have all combined to cause rating agencies to lower credit ratings  and to otherwise increase the cost and decrease the availability of liquidity  despite very significant declines in federal reserve borrowing rates and other government actions 

table of contents some banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses and have become reluctant to lend  even on a secured basis  due to the increased risk of default and the impact of declining asset values on the value of collateral 
the foregoing has significantly weakened the strength and liquidity of some financial institutions 
in  the us government  the federal reserve and other regulators have taken numerous steps to increase liquidity and to restore investor confidence  including investing approximately billion in the equity of other banking organizations  but asset values have continued to decline and access to liquidity continues to be very limited 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of its borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the company operates  in the state of colorado and in the united states as a whole 
overall  during  the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the united states 
the business environment in colorado and the markets in which the company operates has been less adverse than in the united states generally but continues to deteriorate 
it is expected that the business environment in the state of colorado and the united states will continue to deteriorate for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term 
such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the company s loans  the value of the company s investment securities  and its overall results of operations and financial condition 
united western bank relies on institutional deposits 
a significant portion of united western bank s total deposits are funds deposited as a result of unaffiliated institutional relationships maintained by united western bank 
at december   six unrelated institutional relationships accounted for million of our total deposits including custodial escrow deposits 
sterling  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  accounted for million of our total deposits 
matrix financial solutions  inc  a company in which we own an approximate interest  accounted for million of our deposits and legent clearing  a company in which our chairman owns an indirect minority interest  accounted for million of our deposits 
institutional depositors generally are more sensitive to interest rate levels due to the amount of money they maintain on deposit than retail consumers who bank at a branch office 
the bank s future success in retaining and attracting institutional depositors depends  in part  on its ability to offer competitive rates and services 
with the unprecedented events in the financial markets in the united states over the past year  deposit concentrations are an increasing risk to all depository institutions and to the company 
if united western bank loses one or more of these institutional relationships  its liquidity  profitability and results of operations may be significantly and adversely affected 
see note to the financial statements 
our business is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the company s management of interest rate risk 

table of contents continued declines in interest rates would likely hurt our earnings 
the decline in market interest rates that occurred throughout and in particular in the fourth quarter negatively impacted our net interest income 
although interest rates are historically low  additional declines in interest rates are expected to have a negative impact on net interest income  net interest spread  net interest margin  and overall results of operations 
we believe that the continued implementation of our community bank business plan  and the resulting change in asset and liability mix  will partially mitigate the impact of lower market rates 
the bank s loan portfolio remains concentrated in real estate 
real estate lending including commercial  construction  land development  and residential remains a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio 
these categories constitute billion  or approximately of the bank s total loan portfolio as of december  real estate values are generally affected by changes in economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers  changes in tax and other laws and acts of nature 
a downturn in the real estate markets in which united western bank originates  purchases and services mortgage and other loans could hurt its business because these loans are secured by real estate 
in addition  even though the bank s real property collateral is currently located throughout the united states  the amount of such collateral in colorado  which at december  was million  or of our total loan portfolio  is likely to increase as a result of our community banking strategy 
a continuation of the downturn in the real estate markets where the bank has loans could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the bank s real estate loans also include million of construction loans and million of land development loans 
these loans have a historically greater risk of non payment and loss than other mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful completion and sale or operation of the property  the income stream of the borrowers  the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction 
such loans also typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential loans 
at december  there is one million nonperforming construction and development loan and another million asset that has been foreclosed 
if one or more of our larger borrowers were to default on their construction and development loans  we could incur significant losses 
at december   million  or  of our construction and development loans are for projects located in colorado 
we must effectively manage our credit risk 
there are risks inherent in making any loan  including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers  risks of nonpayment  risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions 
united western bank attempts to minimize its credit risk with prudent loan application approval procedures  including an analysis of the credit risk  a valuation of the underlying collateral  monitoring of loan concentration within specific industries and geographic locations and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by its loan review and audit departments 
nevertheless  we are exposed to significant credit risks  including possible errors in united western bank s credit analysis  the uncertainty of the borrower s ability to repay the loans  the uncertainty of future economic conditions and the possibility of loan defaults 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations balance sheet asset quality and balance sheet allowance for credit losses in this report 
our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance 
the company s allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses  and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the allowance for credit losses reflects the company s estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date 
the amount of actual losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the company s control  and these losses may exceed current estimates 
we cannot assure you that we will not increase the allowance for credit losses further or that regulators will not require united western bank to increase its allowance  either of which could adversely affect us 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations balance sheet asset quality and balance sheet allowance for credit losses in this report 

table of contents additional market concern over investment securities backed by mortgage loans could create losses in the company s investment portfolio 
a majority of the bank s investment portfolio is comprised of securities where mortgages are the underlying collateral 
these securities include agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities and nonagency mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
with the recent national downturn in real estate markets and the rising mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates  investors are increasingly concerned about these types of securities  which have negatively impacted the prices of such securities in the marketplace 
continued negative trends in the underlying mortgages could lead to material other than temporary impairment charges in the future 
the recoverability of our mortgage backed securities depends on the performance of the underlying loans in the related loan pools 
if credit losses on those loans were to exceed the subordinated tranches designed to credit enhance our securities  we would not receive the full stated interest due on the securities or our full principal balance  or both 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a significant estimate and is susceptible to change prospectively 
if we were to conclude there were unrealized losses which were other than temporary which we evaluate by considering estimates of recoverability  as well as the duration and severity of the unrealized loss we would be required under gaap to reduce the carrying amount of the security to fair value and record a corresponding charge to earnings  which would also reduce our regulatory capital and negatively impact the bank s capital ratios 
these negative impacts could significantly impair the bank s ability to borrow funds under credit arrangements  as well as various material depository arrangements and relationships 
in addition  if the bank determined it did not have the intent or ability to hold securities to maturity or recovery of temporary impairments  such impairments would be realized through earnings as other than temporary impairments 
temporary impairments on available for sale securities also reduce our book value per share as the changes in the value reduce stockholders equity 
although ots regulations do not proscribe capital ratio levels for the company per se  additional temporary impairments could reduce capital levels further and below levels management deems prudent

the mortgage loans that the bank holds are subject to risks of delinquency  foreclosure and loss  which could result in losses to us 
the residential and commercial mortgage loans held in the bank s loan portfolio are secured by residential and commercial properties and are subject to risks of delinquency  foreclosure and loss of principal and interest 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by residential property typically is dependent primarily upon the income or assets of the borrower 
in addition  other factors that affect the risk of our mortgage loan portfolio include property location and condition  competition and demand for comparable properties  changes in zoning laws for the property or its surrounding area  environmental contamination at the property  the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  declines in regional or local real estate values  increases in interest rates and or real estate tax rates  changes in governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  including environmental legislation and tax laws  and other events such as acts of god  natural disasters  war  terrorism  social unrest and civil disturbances 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower  the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy  as determined by the bankruptcy court 
the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law 
foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that can have a substantial negative effect on our originally anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan 
prospectively  it is possible there will be changes in bankruptcy laws  as well as other rules and regulations that impact delinquent mortgage loan borrowers that could negatively impact the total recovery we realize on mortgage loans 
the bank has invested in loan portfolios  pooled securities and mortgage backed obligations  which may lead to volatility in cash flow and market risk 
the bank s asset portfolio still contains large portfolios of single family residential loans acquired through bulk purchases  purchased sba loans and pools 
our investment portfolio largely consists of mortgage backed securities primarily secured by pools of mortgages on single family residences 
when the bank acquires such mortgage backed securities and loans  we anticipate that the underlying notes will prepay at a projected rate  thereby generating an expected yield 
prepayment rates generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise  but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict 
some of the bank s mortgage backed securities and many of our bulk single family loan purchases and purchased sba loans and pools were acquired at a premium purchase price 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  we will write off such premiums when necessary due to loan prepayments with respect to our held for sale loan portfolio and amortize such premiums over the expected lives of our mortgage backed securities and loans held for investment 
if the underlying assets that the bank acquired or that secures our mortgage backed securities prepays more rapidly than anticipated  we would have to write off or amortize the premium on an accelerated basis  which would adversely affect our profitability 

table of contents the carrying value of our residential mortgage loan servicing rights and our loan servicing income may decline 
owning residential mortgage loan servicing rights carries interest rate risk because its value and the total amount of servicing fees earned  as well as the amortization of the investment in the servicing rights  fluctuates based on interest rates and loan prepayments 
the rate of prepayment of mortgage loans may also be influenced by changing national and regional economic trends as well as the difference between interest rates on existing mortgage loans relative to prevailing mortgage rates 
during periods of declining interest rates  many borrowers refinance their mortgage loans 
accordingly  as prepayments of mortgage loans increase  the loan administration fee income related to the residential mortgage loan servicing rights corresponding to a mortgage loan ceases as mortgage loans are prepaid 
consequently  the market value of portfolios of residential mortgage loan servicing rights tends to decrease during periods of declining interest rates  since greater prepayments can be expected  and as a result  the amount of loan administration income received also decreases 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations balance sheet mortgage servicing rights in this report 
our quarterly results may fluctuate 
our financial results are subject to significant quarterly fluctuations as a result of  among other things  our loan production  opening of new branch locations  development of new products and services  premium amortization caused by prepayments of certain wholesale assets  such as our single family mortgage loans  guaranteed sba loans and pooled securities and changes in interest rates 
our operating results will fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including general economic conditions  economic conditions in the financial industry  the effects of governmental regulations and regulatory changes  capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of operations  the introduction of new services by us or our competitors and the mix of services sold 
in response to a changing competitive environment  we may elect from time to time to make certain pricing  service  or marketing decisions or enter into strategic alliances or make investments that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
accordingly  our results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any succeeding quarter or for the full fiscal year 
if we sell mortgage loans or mortgage servicing rights and the underlying loan defaults  we may be liable to the purchaser for unpaid principal and interest on the loan 
in the ordinary course of selling mortgage loans or mortgage servicing rights and in accordance with industry standards  we make certain representations and warranties to purchasers 
if a loan defaults and there has been a breach of representations or warranties and we have no recourse against a third party  we may become liable for the unpaid principal and interest on the defaulted loan 
in such a case  we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss on the loan 
when we purchase mortgage servicing rights or mortgage loans  we also are exposed to liability to the extent that an originator or other seller of the servicing rights is unable to honor its representations and warranties to us 
the company has established a reserve for repurchases that may be required in connection with loans we originated and sold in connection with the sale of our wholesale production platform in united western bank relies on wholesale funding sources for secondary and contingent liquidity sources 
united western bank utilizes borrowings from the fhlbank system  brokered certificates of deposits and repurchase agreements for secondary and contingent sources of liquidity 
also  from time to time  the bank utilizes these sources to capitalize on market opportunities to fund investment and loan initiatives 
if the bank were unable to obtain or maintain our access to funding or if adequate funding is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates  it would have to find alternative sources of liquidity  which  if available  would probably be at a higher cost and on terms that do not match the structure of our liabilities as well as the existing wholesale funding sources 
in addition  the company relies on wholesale bank funding for parent company funds 
if such funds were not available from the banking sector  securing alternative funding could cause disruption to our business 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations balance sheet borrowings and balance sheet liquidity in this report and note to the financial statements 

table of contents curtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could affect our sba business 
the bank s sba business relies on originating  purchasing  pooling and selling government guaranteed loans  in particular those guaranteed by the sba 
from time to time  the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal limits and cease to guarantee loans for a period of time 
in addition  these agencies may change their rules for loans or legislation may discontinue or change the programs 
if changes occur  the volumes of loans that qualify for government guarantees could decline  which could in turn reduce the profitability of the bank s sba business 
we are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities 
if we foreclose and take title to real estate  we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
failure in our automated systems and controls could subject us to increased operating or other liabilities 
we depend heavily upon our automated systems and controls for our business and operations 
these systems and controls support the evaluation  acquisition  monitoring  collection and administration of our loan and servicing portfolios  depository  general accounting and other management functions  as well as the brokerage functions we perform 
the failure of the automated systems  including a failure of data integrity or accuracy  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us against damage from physical break ins  security breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the internet or other users 
such computer break ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and deter potential customers 
although we  with the help of third party service providers  intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage  there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful 
a failure of such security measures could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
breaches of our computer and network security systems may result in customer information being compromised and or identity theft 
we maintain personal and financial information about our current  past and potential customers on our computer systems and network infrastructure  such as customer names  addresses  social security numbers  tax identification numbers  bank account numbers  information on loan applications and other sensitive personal and financial information about our customers 
in addition  our customers may use the internet to connect to united western bank s website to retrieve information about their accounts and to conduct online transactions  such as online bill payments 
if the security of our encrypted computer systems and network infrastructure responsible for storing our customers personal and financial data and information or the security of our online banking internet services is breached  then customer information could be stolen and misused 
such misuse could include the loss of privacy resulting from the sale or disclosure of the information to third parties  credit fraud or other consequences of identity theft to the customer 
while we believe that our current encrypted systems meet or exceed all commercial standards for network security  new criminal schemes or capabilities could compromise or breach our systems and network infrastructure 
if our security measures fail to protect our customer s information  our existing and future customer base may be adversely affected  we may become subject to customer claims or lawsuits  our public image may be diminished  and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations and the regulatory environment 
any change in the laws or regulations applicable to us  or in supervisory policies or examination procedures of banking regulators  whether by the ots  the fdic  the treasury  the fhlbank system  the united states congress  the texas department of banking  or other federal or state regulators could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in the exercise of their supervisory and enforcement powers 
they may  among other things  impose restrictions on the operation of a banking institution  the classification of assets by such institution and such institution s allowance for credit losses 
regulatory and law enforcement authorities also have wide discretion and extensive enforcement powers under various consumer protection and civil rights laws  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the truth in saving act  the federal trade commission act and colorado s deceptive trade practices act 
these laws also permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the recovery of attorneys fees in certain instances 
if our application for proceeds under the treasury s capital purchase program cpp is accepted  we will be required to enter into agreements with the treasury that the treasury may amend for any reason at any time 
we are unable to predict the scope or extent of any future amendments that treasury may mandate under its cpp documents all or some of which may impose additional regulatory burdens on us 
further  in order to accept cpp proceeds we will be required to enter into a source of strength agreement with the ots that will require us  as and when requested by the ots  to provide financial and managerial support to united western bank 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to supply the support requested by the ots due to limitations on our own financial and managerial resources at the time of such request and our failure to provide the requested support may lead to regulatory enforcement action or actions against us by the ots 
no assurance can be given that the foregoing regulations and supervision will not change so as to affect us adversely 
see item business regulation and supervision in this report 

table of contents sterling trust is subject to regulation as a trust company and could be the subject of third party actions 
as a texas chartered trust company  sterling is subject to supervision  regulation and examination by the texas department of banking 
sterling s activities are limited by applicable law generally to acting as a trustee  executor  administrator  guardian or agent for the performance of any lawful act  and to lend and accumulate money when authorized under applicable law 
even though sterling does not provide investment advice or maintain discretion with regard to the investment choices made by its customers or their representatives  sterling has been in the past  and may be in the future  subject to claims by third parties regarding breach of contract  breach of fiduciary duty  or similar claims alleging violation of duty or law 
while we believe applicable law supports our view of sterling s duties  or lack thereof  in that regard  there can be no assurances that we will prevail in any litigation or other proceeding challenging the matter 
our ability to service our debt and pay dividends is subject to our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries 
we are a separate legal entity from our subsidiaries and do not have significant operations of our own 
we currently depend on our cash  credit facilities and liquidity as well as dividends from our subsidiaries to pay our operating expenses and service our debt 
there is no assurance that our subsidiaries will continue to have the capacity to pay us the necessary dividends to satisfy our obligations 
in particular  the availability of dividends from united western bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
depending upon the financial condition of the bank and other factors  it is possible that the ots could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments by the bank are an unsafe or unsound practice 
if the bank or our other subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends sufficient to satisfy our obligations  we may not be able to service our debt  pay our obligations as they become due or pay dividends on our common stock 
significant legal actions could subject the company to substantial liabilities 
the company is from time to time subject to various legal claims related to its operations 
these claims and legal actions  including potential supervisory actions by the company s regulators  could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs 
as a result  the company may be exposed to substantial liabilities  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our business strategy we may be unable to retain our senior management 
the execution of our business strategy relies in significant part on our ability to hire and retain competent  experienced management 
as discussed in item above under business regulation and supervision we have applied for proceeds under the treasury s cpp program 
if we accept such proceeds we will be subject to as yet unknown and to be promulgated treasury regulations under new section that will materially restrict the amount and type of compensation we may pay to our senior management as discussed in item business regulation and supervision above 
to the extent the imposition of compensation limits under such regulations and the provisions of new section cause members of our senior management to seek employment elsewhere  the implementation of our business plan may suffer until such time as we can find adequate replacements for such departing executives 
we may be unable to fully implement our community banking business strategy 
we are three years into our community bank transition and in order to complete the execution of this strategy we must  among other things attract sufficient commercial business and retail deposits  attract and maintain business banking relationships with businesses in the markets in which we serve  attract and retain experienced and successful commercial and community bankers  identify and pursue suitable opportunities for opening new branches in the colorado front range and selected mountain community markets  maintain adequate regulatory capital and comply with applicable federal and state regulations  and originate community bank loans and maintain adequate asset quality 
failure to achieve these strategic goals could adversely affect our ability to fully implement our community banking business strategies as well as our overall financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to effectively manage our proposed growth 
our business strategy contemplates  in part  an increase in our franchise value by expanding into additional communities in the colorado front range and selected mountain communities through a branch network for united western bank 
to the extent that we undertake additional branch openings  we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from our expansion efforts for a period of time 
we expect to open another branch in the early spring of  we intend to make our loan production office in aspen  colorado a full service branch  and we may acquire other sites for future expansion 
while we are committed to this strategy  our expansion could significantly burden our infrastructure or we may be unable to manage this growth 
in addition  we may enter new lines of business or pursue other strategies intended to complement our community banking business plan implementation 
to the extent we undertake such actions  we may experience higher operating costs and these new activities may not be successful 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel 
our business strategy requires us to attract and to retain management experienced in community banking and financial services who live in the communities we serve 
our ability to retain our existing executive officers  regional presidents  and community banking staff is important to the successful implementation of our strategy 
the unexpected loss of key personnel or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have an adverse effect on our business 
adverse economic conditions in the colorado front range and our mountain community markets could impair the execution of our business strategy 
the success of our business strategy depends primarily on the general economic conditions in our markets because local economic conditions will materially affect commercial real estate  including construction and land development  and residential loans originated  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
if we divest other non core businesses  it could adversely affect our financial results 
we successfully divested several businesses in if we do elect to divest any of our remaining subsidiaries  the effect of such disposition could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to ownership of our common stock the trading volume of our stock is low 
the low trading volume in our common shares on nasdaq means that our shares may have less liquidity than other publicly traded companies 
we cannot ensure that the volume of trading in our common shares will increase in the future 
furthermore  to the extent shares are concentrated in a relatively small group of holders  a seller could be subject to significant adverse price volatility and price fluctuation 
at december   based on filings made by third parties with the securities and exchange commission  we believe that six holders owned of our outstanding common stock 
this includes shares held by our chairman of the board  guy a 
gibson who owns  shares  or of our outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional shares may cause dilution and other risks 
our board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional common or preferred stock in connection with future equity offerings  acquisitions of securities or assets of other companies 
furthermore  there are significant implementation risks associated with the acquisition and integration of another entity into our company that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the board may also classify or reclassify any unissued preferred stock and set the preferences  rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares  including the issuance of preferred stock with preference rights over the common stock with respect to dividends  liquidation  voting and other matters 
in any event  the issuance of additional shares of our common stock could be dilutive to shareholders that do not invest in future offerings 
moreover  to the extent that we issue options  warrants or similar instruments to purchase our common stock in the future and those options  warrants or similar instruments are exercised or we issue restricted stock which subsequently vests  shareholders may experience future dilution 

table of contents preferred shares issued pursuant to the economic emergency stabilization act of  as amended  will impact net income available to holders of our common shares and earnings per common share and the related warrant to be issued to the us treasury may be dilutive to holders of our common shares 
as disclosed above  we have applied for an investment by the treasury under the tarp cpp pursuant to the eesa  as amended 
if the treasury agrees to make such investment in us  the terms of such investment will include the issuance of a senior preferred stock coupled with warrant coverage 
see item business regulation and supervision economic emergency stabilization act of  above 
while the additional capital we may raise through our participation in the cpp will provide further funding to our business and we believe will improve investor perceptions with regard to our financial position  it will increase our equity and the number of actual and diluted outstanding common shares as well as our preferred stock dividend requirements 
the dividends declared and the accretion of discount on the preferred stock issued to treasury will reduce the net income available to holders of our common shares and our earnings per common share 
the preferred shares will also receive preferential treatment in the event of our liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common shares will be diluted to the extent the warrant we will be required to issue to the treasury in conjunction with the sale of the preferred shares is exercised 
because the number of commons shares available to the treasury under the warrant is not determined until the final closing  which will take place  if at all  after the date of this report  we are unable to currently determine the number of common shares we will have to make available to the treasury under the warrant 
although the treasury has agreed not to vote any of the common shares it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any common shares acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction 
control by our executive officers and directors may limit the influence of shareholder voting and could discourage an acquisition by third parties 
as of march   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
these shareholders  if acting together  would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of our board of directors  the approval of mergers or other transactions or events requiring shareholder approval 
this concentration of ownership  among other factors  could delay or prevent a change in control of the company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer  which in turn could prevent our shareholders from realizing an acquisition premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
we may not have the ability to pay dividends in the future 
the board of directors adopted a quarterly dividend payment in while our board of directors intends to continue to declare dividends in the future if and to the extent warranted by our financial condition and cash availability  the board s determination whether to pay future dividends will depend on a number of factors  including but not limited to our future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and future prospects 
we are also prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if the scheduled payments on our junior subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities have not been made and will be further prohibited if we participate in the tarp cpp to the extent we do not pay dividends on any senior preferred stock issued in connection therewith

item legal proceedings general 
we are from time to time party to various litigation matters  in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business 
we accrue for contingent liabilities with respect to litigation matters in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which generally requires the company to accrue a loss for a litigation matter involving a contingent liability if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
in order to determine whether the two conditions necessary for accrual are met  management necessarily makes a number of judgments and assumptions 
because the outcome of most litigation matters is inherently uncertain  the company will generally only accrue a loss for a pending litigation matter if  for example  the parties to the matter have entered into definitive settlement agreements or a final judgment adverse to the company has been entered 
in many cases  these settlements or final judgments are not material to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company

the case  which was subsequently removed to the us district court in idaho on december   is based on the plaintiffs claims that first matrix should have made certain disclosures regarding the risk of the withdrawal of a usda government guarantee of the bond  which withdrawal subsequently occurred and the bond went into default 
in june of  the court dismissed the underwriter  duncan williams  from the lawsuit based on lack of personal jurisdiction  however  based on the testimony of certain depositions in this matter  the court has scheduled an evidentiary hearing in march of to determine whether the court does have personal jurisdiction over duncan williams 
the company and uwis may seek indemnification for the claims made against them in this case from the underwriter or from other potentially responsible parties

for the quarter ended december  net interest margin was  the basis point increase in the net interest margin from the fourth quarter of and was principally due to our management of interest expense and continuing growth of community bank loans that replaced wholesale loans 
provision for credit losses expense increased  between the third and fourth quarters of the provision for credit losses expense of million for the fourth quarter of was the result of the million of growth net of repayments in the community bank loan portfolio  an increase in specific impairments of  for one commercial loan  and approximately million related to other existing loans that demonstrated signs of weakness for which the loan grade was reduced as well as a continued decline in general economic conditions

noninterest income was million for the quarter ended december   compared to million for the quarter ended december  and million for the quarter ended september  the decrease in the year over year period was due principally to continued declining loan administration income that is associated with the reduction of our mortgage servicing portfolio

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under item a 
risk factors  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item in this report 
recent market developments the economy is experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system during the past year 
declines in the housing market during the past year  due to falling home prices and increased foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in substantial declines in mortgage related asset values  which has had a dramatic negative impact on government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
reflecting concern about the stability of the finance markets in general and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased  to provide funding and liquidity to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  specifically the troubled asset relief program tarp thereunder  the us treasury will have the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the secretary of the department of the treasury announced the department of the treasury will purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts through tarp s capital purchase program the cpp 
under this program  from the billion authorized by the eesa  the treasury made billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury received  from participating financial institutions  warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred stock investment 
participating financial institutions were required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity in such institution issued under the cpp 
on november   the board of directors of the fdic adopted a final rule relating to the temporary liquidity guarantee program the tlgp 
the tlgp was announced by the fdic on october   after the determination of systemic risk by the secretary of the department of treasury after consultation with the president  as an initiative to counter the system wide crisis in the nation s financial sector 
under the tlgp the fdic will i guarantee  through the earlier of maturity or june   certain newly issued senior unsecured debt issued by participating institutions on or after october   and before june  and ii provide full fdic insurance deposit insurance coverage for noninterest bearing transaction deposit accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts paying less than interest per annum and interest on lawyers trust accounts iolta accounts held at participating fdic insured institutions through december  coverage under the tlgp was available for the first days without charge 
the fee assessment for coverage of senior unsecured debt ranges from basis points to basis points per annum  depending on the initial maturity of the debt 
the fee assessment for deposit insurance coverage is basis points per quarter on amounts in covered accounts exceeding  on november   the company made application through its regulator  the ots  to participate in the cpp 
the ots forwarded the company s application to the department of treasury and the company expects it will be informed in the normal course of business of the department of treasury s consideration 
the company s board of directors will consider accepting cpp proceeds  should we have the opportunity to do so 
if accepted the company plans to use its proceeds from the cpp to improve the capital ratios of the bank and the company and to prudently provide additional credit to customers in the markets we serve 
on february   president obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of into law  which  among other things  amends and replaces section of eesa which formed the basis of a number of the executive compensation restriction limits imposed by eesa 
see item business regulation and supervision american recovery and reinvestment act of the effect of this act upon our operations is not  as yet  fully understood 
however  should the company participate in the eesa  particularly the cpp  in the future  there will likely be changes in our operations some of which may have adverse consequences to our ability to execute on our strategy 

table of contents on february   the fdic proposed amendments to the restoration plan for the deposit insurance fund 
this amendment proposes the imposition of a basis point emergency special assessment on insured depository institutions as of june  the assessment is proposed to be collected on september  the interim rule would also permit the fdic to impose an emergency special assessment after june   of up to ten basis points if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
based on average deposits for the fourth quarter  this special assessment  if implemented as proposed  would equal approximately million 
this special assessment if implemented as proposed will have a significant impact on the results of operations of the company for overview for the year ended december   income from continuing operations was million compared to million for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for were or 
lower than the per share in total assets at december  were billion  which represented an increase of million from december  total community bank loans  inclusive of both loans held for sale and loans held for investment increased million during to billion 
run off of investment securities and wholesale loans offset a significant portion of the growth of community bank loans 
we have completed three years of our five to seven year transformation to a community banking enterprise 
we opened our seventh regional banking location  located at hampden avenue in south denver in december and plan to open one additional location  centennial in the spring of we are considering three additional organic growth locations in colorado s front range 
our decision to move forward on the continued organic growth of our distribution network will be tied to the overall economic environment  our availability of capital to fund the growth and general market conditions 
in prior financial statement filings  the company presented the valuation allowance to reduce loans held for sale to the lower of cost or fair value in two components  one an allowance for credit losses that separately considered credit loss exposure and one valuation allowance that separately considered market risk factors 
management has reclassified prior period financial statements to reflect the valuation allowance to reduce loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value as one valuation allowance balance 
this revision to our presentation  reduced provision for credit losses for the years ended   and to    and  respectively  from the previous presentation of provision for credit losses of    and  for the same periods  respectively 
offsetting the reduction in provision for credit losses  was an increase in other expense lower of cost or fair value adjustment 
the lower of cost or fair value adjustment for the year ended december     and was    and  respectively  and is now presented as    and  for those same periods  respectively 
this reclassification and other reclassifications made to these financial statements had no impact on total assets  shareholders equity  or net income for any period 
between and we increased net interest income before provision for credit losses by million and our net interest margin grew basis points from for to for with the reductions in interest rates that occurred in the second half of  we believe it will be difficult for the company to increase its net interest margin in given the state of the national economy and the prospects for further contraction in the colorado state economy in  we believe it is possible that there will be an increase in our nonperforming community bank assets  despite our careful underwriting standards 
we believe our asset quality should remain better than most of our peers  however  our asset quality will reflect the conditions of the customers and markets we serve going forward

the increase in volume of million resulted in additional interest income of million 
for  the yield on community bank loans was compared to for this basis point decrease in yield contributed to an offsetting reduction of million in interest income 
the increase in volume is due to the continued execution of our business plan  the decline in rates was due to market factors 
a significant portion of our community bank loans are variable rate and during  the prime rate of interest declined from at december  to at december  interest income on wholesale interest bearing assets declined by million  based on a million decline in volume and a basis points decrease in the yield on such assets 
the decline in wholesale interest bearing assets is consistent with our business plan to divest these assets in an orderly fashion over time as we transition the balance sheet to that of a traditional community bank 
the yield on wholesale residential loans and mortgage backed securities declined to for as compared to for the decrease in the yield on these assets was due principally to the decreases in market interest rates 
the majority of the wholesale assets are also variable rate including the purchased guaranteed portions of sba a loans  which are tied to prime  and the residential mortgage loans for which the significant majority have reached their initial reset date and now fluctuate at least annually 
interest expense decreased million to million for as compared to million for this decrease was caused by a decline in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities of to for compared to for the average rate paid for our interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points due to changes in market rates and management actions 
in the third quarter of  we redeemed million of junior subordinated debt  which resulted in a lower overall cost of interest bearing liabilities 
additionally  the decline in both libor and federal funds rates that occurred during contributed to the overall decline in rates paid 
the decline in rates contributed million to the decline in interest expense for average interest bearing liabilities increased million between and and this increase in average balance offset the decline in rate by million

average interest bearing liabilities decreased million 
due to the change in the mix of liabilities  although the average rate declined  the rate on money market and now accounts which comprise the majority of our interest bearing liabilities increased to for compared to and overall the change in rate caused a million increase in interest expense 
the decline in average balance of million resulted in a savings of million for a total reduction in interest expense of million for provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level that is management s best estimate of probable incurred credit losses inherent in the held for investment loan portfolio 
the provision for credit losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in the provision for was the result of the million of net new community bank loans added to the portfolio  an increase in specific impairments associated with loans that became nonperforming during the year  other loans that demonstrated signs of weakness for which the loan grade was reduced and a decline in the general economic conditions

the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based on the discounted future servicing income stratified based on one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the company stratifies its mortgage servicing rights by product type and investor  among other things  to reflect the predominant risks 
to determine the fair value of its investment  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows 
due to changes in the interest rate environment during the periods  among other factors  an impairment recovery against the valuation of the asset was recognized in while it is not possible to make a fair estimate at this time as to whether future impairments or recoveries will occur  further changes in market interest rates  or increases in anticipated future prepayment speeds  may cause additional impairment charges in future periods 
the impairment or recovery on mortgage servicing rights is included in expenses of our mortgage banking operating segment

fdic insurance costs increased  to million in compared to based on higher deposit balances and an increase in the assessment rate 
we estimate such costs will increase prospectively due to an increase in the assessment rate that was effective january  also increasing other general and administrative expenses in were costs incurred for the new custodial record system at sterling

the contractual maturities of the company s investment securities portfolio is considerably longer than the expected lives due to repayments anticipated from the mortgagors that represent the underlying collateral of the securities 

table of contents at december   the company s mortgage backed investment security portfolio had an amortized cost of million and consisted of four classes of securities agency securities  prime collateralized mortgage obligations cmo  alt a cmos  and cmos collateralized by payment option adjustable rate mortgages 
the company s available for sale mortgage backed investment security portfolio was comprised of instruments with an estimated fair value of million and the held to maturity portfolio was comprised of securities with an amortized cost of million  both as shown in the table below based on lowest rating assigned by credit rating agency at december  available for sale total agency aaa aa a bbb bbb dollars in thousands agency mortgage pass through cmo prime cmo alt a cmo option arm based on lowest rating assigned by credit rating agency at december  held to maturity total agency aaa aa a bbb bbb dollars in thousands agency mortgage pass through mortgage pass through cmo prime cmo alt a based on the highest rating assigned  approximately of the portfolio is investment grade

available for sale cmo prime is comprised of securities with underlying hybrid adjustable rate mortgages  which initially reset in mid these securities have credit support at december  current credit support was greater than two times foreclosure levels at december  of this population approximately was aaa rated by at least one agency  and management believes this population has sufficient credit support for delinquency trends observed 
on a weighted average basis  for tranches subordinated to those owned by the company  cumulative losses were 
available for sale cmo alt a is comprised of one fixed rate security with credit support at december  this security had a current level of credit support in excess of two times foreclosure levels and the underlying loan collateral had a weighted average loan to value of 
this security is the most senior tranche in the issue  and there were no cumulative losses in the security to date 
available for sale cmo option arm is comprised of five variable rate securities with credit support 
each of these securities has received at least one ratings downgrade and one security has two ratings below investment grade 
delinquency levels among this asset class have been trending upwards 
our analyses of the modeled cash flows from each of these securities continues to indicate that it is probable all scheduled principal and interest payments due to the security we hold will be received 

table of contents held to maturity agency mortgage pass through is comprised of securities issued through fhlmc and fnma and are all fixed rate securities acquired to assist the bank in fulfilling its community reinvestment act responsibilities

held to maturity cmo prime is comprised of securities with credit support at december  and moderate levels of delinquencies in total 
credit support levels remain more than several times in excess of cumulative losses recognized to date  and are expected to increase as subordinate tranches of these securities pay off 
two of the securities in this population were subject to an other than temporary impairment charge in the third quarter of due to the extent and duration of the decline in market value below amortized cost  given consideration to current illiquidity in the marketplace and uncertainty of a recovery of expected future cash flows 
held to maturity cmo alt a is comprised of securities with credit support at december  and moderate and stable levels of delinquencies 
we expect delinquency statistics in all classes of these securities to level off  and roll rates from delinquency to foreclosure to reo to be reduced by private industry loan restructuring programs  as well as the homeowner affordability and stability plan recently signed into federal law 
the available for sale portfolio is comprised of the securities shown above and includes five securities with an estimated fair value of million  and an amortized cost of million that represent all of the cmos collateralized by payment option adjustable rate mortgages 
of these securities  two have received a downgrade from one or more of the rating agencies to below investment grade based on the lowest rating assigned to the security at december  the securities that have been downgraded are the same securities that comprise the overwhelming majority of the decline in fair value of the available for sale securities 
at december   the fair value of the available for sale securities was million less than the cost  net of tax 
this loss is an unrealized loss recognized in other comprehensive income 
based on management s review of analyses performed by independent third parties and consideration of other information  we believe the decline in fair value represents a temporary impairment due to current economic conditions 
the held to maturity portfolio is comprised of the securities shown above and based on the lowest rating assigned of this portfolio continues to be rated aa or higher and investment grade or higher 
based on internal analyses and analyses performed by independent third parties  we believe the decline in fair value on the remaining securities is a temporary impairment due to inactive markets 
management reviews the pricing of each security at least quarterly 
as discussed above  management receives pricing from four primary sources 
two are widely known pricing services 
the other two are independent consultants that perform fair market valuation for securities identified by management as requiring additional analysis in order to ascertain fair value in accordance with sfas management obtains the fair value indications from the pricing service in the ordinary course of business 
management reviews the fair value indications for reasonableness given the ratings  decline in fair value as indicated by the general pricing services  and other credit factors 
also  management reviews the disparity in prices between the two pricing services 
if there is significant disparity in the two prices  and the security unpaid principal balance is over million  and if the fair value indication seems disconnected in comparison to the performance characteristics of the security  such securities are submitted to the other independent consultants to assess the reasonableness of fair values received 
the fair values received are reviewed by the bank s asset liability committee and at bank investment committee meetings  board of director meetings  and regular portfolio monitoring meetings 
the review includes an analysis of all securities owned by the company and various metrics for each security  including original and current ratings  collateral characteristics  repayment rates  cumulative loss rates and other factors 
we believe that current macroeconomic conditions have significantly impacted the fair value of the company s securities portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio contains several securities that have a severe decline in fair value in comparison to the amortized cost 
certain securities have been downgraded since acquisition by one or more of the nationally recognized ratings agencies 
however  the company s independently prepared cash flow forecasts support management s conclusions that it is probable the company will fully recover the amortized cost of the securities based upon assumptions that would be used by other market participants 
management s conclusion that impairment is temporary is based upon several factors 
those factors include credit rating  duration and severity of impairment  management s intent and ability to hold to recovery or maturity based upon the classification of the security  and independent analyses of the residential mortgages underlying such securities among others 
these factors in certain circumstances involve significant management estimates  and support management s conclusions that impairments are temporary 
in circumstances where these factors lead to a conclusion that impairment is other than temporary  the security is written down through a charge to earnings to its estimated fair value 

table of contents in the event securities demonstrate additional deterioration through an increase in defaults or loss severity that indicate the company will not recover its anticipated cash flows or if the duration of relatively significant impairments in these securities does not reverse  the company will incur other than temporary impairments  which may result in material charges to earnings in future periods 
loan portfolio 
our major interest earning asset is our loan portfolio 
a significant part of our asset and liability management involves monitoring the composition of our loan portfolio  including the corresponding maturities 
community bank loans include commercial real estate loans  construction and development loans  commercial loans  multifamily loans and consumer loans 
wholesale loans include legacy purchased residential loans and purchased guaranteed portions of sba a loans

the increases for in community banking loan categories were primarily due to the successful marketing efforts of our regional banking teams 
through the continued execution of our business plan  we anticipate continued declines of wholesale loans  both residential and purchased sba  and continued growth of community bank loans 
based on the current economic environment  we expect a smaller increase in the community bank portfolio in than in prior years 
we also anticipate a continued change in the loan mix prospectively with a continuing increase in community bank loans and continued run off through repayment of wholesale loans 
we note that repayments of mortgage loans for was lower than our historical experience 
we believe it is possible that based on the actions taken by the government to reduce interest rates  increased activity at fannie mae and freddie mac  that there could be an increase in residential loan repayment levels in relative to  however  there are no assurances that such increases will materialize 
we anticipate that commercial and commercial real estate loans will increase as a percentage of the portfolio while construction and development loans will not exceed current levels

within the construction portfolio the loan breakdown is approximately family  commercial  multifamily and consumer 
with few exceptions  the land loans that have been underwritten are based on marketability of the lots or are made in anticipation of vertical construction 
land loans have an identified source of repayment other than the resale of raw land 
the bank has been very selective in the origination of loans in this asset class  and has no community bank land loans without personal recourse as a part of its underwriting 
there are additional risks associated with c d lending as compared to our other lending as discussed above in item business community banking lending residential and commercial construction and development lending 
to address and mitigate these risks  we rigorously monitor the c d portfolio 
the c d portfolio is monitored for total overall concentration levels for which our goal is to maintain c d loans in the range of to of the community bank loan portfolio 
we also monitor geographic breakdown  and the overall c d portfolio speculative to pre sale ratios as well as the factors that are relevant to all loans 
at december   we have defined nine geographic regions for our c d portfolio  eight in colorado and one region for loans outside colorado 
within colorado  four of the defined geographic regions account for million  or of the c d portfolio  denver metropolitan area million  or  northeastern colorado  principally fort collins  million  or  i corridor and mountain communities million  or  and northern colorado  principally steamboat springs  million  or 
c d loans outside colorado represent million  or  of the portfolio 
our speculative to pre sale ratio is approximately to at december commercial real estate loans  including multifamily loans increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  management directed its banking teams to emphasize commercial real estate over c d lending in based on economic conditions and other factors 
the commercial real estate portfolio is geographically located as follows denver metropolitan area  i corridor and mountain communities  fort collins   other colorado areas  and outside colorado 
there is a higher percentage of the commercial real estate portfolio located outside of colorado due to our national sba lending footprint  and from older multifamily and single tenant loans that were originated prior to wholesale residential loans declined million during and declined million during the residential loan portfolio represents loans that primarily were purchased in the secondary market prior to september  at which time we stopped purchasing such assets 
sba purchased guaranteed portions represent the guaranteed portions of sba a loans we acquired prior to march sba purchased loans declined million during and million during due to repayment 
we expect the balance of these portfolios to decline prospectively  which is consistent with our plan to reduce the amount of wholesale loans on our balance sheet 

table of contents the following table presents the aggregate maturities of loans in each major category of our loan portfolio as of december   excluding the allowance for credit losses

the sba purchased loans are placed on nonaccrual after a period of nonperformance 
however  the loans are guaranteed and historically the company has realized full value of principal and collected all past due interest 
the increase in nonperforming community bank loans held for investment was principally the result of one c d loan that became delinquent in the first quarter of the loan is currently impaired with a million specific allowance allocation 
the following table sets forth our nonperforming assets held for sale as of the dates indicated as of december  dollars in thousands residential school financing total wholesale multifamily total community bank total nonperforming loans held for sale reo total nonperforming assets held for sale nonperforming loans held for sale increased due principally to two legacy out of state multifamily loans that became delinquent during the year 
our credit administration team has an identified course of action for both of these loans that should maximize our realization of these assets 
as part of our asset quality function  we monitor all nonperforming assets on a regular basis 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or  except for government guaranteed sponsored loans  when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
during the ordinary course of business  management may become aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of loan agreements 
these loans are placed under close supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  increasing the allowance for credit losses and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
non accrual loans are further classified as impaired when underlying collateral is not sufficient to cover the loan balance and it is probable that we will not fully collect all principal and interest 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any interest previously accrued but not yet collected is reversed against current income 
if interest payments are received on non accrual loans  these payments will be applied to principal and not taken into income 
loans will not be placed back on accrual status unless back interest and principal payments are made 
for certain government sponsored loans such as fha insured and va guaranteed loans  we continue to accrue interest when the loan is past due or more days  if and to the extent that the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government 
the aggregate unpaid principal balance of government sponsored accruing loans that were past due or more days was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the growth between and is the result of additional purchases of government insured loans out of our servicing portfolio 
these accruing loans are not included in the balances of nonperforming loans above 

table of contents foreclosed real estate represents properties acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings and are initially recorded at fair value  less estimated selling costs when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
foreclosed real estate is evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amount is supported by its current fair value 
direct charges to the basis of the asset that reduce the carrying amount to fair value less estimated costs of disposal and are recorded as necessary 
revenues and expenses from the operations of real estate owned and charges for necessary write downs are included in other income and other expenses on the income statement 
we are very pleased with the performance to date of the community bank asset quality and with the performance of our credit administration team to reduce the risks from legacy commercial loan assets that existed at the time of our transition 
however  given current economic conditions  we anticipate that unless there is an increase in overall economic activity in the state of colorado and nationally  nonperforming loans may increase prospectively over current levels 
in such a case  additional allowance for credit losses would be required  which would in turn negatively impact our results of operations 
at december   we owned approximately  of residential loans that met the regulatory definition of subprime at the date of purchase or origination 
in prior years  the company  through our mortgage banking subsidiary  matrix financial services  originated subprime mortgages and occasionally united western bank purchased subprime mortgages 
these activities ceased several years ago  and the company s current holdings represent the remainder of such activities 
the company is not now active in the subprime market and has no intention of becoming involved in the future 
allowance for credit losses 
in prior financial statement filings  the company presented the valuation allowance to reduce loans held for sale to the lower of cost or fair value in two components  one an allowance for credit losses that separately considered credit loss exposure and one valuation allowance that separately considered market risk factors 
management has reclassified prior period financial statements to reflect the valuation allowance to reduce loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value as one valuation allowance balance 
this revision to our presentation  reduced provision for credit losses for the years ended   and to    and  respectively  from the previous presentation of provision for credit losses of    and  for the same periods  respectively 
offsetting the reduction in provision for credit losses  was an increase in other expense lower of cost or fair value adjustment 
the lower of cost or fair value adjustment for the year ended december     and was    and  respectively  and is now presented as    and  for those same periods  respectively 
this reclassification and other reclassifications made to these financial statements had no impact on total assets  shareholders equity  or net income for any period 
management believes the allowance for credit losses is critical to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
selection and application of this critical accounting policy involves judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to occur  and depending upon the severity of such changes  materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable possibility 
we maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the collectibility of loans  underlying collateral  geographic and other concentrations  and prior loss experience 
we use a risk rating system to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
with this system  each loan  with the exception of those included in large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  is risk rated between one and ten  by the originating loan officer  credit administration  loan review or loan committee  with one being the best case and ten being a loss or the worst case 
estimated loan default factors are multiplied against loan balances and then multiplied by a historical loss given default rate by loan type to determine an appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses 
a specific reserve may be needed on a loan by loan basis 
loans with risk ratings between six and nine are monitored more closely by the loan officer  credit administration  and the asset quality committee  and may result in specific reserves 
the allowance for credit losses also includes an element for estimated probable but undetected losses and for imprecision in the loan loss models discussed above 

table of contents the following table sets forth information regarding changes in our allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated

net charge offs of  for consisted principally of a group of construction and development loans in which the builder was convicted of fraud 
the majority of net charge offs for and were related to the wholesale residential including losses related to the loan production at matrix financial services 
the provision for credit losses was million for compared to million for and million for the provision is based on the results of our quarterly analyses of the loan portfolios and change in the mix of the loan portfolios 
generally  the increase in compared to was due to loan growth of million in the held for investment loan portfolio primarily related to commercial real estate  construction and development and commercial loans which have a higher inherent risk  asset quality issues and the current economic conditions 
the provision for credit losses in was comprised of held for investment loan portfolio growth of million and to a lesser extent asset quality issues associated with a handful of loans 
the provision made in was due to community bank loan growth and our reevaluation of loss factors related to loan loss reserve levels associated with our loan portfolio 
during the first quarter  our credit risk management team revised the estimated loss factors that are applied to certain loans to reflect our experience with inherent losses in these types of loans 
the provision for and related to the wholesale legacy assets and asset quality issues in those periods

generally  residential loans are becoming a smaller portion of the held for investment loan portfolio as such loans are repaying  and being replaced by commercial real estate  construction and development  and commercial loans which have a higher inherent risk 
the allowance for credit losses on residential loans held for investment was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance for credit losses for residential loans is reflective of the increasing trend over the past three years in nonperforming residential loans and declining property values 
the reserve in prior years was impacted by the production activities at matrix financial services 
the ratio of the allowance for credit losses for community bank loans to total community bank loans held for investment was   and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in the ratio of the allowance between and is due to an increase in nonperforming loans 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses increased by  to  at december   compared to  at december  the increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance compared to the prior years is associated with the increased volume of commercial real estate  construction and development  and commercial loans  which have a higher inherent risk in the portfolio  as well as the overall real estate concentration in the portfolio both nationally and in colorado 
as of december   we believe that the allowance  when taken as a whole  is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio

we anticipate continuing declines of these balances prospectively 
the following table shows the delinquency statistics for the mortgage loans serviced through matrix financial services  excluding loans subserviced for others  as of the dates presented 
delinquencies and foreclosures for the mortgage loans serviced by us generally exceed the national average due to high rates of delinquencies and foreclosures on certain bulk loan and bulk servicing portfolios 
the higher levels of delinquencies result in a higher cost of servicing  however  a portion of the higher cost is offset by the collection of late fees

during periods of declining interest rates  prepayments of mortgage loans usually increase as homeowners seek to refinance at lower interest rates  resulting in a decrease in the value of the servicing portfolio 
mortgage loans with higher interest rates and or higher principal balances are more likely to result in prepayments because the cost savings to the borrower from refinancing can be significant 
although prepayments may increase with the decline in the interest rates that has occurred and other government actions  the company s portfolio is comprised of loans with an average age of years  average balance of  and average rate of 
thus actual prepayment speeds have tended to be lower than national averages for several years 
the following table shows the annualized prepayment rate for each quarter and the annual average prepayment rate experience on the mortgage loans serviced by matrix financial services  excluding loans subserviced by and for others for the years ended december  quarter ended december september june march annual average valuation of servicing rights 
our servicing portfolio is accounted for in accordance with the guidelines set forth in sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and sfas  accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
under sfas  we are required to record our investment in mortgage servicing rights at the lower of cost or fair value 
the estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights msrs is determined by reference to the discounted future servicing income  as stratified in accordance with one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the company stratifies its msrs by product type  interest rate and investor to reflect the predominant risk characteristics 
to determine the estimated fair value of msrs  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of discounted future cash flows 
in using this valuation model  the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which includes estimates of the cost of servicing per loan  including incremental interest cost of servicer advances  foreclosure expenses and losses  the discount rate  float value  an inflation rate  ancillary income per loan  prepayment speeds and default rates 
for purposes of performing an impairment analysis on msrs  the company estimates fair value using the following primary assumptions average prepayment speeds of cpr  constant prepayment rate  a prepayment speed measurement ranging from cpr to cpr  an average discount rate of  with discount rates ranging from to  and average delinquency of  with default rates ranging from to 
at december   the company s residential servicing portfolio consists of seasoned loans with an approximate year average age  an average balance of  and a weighted average note rate of 

table of contents at december   we recorded a permanent impairment of million 
during  we established a million valuation allowance for the impairment of mortgage servicing rights 
in the year ended december  we recorded a net recovery of compared to a net recovery  for the year ended december  impairment recoveries were highly correlated to the changes in interest rates and resultant mortgage loan prepayment speeds that occurred during those periods 
our impairment reserve as of december  was  further decreases in interest rates  or other factors that result in an increase in anticipated future prepayment speeds  may cause additional impairment charges in future periods 
it is possible to hedge the risk associated with declines in the value of mortgage servicing rights with derivatives  however  based on the underlying characteristics of our portfolio  and our decision not to increase our investment in mortgage servicing  we do not currently anticipate that we will enter into any future hedge specific to our investment for the foreseeable future 
risk management activities for msrs 
ownership of msrs exposes the company to impairment of the value of msrs in certain interest rate environments 
the incidence of prepayment of a mortgage loan generally increases during periods of declining interest rates as the homeowner seeks to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate 
if the level of prepayment on segments of the company s mortgage servicing portfolio achieves a level higher than projected by the company for an extended period of time  then impairment in the associated basis in the msrs may occur 
sources of funds 
deposits  short term and long term borrowings  including junior subordinated notes owed to unconsolidated subsidiaries  loan and investment security repayments and proceeds from the sale of securities  and cash flows generated from operations are the primary sources of our funds for lending  investing  and other general purposes 
loan repayments are a relatively predictable source of funds except during periods of significant interest rate declines  while deposit flows tend to fluctuate with prevailing interests rates  money markets conditions  general economic conditions and competition 
deposits 
united western bank offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
the bank s core deposits consist of retail and institutional checking accounts  now accounts  money market accounts  and retail savings accounts and certificates of deposit 
these deposits  along with brokered deposits  and short term and long term borrowings  are used to support our asset base 
retail deposits are obtained predominantly from the geographic trade areas surrounding our regional office locations 
institutional deposits are obtained nationally 
the bank relies primarily on customer service and relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits  however  market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
united western bank will focus on generating traditional deposits from its expansion of community banking services through the opening of branch locations along the colorado front range and selected mountain communities

depositor s funds are broken into amounts below fdic insurance limits and placed with other banks that are members of the cdars network 
each member bank issues certificate accounts in denominations below the fdic insured limit  resulting in full fdic insurance for the entire deposit 
for regulatory reporting purposes  cdars are considered brokered deposits 
however  for financial reporting purposes  as these deposits were generated by local customers through our banking offices  we consider these part of our community banking deposits

the rights distribution was made on november   payable to shareholders of record on that date 
the rights will expire on november  liquidity liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure  its ability to liquidate assets  and its access to alternative sources of funds 
the company seeks to ensure its funding needs are met by maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management 
bank liquidity 
liquidity management is monitored by an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of members of management and the board of directors of united western bank  which reviews historical funding requirements  current liquidity position  sources and stability of funding  marketability of assets  options for attracting additional funds  and anticipated future funding needs  including the level of unfunded commitments 
our primary sources of funds are retail  commercial and institutional deposits  advances from fhlbank and other borrowings and funds generated from operations 
funds from operations include principal and interest payments received on loans and securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities provide an indication of the timing of the receipt of funds  changes in interest rates  economic conditions and competition strongly influence mortgage prepayment rates and deposit flows  reducing the predictability of the timing on sources of funds 
united western bank has an internal policy that requires certain liquidity ratios to be met 
our current policy requires that we maintain a set amount of liquidity on the balance sheet at all times and that we have off balance sheet liquidity readily available to the bank to meet the day to day liquidity requirements of the bank and its customers

although no assurance can be given  we expect that the bank will retain a substantial majority of retail certificates of deposit and that we may allow the brokered deposits to mature without renewal 
company liquidity 
our main sources of liquidity at the holding company level are existing cash and notes receivable  dividends and tax payments from our subsidiaries and a line of credit maintained with a large money center correspondent bank in the total amount of million 
as of december   we had million drawn on this facility 
company cash on deposit at the bank at december   was million and there was approximately million of available cash for dividend to the company from non core subsidiaries 
the company is reliant on dividend and tax payments from its subsidiaries in order to fund operations  meet debt and tax obligations and grow new or developing lines of business 
a long term inability of a subsidiary to make dividend payments could significantly impact the company s liquidity 
historically  united western bank has made the majority of the dividend payments received by the company 
as a result of the liquidity generated from disposal of non core subsidiaries  united western bank did not pay a dividend to the company in the period ended december  for the year ended december   the company received dividends from matrix bancorp trading of million  uw asset corp 
of million and united western bank of million 
for the year ended december  the company received dividends of million  of which million was from the bank   was from sterling  and the balance  million  was from non core subsidiaries 
for the company anticipates dividends from sterling  and dividends from non core subsidiaries of approximately million to million 
currently  management expects the bank to pay dividends of approximately to of its income for the second half of if dividends and tax payments from subsidiaries are not sufficient to fund the cash requirements of the company  the company intends to utilize the remaining revolving credit facility and to consider various other alternative sources of financing  as needed  to meet its own and the other subsidiaries financial obligations

in the normal course of business  the company enters into various transactions  which in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  are not included in its consolidated balance sheets 
the company enters into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which involve  elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
the company also holds certain assets that are not included in its consolidated balance sheets including the custodial assets held by sterling on behalf of its customers 
commitments to extend credit 
the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit  generally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of the company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards  which are determined at the time the company enters into the commitment 
the million decrease in commitments to extend credit is principally associated with construction and development commitments  and was based on management s view of construction and development prospects in the near term 
such commitments are not necessarily an indication of future growth of such lending  since these loans have shorter life spans and generally turn over more rapidly than other forms of lending 
standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
standby letters of credit generally are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party

impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap presently requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in management s opinion  our financial condition is affected much more by changes in interest rates than by changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are certainly influenced by inflation rates  interest rates do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same proportion as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the control of the company  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things 
see item business regulation and supervision in this report 
critical accounting policies the company and its subsidiaries have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation and presentation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note of the financial statements and along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 

table of contents allowance for credit losses 
the company currently views the determination of the allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting policy that requires significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for credit losses is management s estimate of probable incurred credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolios 
management takes into consideration various factors  such as the fair value of the underlying collateral and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  the collective experience of our credit risk management team and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the allowance for credit losses consists of four components pools of homogeneous single family loans with similar risk characteristics  pools of homogenous community bank loans with similar risk characteristics ie  multifamily  residential and commercial construction and development  commercial real estate and commercial  individually significant loans that are measured for impairment  and a component representing an estimate of inherent  but probable undetected losses  which also contemplates the imprecision in the various credit risk models utilized to calculate the other components of the allowance 
pools of homogeneous single family loans with similar risk characteristics are assessed for probable losses based on loss migration analysis where loss factors are updated regularly based on actual experience 
the loss migration analysis examines historical loss experience and the related internal gradings of loans charged off 
the analysis also considers inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio 
pools of homogeneous community bank loans with similar risk characteristics ie  multifamily  residential and commercial construction and development  commercial real estate and commercial are likewise assessed for probable losses based on loss migration analysis  where loss factors are updated regularly based on our own loss experience as well as the collective experience of our credit risk management team  loss rates at selected peer community banks and industry data 
the analysis for community bank loans also incorporates the related internal gradings of loans charged off and other factors including our asset quality trends and national and local economic conditions 
the portion of the allowance established for loans measured for impairment reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific allocations for individual loans 
we consider a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
estimated fair value is typically measured using the fair value of collateral  as such loans are usually collateral dependent  but may be measured using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted using loan rate  or the market price of the loan 
all loans considered impaired are included in nonperforming loans 
we generally evaluate our residential loans collectively due to their homogeneous nature 
the last component of the allowance for credit losses is a portion which represents the estimated inherent but undetected probable losses  and the imprecision in the credit risk models utilized to calculate the allowance 
this component of the allowance is primarily associated with community bank loans and is reflective of the uncertainty related to the recent growth in the community bank loan portfolio  general economic conditions and ongoing uncertainty with respect to a small number of individually large loans 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when the loan is considered uncollectible 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for credit losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or our financial position in future periods 
valuation loans held for sale 
the company also considers its lower of cost or market locom valuations which apply to loans held for sale to be a critical accounting policy that requires use of judgments  assumptions and estimates 
the company classified million of loan assets as held for sale at december  the majority of these loans consist of single family residential loans of approximately million  sba originated loans of million  and multifamily loans of million 
loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
many of the loans owned by the company either do not trade in an active market or trade in inefficient markets 
as such  the market value of loans without available market prices is estimated by loan type using interest rates for reasonably comparable assets found in the secondary marketplace 
other factors including delinquency  existence of government guarantees  and other economic factors are considered in estimating the fair value of loans held for sale 
management has compared its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and based on that comparison believes the fair values and related assumptions are comparable to those used by other market participants 
a rising interest rate environment may possibly result in declines in the market value of the loans held for sale  which may adversely affect earnings or our financial position in future periods 
the company mitigates risk associated with declines in the estimated fair value of its loans held for sale by predominately holding loans with variable interest rates that tend to be less market sensitive to interest rate fluctuations than long term fixed rate loans

table of contents temporary vs 
other than temporary impairment 
the company views the determination of whether an investment security is temporarily or other than temporarily impaired as a critical accounting policy  as the estimate is susceptible to significant change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments  assumptions and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we assess individual securities in our investment securities portfolio for impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant 
an investment is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its carrying value at the financial statement date 
when a security is impaired  we then determine whether this impairment is temporary or other than temporary 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers  among other things  i the severity and duration of the impairment  ii the ratings of the security  iii the overall transaction structure  eg  the company s position within the structure  the aggregate  near term financial performance of the underlying collateral  delinquencies  defaults  loss severities  recoveries  prepayments  cumulative loss projections  discounted cash flows  and iv the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
management considers whether an investment security is within the scope of emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets  and eitf amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 
at the time of purchase by review of the rating assigned 
to date  all securities acquired by the company have been agency securities or had an assigned rating of aa or higher at the time of acquisition and thus such securities were excluded from the scope of eitf management considers whether an investment security is other than temporarily impaired under the guidance promulgated in final fasb staff position sfas and sfas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments and the guidance from the securities and exchange commission found in staff accounting bulletin topic m 
if impairment is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the amortized cost basis to fair value in accordance with that guidance 
we believe that current macroeconomic conditions have significantly impacted the fair value of the company s securities portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio contains several securities that have a severe decline in fair value in comparison to the amortized cost 
certain securities have been downgraded since acquisition by one or more of the nationally recognized ratings agencies 
however  the company s independently prepared cash flow forecasts support management s conclusions that it is probable the company will fully recover the amortized cost of the securities based upon assumptions that would be used by other market participants 
management s conclusion that impairment is temporary is based upon several factors 
those factors include credit rating  duration  severity of impairment  management s intent and ability to hold to recovery or maturity based upon the classification of the security  and independent analyses of the residential mortgages underlying such securities among others 
these factors in certain circumstances involve significant management estimates  and support management s conclusions that impairments are temporary 
in circumstances where these factors lead to a conclusion that impairment is other than temporary  the security is written down through a charge to earnings to its estimated fair value

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and other relevant market rates and prices 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows  and future earnings 
due to the nature of its operations  the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent liquidity risk 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk on the company s balance sheet consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options  interest rate options  and options we embed in various instruments such as fhlbank borrowings and repurchase agreements 
these options allow customers or the holders opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the company 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of the profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk principally impacts the company through certain wholesale liabilities that are tied to libor  while the majority of the community bank loans are tied to prime 
asset liability management 
united western bank has established an asset liability committee alco 
through alco  the company seeks to avoid excessive fluctuations in its net interest margin and to maximize its net interest income before provision for credit losses within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
accordingly  the company s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by alco  which oversees the risk management and establishes risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
the company utilizes an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates 
the model quantifies the effect of various interest rate alternatives on projected net interest income and net income over the next months 
the model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case alternative of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next months 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth  continued community bank conversion  changes in liability mix  and pricing 
the impact of interest rate derivatives  such as embedded options contained in certain liabilities is also included in the model 
other interest rate related risk such as prepayment  basis and option risk are also considered 

table of contents alco regularly monitors and manages the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels 
in order to meet this objective  management may lengthen or shorten the duration of assets or liabilities or enter into derivative contracts  either directly or embedded in other financial instruments  to mitigate potential market risk 
based on simulation modeling  which assumes immediate parallel changes in interest rates at december   we believe that our net interest income and net income would change over a one year period due to changes in interest rates as follows immediate shifts change in net interest income changes in levels of interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points dollars in thousands based on simulation modeling  which assumes immediate parallel changes in interest rates at december   we believe that our net interest income and net income would change over a one year period due to changes in interest rates as follows immediate shifts change in net interest income changes in levels of interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points dollars in thousands overall  management believes the company is modestly asset sensitive 
although interest rates declined rather significantly throughout  the company did increase its net interest income before provision for credit losses to million for compared to million for  and million for this increase was principally attributable to the community bank transformation that has occurred over this period 
the company s net interest margin for all of was 
the company s net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  which reflects a modest decline from the third quarter of and from the average net interest margin for the entire year 
this is consistent with our modest asset sensitive position 
the assumptions used in all of our interest rate sensitivity simulations discussed above are inherently uncertain 
as a result  the simulations cannot precisely measure net interest income or net income or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and net income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies
