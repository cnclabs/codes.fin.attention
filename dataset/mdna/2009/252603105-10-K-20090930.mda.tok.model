item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we are a branded food company specializing in processing  marketing and distributing culinary  in shell and ingredient nuts and snack products 
our company was founded in and has a strong heritage in the in shell and culinary markets under the diamond of california brand 
on july  we converted from an agricultural cooperative association to a delaware corporation and completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
as a public company  our focus is on building stockholder value 
we intend to expand our existing business and to continue introducing higher value  branded products in our culinary and snack product lines  including snack products marketed under our emerald and pop secret brand names 
our products are sold in over  retail locations in the united states and in over countries 
we sell products to approximately  customers  including over international customers 
in general  we sell directly to retailers  particularly large national grocery store and drug store chains  and indirectly through wholesale distributors to independent and small regional retail grocery store chains and convenience stores 
we also sell our products to mass merchandisers  club stores  convenience stores and through other retail channels 
our business is seasonal 
for example  in and  we recognized and of our net sales for the full fiscal year in the first six months of the year 
demand for nut products  particularly in shell nuts and to a lesser extent  culinary nuts  is highest during the months of october  november and december 
we receive our principal raw material  walnuts  during the period from september to november and process it throughout the year 
as a result of this seasonality  our personnel and working capital requirements and walnut inventories peak during the last quarter of the calendar year 
this seasonality also impacts capacity utilization at our facilities  which routinely operate at capacity for the last four months of the calendar year 
generally  we receive and pay for approximately of the corn for popcorn in december  and the remaining in may 
accordingly  the working capital requirement of popcorn is less seasonal than that of the tree nut product lines 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we 
table of contents believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer based upon terms of shipment  price is fixed  delivery occurs and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of rebates  introductory or slotting payments  coupons  promotion and marketing allowances 
customers have the right to return certain products 
product returns are estimated based upon historical results and are reflected as a reduction in net sales 
inventories 
all inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost first in  first out or market basis 
we have entered into long term walnut purchase agreements with growers  under which they deliver their entire walnut crop to us during the fall harvest season and we determine the purchase price for this inventory by march  or later  of the following year 
this purchase price will be a price determined by us in good faith  taking into account market conditions  crop size  quality  and nut varieties  among other relevant factors 
for the crop received in  we determined a minimum purchase price for this inventory on march  and made the final payment in august since the ultimate price to be paid will be determined each march  or later  subsequent to receiving the walnut crop  we must make an estimate of this price for interim financial statements 
those estimates may subsequently change and the effect of the change could be significant 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or more often if there are indications of possible impairment 
the analysis to determine whether or not an asset is impaired requires significant judgments that are dependent on internal forecasts  including estimated future cash flows  estimates of long term growth rates for our business  the expected life over which cash flows will be realized  and assumed royalty and discount rates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and any impairment charge 
while the fair value of these assets exceeds their carrying value based on our current estimates and assumptions  materially different estimates and assumptions in the future in response to changing economic conditions  changes in our business or for other reasons could result in the recognition of impairment losses 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
significant management judgment is required in this process 
we test our brand intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing brand intangibles for impairment  we compare the fair value with the carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  using inputs such as forecasted future revenues attributable to the brand  assumed royalty rates  and a risk adjusted discount rate that approximates our estimated cost of capital 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  the brand intangible asset is considered impaired  and an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the brand intangible asset 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test required by sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of each year 
in testing goodwill for impairment  we initially compare the fair value of the company s single reporting unit with the net book value of the company since it represents the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we have one operating and reportable segment 
if fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  we perform an additional step to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by first allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities and then computing the excess of the reporting units fair value over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  the excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
accordingly  we would recognize an impairment loss in the amount of such excess 
our impairment assessment employs present value techniques and 
table of contents involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including a projection of future revenues  gross margins  operating costs and cash flows  as well as general economic and market conditions and the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we also consider the estimated fair value of our reporting unit in relation to the company s market capitalization 
we can not guarantee that a material impairment charge will not be recorded in the future 
employee benefits 
we incur various employment related benefit costs with respect to qualified and nonqualified pension and deferred compensation plans 
assumptions are made related to discount rates used to value certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets in the plans  compensation increases  employee turnover and mortality rates 
different assumptions could result in the recognition of differing amounts of expense over different periods of time 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities at current tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on both our historical and anticipated earnings levels and is reviewed periodically to determine if any additional valuation allowance is necessary when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
effective august   we adopted the provisions of fin no 
which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
upon adoption  we recorded a non current liability of million and a non current deferred tax asset for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock option grants and restricted stock awards  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility  and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
results of operations compared to net sales were million and million for the years ended july  and the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased snack sales  including sales related to our acquisition of pop secret in september  offset in part by lower pricing realized for certain culinary and ingredient products

off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
effects of inflation the most significant inflationary factor affecting our net sales and cost of sales is the change in market prices for purchased nuts  corn  oils and other ingredients 
the prices of these commodities are affected by world market conditions and are volatile in response to supply and demand  as well as political and economic events 
the price fluctuations of these commodities do not necessarily 
table of contents correlate with the general inflation rate 
inflation is likely to however  adversely affect operating costs such as labor  energy and materials

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices and interest rates on borrowings 
although we have international sales and related trade receivables from foreign customers  we do not have any significant foreign currency exchange risk as substantially all sales are denominated in us dollars 
commodities risk 
the availability  size  quality  and cost of raw materials for the production of our products  including walnuts  pecans  peanuts  cashews  almonds  other nuts  corn and oils are subject to risks inherent to farming  such as crop size and yield fluctuations caused by poor weather and growing conditions  pest and disease problems  and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our supply of raw materials could be reduced if governmental agencies conclude that our products have been tampered with  or that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
interest rate risk 
we have established a formal investment policy to help minimize the exposure to our cash equivalents for changes in interest rates  which are primarily affected by credit quality and the type of cash equivalents we hold 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal 
our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
with such a short maturity  our portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
the sensitivity of our cash and cash equivalent portfolio as of july  to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would be an increase of pretax income of approximately million or a decrease of pretax income of approximately million  respectively 

table of contents interest rate volatility could also materially affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  as well as the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver 
the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver are dependent on the libor
