item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview our business is organized into three segments small business services  financial services and direct checks 
our small business services segment generated of our consolidated revenue for this segment has sold business checks  printed forms  promotional products  web services  marketing materials and related services and products to more than six million small businesses and home offices in the past five years through direct response marketing  financial institution referrals  independent distributors  the internet and sales representatives 
of the more than six million customers we have served in the past five years  nearly four million have ordered our products or services in the last months 
our financial services segment generated of our consolidated revenue for this segment sells personal and business checks  check related products and services  customer loyalty  retention and fraud monitoring and protection services  and stored value gift cards to approximately  financial institution clients nationwide  including banks  credit unions and financial services companies

com brand names 
through these brands  we sell personal and business checks and related products and services directly to consumers using direct response marketing and the internet 
we operate primarily in the united states 
small business services also has operations in canada and europe 
our business was negatively impacted in by the effects of a severe downturn in the economy and by the continued turmoil in the financial services sector 
we have experienced a reduction in demand for many of our products in small business services  and check orders from several of our financial institutions have been lower due to uncertainty related to government bailouts and consolidations 
at the same time  we have accelerated many of our cost reduction actions and have identified new opportunities to improve our operating cost structure 
in addition  we have continued to invest in our transformation with acquisitions that bring higher growth business service offerings into our portfolio 
we are focused on capitalizing on these transformational opportunities available to us in this difficult environment and believe that we will be better positioned to deliver increasingly better margins once the economy begins to recover 
our net income for  as compared to  benefited from the following various management initiatives to reduce our cost structure  primarily within sales and marketing  information technology and manufacturing  a significant reduction in employee related costs  primarily performance based employee compensation  and higher revenue per order in direct checks  primarily from price increases and increased sales of fraud protection services 
these benefits were more than offset by the following lower volume driven by unfavorable economic conditions  primarily affecting small business services  and the continuing decline in check usage and advertising response rates  as well as non recurring financial institution conversion activity in  restructuring charges and related costs in resulting from our cost reduction initiatives  impairment charges in related to small business services trade names and discontinued operations  increased manufacturing costs  including higher delivery related costs due to mid and postal rate increases and fuel surcharges in  as well as higher materials costs due to an unfavorable product mix  and lower revenue per order in financial services  despite a price increase in october  due to this segment s competitive pricing environment 
our strategies small business services our focus within small business services is to grow revenue and increase operating margin by continuing to implement the following strategies acquire new customers by leveraging customer referrals that we receive from our financial institution clients and from other marketing initiatives such as e commerce and direct mail  increase our share of the amount small businesses spend on the products and services in our portfolio  expand in higher growth areas such as full color  web to print  imaging and business services  including payroll  fraud protection  web hosting and other web services  business networking and logo design  and continue to optimize our cost and expense structure 
we are continuing to invest in several key enablers to achieve our strategies and reposition small business services as not just a provider of printed products  but also a provider of higher growth business services 
these key enablers include continuing to improve our e commerce capabilities  implementing an integrated platform for our various brands  improving our customer analytics  focusing on key customer segments and improving our merchandising 
we have refreshed our existing product offerings and have already improved some of our newer service offerings  which we believe creates a more valuable suite of products and services 
we have acquired companies which allow us to expand our custom  full color  digital and web to print offerings  as well as web hosting and other web services  logo design and business networking services 
we expect to drive growth as we obtain a greater portion of our revenue from higher growth annuity based business services 
in august  we completed the acquisition of hostopia 
com inc hostopia in a cash transaction for million  net of cash acquired 
hostopia is a provider of web services that enable small businesses to establish and maintain an internet presence 
hostopia s revenue for its fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of from its previous year amount 
hostopia also provides email marketing  fax to email  mobility synchronization and other services 
it provides a unified  scaleable  web enabled platform that better positions us to obtain orders for a wider variety of products  including checks  forms  business cards and full color  digital and web to print offerings  as well as imaging and other printed products 
hostopia operates primarily in the united states and canada 
also during  we acquired the assets of partnerup  inc partnerup  logo design mojo  inc logo mojo and yoffi digital press yoffi for an aggregate cash amount of million 
partnerup is an online community that is designed to connect small businesses and entrepreneurs with resources and contacts to build their businesses 
logo mojo is a canadian based online logo design firm and yoffi is a commercial digital printer specializing in custom marketing material 
during  we introduced the www 
shopdeluxe 
com website  our new customer facing e commerce platform 
this website  along with our www 
deluxe 
com website  will serve as a platform for improved e commerce capability 
we intend to consolidate our deluxe marketing store website into shopdeluxe 
com to further improve the customer experience  and we have identified opportunities to expand sales to our existing customers and acquire new customers 
also important to our growth are the small business customer referrals we receive from our deluxe business advantage program  which provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses 
our relationships with financial institutions are important in helping us serve customer segments more deeply  such as contractors  professional services providers and banks and credit unions 
financial services our strategies within financial services are as follows continue to maintain core check revenue streams and acquire new clients  provide services and products that differentiate us from the competition and make us a more relevant business partner to our financial institution clients by helping them grow core deposits  and continue to simplify our business model and optimize our cost and expense structure 
we proactively extended several check contracts during and will continue our focus on acquiring new clients during we are also leveraging our loyalty  retention  market intelligence and fraud monitoring and protection offers  as well as our deluxe business advantage program 
the deluxe business advantage program is designed to maximize financial institution business check programs by offering the products and services of our small business services segment to small businesses through a number of service level options 
the revenue from these additional products and services is reflected in our small business services segment 
in our efforts to expand beyond check related products  we have introduced several services and products that focus on customer loyalty and retention  as well as fraud monitoring and protection 
following are some examples deluxe id theftblock a set of fraud monitoring and recovery services that provides assistance to consumers in detecting and recovering from identity theft 
welcome home sm tool kit a start to finish package for financial institution branch offices that captures best practices for securing lasting loyalty among customers by focusing on the first days of the relationship 
deluxe calling sm an outbound calling program aimed at helping financial institutions generate new organic revenue growth and reduce attrition 
we expect providing products and services that differentiate us from the competition will help offset the decline in check usage and the pricing pressures we are experiencing in our check programs 
as such  we are also focused on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services 
in addition to these value added services  we continue to offer our knowledge exchange tm series  a suite of resources and events for our financial institution clients focused on the customer experience 
direct checks our strategies within direct checks are as follows optimize cash flow  maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features  accessories and products  and continue to lower our cost and expense structure 
we intend to optimize the cash flow generated by this segment by continuing to lower our cost and expense structure in all functional areas  particularly in the areas of marketing and fulfillment 
we will continue to actively market our products and services through targeted advertising and will focus a greater portion of our investment in the e commerce channel 
additionally  we continue to explore avenues to increase sales to existing customers 
for example  we have had success with the ezshield tm product  a check protection service that provides reimbursement to consumers for forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks 
cost reduction initiatives we are pursuing aggressive cost reduction and business simplification initiatives  including reducing shared services infrastructure costs  streamlining our call center and fulfillment activities  eliminating system and work stream redundancies  and strengthening our ability to quickly develop new products and services and bring them to market 
we believe significant cost reduction opportunities exist in the reduction of stock keeping units skus  the standardization of products and services and improvements in sourcing third party goods and services 
in addition  we closed one customer call center during the third quarter of and one printing facility in december  and we plan to close five additional printing facilities and one customer call center in these and other actions since collectively are expected to reduce our annual cost structure by at least million  net of required investments  by the end of the baseline for these anticipated savings is the annual diluted earnings per share guidance for of to  which we provided in our press release on july  regarding second quarter results 
we expect all three of our business segments to benefit from cost reductions 
we estimate that approximately of the million target will come from reorganizing our sales and marketing functions and that another of the target will come from our shared services infrastructure organizations of information technology  real estate  finance  human resources and legal 
we expect information technology will provide the greatest percentage of these savings through lowering data center costs  improving mainframe and server utilization and reducing the cost of networking and voice communications 
we also estimate that approximately of the million target will come from fulfillment  including manufacturing and supply chain 
overall  approximately one third of the savings are expected to affect cost of goods sold  with the remaining two thirds impacting selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
through december   we estimate that we have realized approximately million of our million target 
we anticipate that we will realize an additional million in and the remaining million in outlook for we anticipate that consolidated revenue from continuing operations will be between billion and billion for  as compared to billion for we expect that current economic conditions will continue to adversely affect volumes in small business services and drive a mid single to low double digit decline in revenue despite modest contributions from our e commerce initiatives and revenue from the hostopia and partnerup acquisitions 
in financial services  we expect an acceleration of check order declines to approximately six to seven percent given the turmoil in the financial services industry 
we expect the related revenue pressure to be partially offset by a price increase implemented in the fourth quarter of  as well as a modest contribution from our loyalty  retention  monitoring and protection offers 
we expect the revenue decline in direct checks to be in the double digits  driven by the decline in check usage and the weak economy which is negatively impacting our ability to sell additional products 
the upper end of our outlook assumes the current economic trends do not improve throughout the year and that we benefit only a modest amount from our revenue growth initiatives 
the lower end of our outlook assumes a further deterioration in the economy throughout the year 
we expect that diluted earnings per share will be between and  which includes an estimated per share for restructuring activities  compared to for we expect that continued progress with our cost reduction initiatives  as well as the impact of restructuring and asset impairment charges in  will be partially offset by the revenue decline  as well as an estimated million increase in performance based employee compensation  an estimated million increase in material and delivery costs and an estimated million increase in employee and retiree medical expenses 
our outlook also reflects a wage freeze in which avoids an million increase in our expense structure 
we estimate that our annual effective tax rate for will be approximately  compared to in we anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations will be between million and million in  compared to million in we anticipate that lower performance based compensation payments in  as well as working capital improvements  will be partially offset by increased restructuring related payments 
we estimate that capital spending will be approximately million in as we plan to expand our use of digital printing technology and invest in manufacturing productivity and revenue growth initiatives 
we funded our acquisitions in through cash and borrowings on our credit facilities 
additionally  we repurchased million of common stock in even with these actions  we believe that we continue to have reasonable access to capital in order to fund operations and execute our strategies in with no long term debt maturities until  we are focused on a disciplined approach to capital deployment that balances the need to continue investing in initiatives to drive revenue growth  including small acquisitions  with our focus on reducing debt 
although we have periodically repurchased shares in the recent past  our focus in will be to further reduce our debt 
we anticipate that our board of directors will maintain our current dividend level 
however  dividends are approved by our board of directors on a quarterly basis and thus  are subject to change 
business challenges market risks market for checks and business forms the market for our two largest products  checks and business forms  is very competitive 
these products are mature and their use has been declining 
according to our estimates  the total number of checks written in the united states has been in decline as a result of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines and electronic payment systems 
according to a federal reserve study released in december  approximately billion checks are written annually 
this includes checks which are converted to automated clearing house ach payments 
the check remains the largest single non cash payment method in the united states  accounting for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
this is a reduction from the federal reserve study released in december when checks accounted for approximately of all non cash payment transactions 
the federal reserve estimates that checks written declined approximately four percent per year between and according to our estimates  the use of business checks is declining at a rate of approximately four to six percent per year  although the decline  we believe  was greater in due to the economic recession and instability in the financial services industry 
the total transaction volume of all electronic payment methods exceeds check payments  and we expect that to continue 
in addition to the decline in check usage  the use of business forms is also under pressure 
continued technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  off the shelf business software applications and electronic transaction systems have been designed to replace pre printed business form products 
financial institution clients because check usage is declining and financial institutions are consolidating  we have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
our traditional financial institution relationships are typically formalized through supply contracts averaging three to five years in duration 
as we compete to retain and acquire new financial institution business  the resulting pricing pressure  combined with declining check usage in the marketplace  has reduced our revenue and profit margins 
we expect this trend to continue 
continued turmoil in the financial services industry  including further bank failures and consolidations  could have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations if any of the following were to occur we could lose a significant contract  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we may be unable to recover the value of any related unamortized contract acquisition cost and or accounts receivable 
contract acquisition costs  which are treated as pre paid product discounts  are sometimes utilized in our financial services segment when signing or renewing contracts with our financial institution clients and totaled million as of december  these amounts are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
in most situations  the contract requires a financial institution to reimburse us for the unamortized contract acquisition cost if it terminates its contract with us prior to the end of the contract term 
our contract acquisition costs are comprised of amounts paid to individual financial institutions  many of which are smaller and would not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if they were deemed unrecoverable 
however  the inability to recover amounts paid to one or more of our larger financial institution clients could have a significant negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 
if one or more of our financial institution clients is taken over by a financial institution that is not one of our clients  we could lose significant business 
in the case of a cancelled contract  we may be entitled to collect a contract termination payment 
however  if a financial institution fails  we may be unable to collect that termination payment 
we have no indication at this time that any significant contract terminations are expected 
if one or more of our larger clients were to consolidate with a financial institution that is not one of our clients  our results of operations could be positively impacted if we retain the client  as well as obtain the additional business from the other party in the consolidation 
if two of our financial institution clients consolidate  the increase in general negotiating leverage possessed by the consolidated entities sometimes results in new contracts which are not as favorable to us as those historically negotiated with the clients individually 
we could generate non recurring conversion revenue 
conversions are driven by the need to replace obsolete checks after one financial institution merges with or acquires another 
however  we presently do not have specific information that indicates that we should expect to generate significant income from conversions 
consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements direct checks and portions of small business services have been impacted by reduced consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements 
our own experience indicates that direct to consumer media response rates are declining across a wide variety of products and services 
additionally  our consumer response rates are declining further due to the decline in check usage and the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products 
economic conditions general economic conditions negatively impacted our results of operations  primarily in small business services 
the rate of small business formations and small business confidence impact small business services 
the index of small business optimism published by the national federation of independent business in december was at a near record low 
according to estimates of the small business administration s office of advocacy  new small business formations were down slightly in  the most recent date for which information is available  as compared to consumer spending and employment levels also have some impact on our personal check businesses 
both measures trended negatively during  and we did experience some negative impact in our personal check businesses 
we expect that general economic conditions will continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations 
a prolonged downturn in general economic conditions could result in additional declines in our revenue and profitability 
the effects of the recent economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader us market resulted in a significant reduction in our share price and led to asset impairment charges in related to trade names in our small business services segment 
both before and after december   our common stock traded at prices lower than the december  closing stock price of 
if such a decline in our stock price occurs in the future for a sustained period  it may be indicative of a further decline in our fair value and would likely require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of the million of goodwill allocated to one of our reporting units 
accordingly  we believe that a non cash goodwill impairment charge related to this reporting unit and or further impairment charges related to our indefinite lived trade name are reasonably possible in the future 
this reporting unit had a calculated fair value which exceeded its carrying value by million as of december  the calculated fair values of our other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by amounts between million and million 
our indefinite lived trade name had a carrying value of million as of december  the credit agreement governing our committed line of credit requires us to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense of times  as measured quarterly on an aggregate basis for the preceding four quarters 
significant impairment charges in the future could impact our ability to comply with this debt covenant  in which case  our lenders could demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
we would have remained in compliance with this debt covenant even if our reported pre tax earnings for had been million lower than we reported 
for further information regarding the impairment analyses completed during  see the goodwill and indefinite lived assets discussion under application of critical accounting policies 
postretirement and pension plans the plan assets of our postretirement benefit and pension plans are valued at fair value using quoted market prices 
investments  in general  are subject to various risks  including credit  interest and overall market volatility risks 
during  the equity markets saw a significant decline in value 
as such  the fair values of our plan assets decreased significantly during the year 
our plan assets and liabilities were re measured at december   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the unfunded status of our plans increased by million from december   due in large part to the decrease in the fair values of plan assets 
this affected the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  it also contributes to an expected increase in postretirement benefit expense of approximately million in if the equity and bond markets continue to decline  the funded status of our plans could continue to be materially affected 
this could result in higher postretirement benefit expense in the future  as well as the need to contribute increased amounts of cash to fund the benefits payable under the plans  although our obligation is limited to funding benefits as they become payable 
deferred compensation plan we have a non qualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation 
the compensation deferred under this plan is credited with earnings or losses measured by the mirrored rate of return on phantom investments elected by plan participants  which are similar to the investments available in our defined contribution pension plan 
as such  our liability for this plan fluctuates with market conditions 
during  we reduced our deferred compensation liability by million due to losses on the underlying investments elected by plan participants 
the carrying value of this liability  which was million as of december   may change significantly in future periods if volatility in the equity markets continues 
consolidated results of operations during the fourth quarter of  our russell miller retail packaging and signage business met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
as such  our results for prior years reflect the reclassification of the results of this business to discontinued operations  and the discussion that follows pertains only to our continuing operations 
consolidated revenue change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except per order amounts revenue orders revenue per order the decrease in revenue for  as compared to  was due to unfavorable economic conditions  primarily affecting small business services  as well as lower volume for direct checks due to the overall decline in check usage and advertising response rates  lower order volume for financial services due to the decline in check usage and non recurring client conversion activity in  and lower revenue per order for financial services 
conversion activity is driven by the need to replace obsolete checks after one financial institution merges with or acquires another 
revenue in benefited from higher non recurring canadian check sales due to the introduction of a new check format required by the canadian payments association 
partially offsetting these revenue decreases was revenue of million from the small business services acquisitions completed in  as discussed under executive overview  higher revenue per order for direct checks due to price increases and increased sales of fraud protection services  as well as the benefit of financial services price increases in february and october sales of fraud protection services also increased within small business services 
the number of orders decreased for  as compared to  due to the volume declines for direct checks and financial services discussed earlier  as well as the unfavorable economic conditions primarily affecting small business services 
partially offsetting these volume decreases was the small business services acquisitions completed in the decline in orders  excluding the acquisitions  was for  as compared to revenue per order decreased for  as compared to  primarily due to continued pricing pressure within financial services  partially offset by the benefit of direct checks and financial services price increases 
also impacting revenue per order were the small business services acquisitions completed in the acquisitions reduced revenue per order by percentage points for primarily because hostopia s revenue per order is lower as each monthly billing generated for service fees is considered to be an order 
the decrease in revenue for  as compared to  was primarily due to a million decrease resulting from the sale of our industrial packaging product line in january  as well as a decline in volume for our direct checks segment and lower revenue per order due to lower pricing in our financial services segment 
lower volume for direct checks was primarily due to the overall decline in check usage  as well as lower customer retention and lower direct mail consumer response rates 
small business services also experienced a slight revenue decrease in the last half of the year related to general economic conditions 
partially offsetting these decreases were revenues of approximately million generated by the johnson group  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of  and higher revenue per order for direct checks due to the introduction of new products and services  including the ezshield product discussed earlier under executive overview 
additionally  financial services volume increased due to client gains and financial institution conversion activity  and revenue in canada increased due to a favorable exchange rate impact of approximately million  plus increased check orders triggered by a new check format mandated by the canadian payments association 
the number of orders increased slightly for  as compared to  as the financial services volume increase of exceeded the negative impacts of direct checks volume decline  the sale of small business services industrial packaging product line and the negative economic impact experienced by small business services in the last half of the year 
revenue per order decreased for  as compared to  as lower prices in financial services more than offset the impact of increases in revenue per order for direct checks and small business services

vs 
in thousands gross profit gross margin pt 
pt 
gross margin decreased for  as compared to  due primarily to a million increase in restructuring charges and other costs related to our cost reduction initiatives 
further information regarding our restructuring costs can be found under restructuring costs 
the restructuring charges and other related costs lowered our gross margin for by percentage points 
additionally  higher delivery related costs from mid and postal rate increases and fuel surcharges in  higher materials costs due to an unfavorable product mix  as well as competitive pricing in financial services negatively affected gross margin 
these decreases were partially offset by price increases for direct checks and financial services  as well as manufacturing efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our cost reduction initiatives 
gross margin increased for  as compared to  due to manufacturing efficiencies  including the closing of two small business services manufacturing facilities in mid  as well as lower material costs in related to a higher mix of check products in small business services 
additionally  we benefited from increased financial services order volume in and a million decrease in restructuring costs in further information regarding our restructuring costs can be found under restructuring costs 
partially offsetting these gross margin increases was lower financial services revenue per order  a postal rate increase in mid and costs associated with the implementation of new check packaging intended to mitigate the effects of the postal rate increase 
consolidated selling  general administrative expense change vs 
vs 
in thousands sg a expense sg a expense as a percentage of revenue pt 
pt 
the decrease in sg a expense for  as compared to  was primarily due to various cost reduction initiatives within our shared services organizations  primarily within sales and marketing and information technology  a reduction of approximately million in performance based employee compensation and lower employee benefit costs related to reduced workers compensation and medical claims activity 
these decreases in sg a expense were partially offset by investments to drive revenue growth opportunities  including marketing costs within small business services and information technology investments 
the decrease in sg a expense for  as compared to  was due to various cost reduction initiatives within our shared services organizations  lower amortization expense and project costs of approximately million related to a software project we wrote off in the second quarter of  and investments made in related to implementing our small business services growth strategies 
we also benefited from lower amortization of acquisition related intangible assets within small business services of million  as certain of these assets are amortized using accelerated methods 
partially offsetting these sg a decreases was an increase in expense for performance based employee compensation based on our operating performance of approximately million  a gain in of million from the termination of an underperforming outsourced payroll services contract and higher referral commissions for small business services resulting from growth in our deluxe business advantage financial institution referral program

net restructuring reversals of million were included within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income

asset impairment charges change vs 
vs 
in thousands asset impairment charges we completed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived assets during the third quarter of as a result of this analysis  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million related to the two indefinite lived trade names in our small business services segment due to the impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader effects of recent us market conditions on the fair value of the assets 
we completed an additional impairment analysis as of december   based on the continuing impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
as a result  we recorded an additional asset impairment charge of million related to the nebs trade name during the fourth quarter of  bringing the carrying value of this asset to million as of december  the impairment analysis completed as of december   indicated no additional impairment of our other indefinite lived trade name  the safeguard trade name  which had a carrying value of million as of december  because of the further deterioration in our expected operating results  we determined that the nebs trade name no longer has an indefinite life  and thus  will be amortized over its estimated economic life of years on the straight line basis beginning in the analysis indicated no impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the impairment of indefinite lived trade names  we also recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of related to an amortizable trade name 
this impairment resulted from a change in our branding strategy 
see business challenges market risks for further discussion of asset impairments 
in june  we determined that a software project intended to replace major portions of our existing order capture  billing and pricing systems would not meet our future business requirements in a cost effective manner 
therefore  we made the decision to abandon the project 
accordingly  we wrote down the carrying value of the related internal use software to zero during the second quarter of this resulted in a non cash asset impairment charge of million  of which million was allocated to the financial services segment and million was allocated to the small business services segment

during  we completed the sale of our small business services industrial packaging product line for million  realizing a pre tax gain of million 
this sale had an insignificant impact on our earnings per share because of an offsetting income tax effect 
during  we completed the sale of three financial services facilities which were closed in  realizing a pre tax gain totaling million

interest expense decreased in  as compared to  for the same reasons 
other income change vs 
vs 
in thousands other income the decrease in other income for  as compared to  was primarily due to interest earned in on investments in marketable securities which were purchased using the proceeds from million of notes we issued in may these investments were sold in october to repay long term debt 
the increase in other income for  as compared to  was primarily due to the interest earned on the marketable securities we purchased during income tax provision change vs 
vs 
in thousands income tax provision effective tax rate pt 
pt 
our effective tax rate for was comparable to favorable discrete adjustments in lowered our effective tax rate percentage points 
the discrete adjustments related primarily to receivables for amendments to prior year tax returns of million and the settlement of million due to us under a tax sharing agreement related to the spin off of our efunds business in  partially offset by accruals for unrecognized tax benefits 
our effective tax rate included favorable discrete adjustments which lowered our effective tax rate points 
the discrete adjustments related to receivables for amendments to prior year tax returns of million  partially offset by the write off of non deductible goodwill related to the sale of our industrial packaging product line 
partially offsetting the favorable impact of discrete adjustments in  as compared to  was the impact of restructuring costs and asset impairment charges in and interest earned on tax exempt investments in we expect that our annual effective tax rate for will be approximately  up slightly due to higher state taxes and the negative impact on our manufacturing deduction of restructuring costs to be paid in the increase in our effective tax rate for  as compared to  was largely due to a million reduction in our income tax provision for the true up of certain deferred income tax balances 
as this item was not material to our current or prior periods  we recorded a one time  discrete benefit to our provision for income taxes for in addition  our state income tax rate was higher in  and the lower pre tax income in resulted in our permanent differences having a larger positive impact on the effective tax rate 
also  the write off of non deductible goodwill related to the sale of our industrial packaging product line in unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate 
partially offsetting these increases in our effective tax rate in  as compared to  was the impact of positive adjustments in related to receivables for amendments to prior year tax returns of million 
restructuring costs during  we recorded net restructuring charges of million 
of this amount  million related to accruals for employee severance  while the remainder included other expenses related to our restructuring activities  including the write off of spare parts  the acceleration of employee share based compensation expense  equipment moves  training and travel 
our restructuring accruals for severance benefits related to the closing of six manufacturing facilities and two customer call centers  as well as employee reductions within our business unit support and corporate shared services functions  primarily sales  marketing and fulfillment 
these actions were the result of the continuous review of our cost structure in response to the impact a weakened us economy continues to have on our business  as well as our previously announced cost reduction initiatives 
further information regarding our cost reduction initiatives can be found under executive overview 
the restructuring accruals included severance benefits for  employees 
one of the customer call centers was closed during the third quarter of and one of the manufacturing facilities was closed in december three of the manufacturing facilities and the remaining call center are expected to close in the first half  while the remaining two manufacturing facilities are expected to close in the second half of the majority of the employee reductions are expected to be completed by the end of as such  we expect most of the related severance payments to be fully paid by the first half of  utilizing cash from operations 
the severance charges  net of reversals  were reflected as restructuring charges within cost of goods sold of million and restructuring charges within operating expenses of million in the consolidated statement of income 
the other costs related to our restructuring activities were expensed as incurred 
we recorded a million write off of the carrying value of spare parts used on our offset printing presses 
during a review of our cost structure  we made the decision to expand our use of the digital printing process

contract acquisition costs other non current assets include contract acquisition costs of our financial services segment 
these costs  which are essentially pre paid product discounts  are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
cash payments made for contract acquisition costs were million in  million in and million in  and we anticipate cash payments of approximately million in changes in contract acquisition costs during the last three years were as follows in thousands balance  beginning of year additions amortization balance  end of year the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or acquire clients 
both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments increased in the mid s  and has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid depends on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  competitors actions  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
these costs impact the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made rather than providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
beginning in  we sought to reduce the use of up front product discounts by structuring new contracts with incentives throughout the duration of the contract 
we plan to continue this strategy 
see business challenges market risks for discussion of the recoverability of contract acquisition costs 
liabilities for contract acquisition payments are recorded upon contract execution 
these obligations are monitored for each contract and are adjusted as payments are made

in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as product or service defects  including breach of security  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of terms of the contract 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including  for example  unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that any likely liability under these indemnities would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  annual results of operations or annual cash flows 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications related to environmental matters

these purchase orders are not included in the purchase obligations presented here  as our business partners typically allow us to cancel these purchase orders as necessary to accommodate business needs

if we were to terminate these agreements  we would have incurred early termination fees of million as of december  other long term liabilities consist primarily of amounts due for our postretirement benefit plans and liabilities for uncertain tax positions  deferred compensation and workers compensation 
of the million reported as other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   million is excluded from the obligations shown in the table above 
the excluded amounts  including the current portion of each liability  are comprised primarily of the following benefit payments for postretirement benefit plans we have contributed funds to these plans for the purpose of funding our obligations 
thus  we have the option of paying benefits from the assets of the plans or from the general funds of the company 
additionally  we expect the plan assets to earn income over time 
as such  we cannot predict when or if payments from the general funds of the company will be required 
as of december   our postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by a total of million 
payments for uncertain tax positions due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities

a portion of the amount due under our deferred compensation plan under this plan  some employees may begin receiving payments upon the termination of employment or disability  and we cannot predict when these events will occur 
as such  million of our deferred compensation liability as of december  is excluded from the obligations shown in the table above 
insured environmental remediation costs as of december   million of the costs included in our environmental accruals are covered by an environmental insurance policy which we purchased in the insurance policy does not cover properties acquired subsequent to the insurance policy covers pre existing conditions from third party claims and cost overruns through at certain owned  leased and divested sites  as well as any new conditions discovered at certain owned or leased sites through as a result  we expect to receive reimbursements from the insurance company for environmental remediation costs we incur for these insured sites

total contractual obligations do not include the following payments to our defined contribution pension and k plans the amounts payable under our defined contribution pension and k plans are dependent on the number of employees providing services throughout the year  their wage rates and in the case of the k plans  whether employees elect to participate in the plans

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
our accounting policies are discussed under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
application of critical accounting policies we consider the estimates discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they place the most significant demands on management s judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and the impact of different estimates or assumptions could be material to our consolidated financial statements

goodwill and indefinite lived assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july  or more frequently if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
we completed an additional impairment analysis as of december  due to the continuing impacts of the economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader effects of recent us market conditions on the fair value of the assets 
in addition to the required impairment analyses  we continually evaluate the remaining useful lives of our indefinite lived assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we determine that one of these assets has a finite useful life  we must first test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset s remaining carrying value over its estimated remaining useful life 
further information regarding the fair value measurements completed during is provided under the caption note supplementary balance sheet and cash flow information of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we completed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived assets during the third quarter of as a result of this analysis  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million related to the two indefinite lived trade names in our small business services segment due to the impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results and the broader effects of recent us market conditions on the fair value of the assets 
we completed an additional impairment analysis as of december   based on the continuing impact of the economic downturn on our expected operating results 
as a result  we recorded an additional asset impairment charge of million related to the nebs trade name during the fourth quarter of  bringing the carrying value of this asset to million as of december  the impairment analysis completed as of december   indicated no additional impairment of our other indefinite lived trade name  the safeguard trade name  which had a carrying value of million as of december  the fair value of the safeguard trade name exceeded its carrying value by million as of december  because of the further deterioration in our expected operating results  we determined that the nebs trade name no longer has an indefinite life  and thus  will be amortized over its estimated economic life of years on the straight line basis beginning in as such  this asset will no longer be subject to annual impairment testing  but will be tested for impairment in accordance with our policy on impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangibles  as outlined under the caption note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
in determining the fair value of our trade names  we utilize the relief from royalty method  which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name 
an assumed royalty rate is applied to forecasted revenue and the resulting cash flows are discounted 
as of december   we assumed a discount rate of and a royalty rate of for our evaluation of the safeguard trade name 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million and a one percentage point decrease in the royalty rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million 
as of december   we assumed a discount rate of and a royalty rate of for our evaluation of the nebs trade name 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million and a one percentage point decrease in the royalty rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million 
in addition to the impairment of indefinite lived trade names  we also recorded a million non cash impairment charge during related to an amortizable trade name due to a change in our branding strategy 
due to the ongoing uncertainty in market conditions  we will perform additional impairment analyses of our safeguard indefinite lived trade name if a decline in our expected operating results  discount rate or royalty rate is indicated 
our impairment analysis as of december  indicated no impairment of goodwill 
in completing our goodwill impairment analysis  we test the appropriateness of our reporting units estimated fair values by reconciling the aggregate reporting units fair values with our market capitalization 
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units included a control premium  which is an amount we estimate a buyer would be willing to pay in excess of the current market price of our company in order to acquire a controlling interest 
the premium is justified by the expected synergies  such as expected increases in cash flows resulting from cost savings and revenue enhancements 
due to the ongoing uncertainty in market conditions  we will perform additional impairment analyses if a decline in market value or in our expected operating results is indicated 
as of december   the calculated fair value of one of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value of million by million 
our fair value calculation was based on a closing stock price of per share at december  both before and after december   our common stock traded at prices lower than this closing price 
if such a decline in our stock price occurs in the future for a sustained period  it may be indicative of a further decline in our fair value and would likely require us to record an impairment charge for a portion of the million of goodwill allocated to this reporting unit 
accordingly  we believe that a non cash goodwill impairment charge related to this reporting unit and or further impairment charges related to our indefinite lived trade name are reasonably possible in the future 
the calculated fair values of our other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by amounts between million and million 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows and revenues over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
if these estimates and assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected taxable income  statutory tax rates and tax credits allowed in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in interim reporting periods  we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate based on the facts available at the time 
changes in the mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact our estimated effective tax rate in interim periods 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the interim period the unusual or one time item occurred 
the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
tax laws require certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense  net of the expected tax benefit  in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million as of december  and million as of december   including valuation allowances of million as of december  and million as december  the valuation allowances relate primarily to canadian operating loss carryforwards which we do not expect to realize 
on a regular basis  our income tax returns are reviewed by various domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
as such  we record accruals for items which we believe may be challenged by these taxing authorities 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities based solely on the technical merits of the position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured and recognized as the largest amount of tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  was million  excluding accrued interest and penalties 
if the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized in our consolidated financial statements  million would affect our effective tax rate 
interest and penalties recorded for uncertain tax positions are included in our income tax provision 
as of december   million of interest and penalties was accrued  excluding the tax benefits of deductible interest 
the statute of limitations for federal tax assessments for and prior years has closed  with the exception of our federal income tax returns for through remain subject to internal revenue service examination 
in general  income tax returns for the years through remain subject to examination by major state and city tax jurisdictions 
in the event that we have determined not to file tax returns with a particular state or city  all years remain subject to examination by the tax jurisdiction 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash and could result in increased income tax expense 
favorable resolution would result in reduced income tax expense 
changes in unrecognized tax benefits during and can be found under the caption note income tax provision of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
within the next months  it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will change in the range of a decrease of million to an increase of million as we attempt to settle certain federal and state matters or as federal and state statutes of limitations expire 
we are not able to predict what  if any  impact these changes may have on our effective tax rate or cash flows 
we reduced our income tax provision million in and million in for amendments to prior year tax returns claiming refunds primarily associated with the funding of medical costs through our veba trust  as well as state income tax credits and related interest 
also during  we reduced our income tax provision million for the settlement of amounts due to us under a tax sharing agreement related to the spin off of our efunds business in during  we reduced our income tax provision million for net accrual reversals related to settled issues  primarily resulting from the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various state income tax jurisdictions 
also during  we reduced our income tax provision million for the true up of certain deferred income tax balances 
as this item was not material to or prior periods  we recorded a one time  discrete benefit to our provision for income taxes for postretirement benefits detailed information regarding our postretirement benefit plan  including a description of the plan  its related future cash flows  plan assets and the actuarial assumptions used in accounting for the plan  can be found under the caption note pension and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
our net postretirement benefit expense was million for and and million for our business segments record postretirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold and sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our postretirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected health care cost trend rate and the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 
we analyze the assumptions used each year when we complete our actuarial valuation of the plan 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our postretirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods could be impacted 
discount rate the discount rate is used to reflect the time value of money 
it is the assumed rate at which future postretirement benefits could be effectively settled 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize the hewitt top quartile and the citigroup pension discount yield curves to discount each cash flow stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present value of each cash flow stream is aggregated and used to impute a weighted average discount rate 
in previous years  we also considered moody s high quality corporate bond rates when selecting our discount rate 
however  as the number of bonds included in this index fell significantly during and those bonds do not match the timing of our expected cash flows as well  we no longer utilize these rates 
the discount rate established at year end for purposes of calculating our benefit obligation is also used in the calculation of the interest component of benefit expense for the following year 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million and would increase or decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
we base this assumption on an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
in measuring net postretirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
expected health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be for participants under the age of and for participants over the age of our ultimate health care inflation rate was assumed to be in and beyond for participants under the age of and in and beyond for participants over the age of a one percentage point increase in the health care inflation rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual postretirement benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the health care inflation rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual postretirement benefit expense by million 
average remaining life expectancy of plan participants in determining the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants  our actuaries use a mortality table which includes estimated death rates for each age 
we use the rp combined healthy participant table projected to the measurement date with scale aa in determining this assumption 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
the gain or loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated balance sheet within accumulated comprehensive loss and is amortized into postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of plan participants  which is currently years 
as of december  and  our unrecognized net actuarial loss was million and million  respectively  and was comprised of the following in thousands return on plan assets claims experience health care cost trend discount rate assumption other unrecognized net actuarial loss see business challenges market risks for discussion of the risks related to our postretirement benefit plan 
restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals  as many times employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the extent our assumptions and estimates differ from our actual costs  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
we reversed previously recorded restructuring accruals of million in  million in and million in primarily as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated

we are required to apply the new guidance to business combinations completed after december  we are not able to predict the impact this guidance will have on the accounting for acquisitions we may complete in future periods 
for acquisitions completed prior to january   the new standard requires that changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period must be recognized in earnings rather than as an adjustment to the cost of the acquisition

this guidance states that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share using the two class method outlined in sfas no 
 earnings per share 
the two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
the terms of our restricted stock unit and restricted stock awards do provide a nonforfeitable right to receive dividend equivalent payments on unvested awards 
as such  these awards are considered participating securities under the new guidance 
effective january   we will begin reporting earnings per share under the two class method and will restate all historical earnings per share data 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a significant impact on reported earnings per share
