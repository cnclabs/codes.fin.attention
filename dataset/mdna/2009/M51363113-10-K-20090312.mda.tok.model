item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in the risk factors 
overview general we are a leading supplier of semiconductor based  high performance connectivity products that facilitate efficient data transmission between servers  communications infrastructure equipment and storage systems 
our products are an integral part of a total solution focused on computing  storage and communication applications used in enterprise data center  high performance computing and embedded systems 
we operate in one reportable segment the development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of interconnect semiconductor products see note segment information of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we are a fabless semiconductor company that provides high performance interconnect products based on semiconductor integrated circuits  or ics 
we design  develop and market adapter and switch ics  both of which are silicon devices that provide high performance connectivity 
we also offer adapter cards that incorporate our ics and switch systems that incorporate our switch ics 
growth in our target markets is being driven by the need to improve the efficiency and performance of clustered systems in data centers  as well as the need to significantly reduce the total cost of ownership 
we outsource our manufacturing  assembly  packaging and production test functions  which enables us to focus on the design  development  sales and marketing of our products 
as a result  our business has relatively low capital requirements 
however  our ability to bring new products to market  fulfill customer orders and achieve long term growth depends on our ability to maintain sufficient technical personnel and obtain sufficient external subcontractor capacity 
we have experienced rapid growth in our total revenues in each of the last three years 
our revenues increased from million to million to million to million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in order to increase our annual revenues  we must continue to achieve design wins over other infiniband and ethernet providers and providers of competing interconnect technologies 
we consider a design win to occur when an oem or contract manufacturer notifies us that it has selected our products to be incorporated into a product or system under development 
because the life cycles for our customers products can last for several years if these products have successful commercial introductions  we expect to continue to generate revenues over an extended period of time for each successful design win 
it is difficult for us to forecast the demand for our products  in part because of the highly complex supply chain between us and the end user markets that incorporate our products 
demand for new features changes rapidly 
due to our lengthy product development cycle  it is critical for us to anticipate changes in demand for our various product features and the applications they serve to allow sufficient time for product design 
our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers 
conversely  our failure to forecast declining demand or shifts in product mix can result in excess or obsolete inventory 
revenues 
we derive revenues from sales of our ics and hca cards 
to date  we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers 
total sales to customers representing more than of revenues accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss of one or more of our principal customers or the reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by one of these customers could cause our revenues to decline materially if we are unable to increase our revenues from other customers 

table of contents cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of silicon wafers purchased from our foundry supplier  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  costs associated with the assembly  packaging and production testing of our products by advanced semiconductor engineering  or ase  outside processing costs associated with the manufacture of our hca cards by flextronics  royalties due to third parties  including the office of the chief scientist of israel s ministry of industry  trade and labor  or the ocs  the binational industrial research and development foundation  or bird  and a third party licensor  warranty costs  excess and obsolete inventory costs and costs of personnel associated with production management and quality assurance 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from our foundries  we also have the yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into semiconductor devices 
manufacturing yield is the percentage of acceptable product resulting from the manufacturing process  as identified when the product is tested as a finished ic 
if our manufacturing yields decrease  our cost per unit increases  which could have a significant adverse impact on our cost of revenues 
we do not have long term pricing agreements with tsmc and ase 
accordingly  our costs are subject to price fluctuations based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
we purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we estimate that lead times for delivery of our finished semiconductors from our foundry supplier and assembly  packaging and production testing subcontractor are approximately three to four months  lead times for delivery from our hca card manufacturing subcontractor are approximately eight to ten weeks  and lead times for delivery from our switch systems manufacturing subcontractor are approximately twelve weeks 
we build inventory based on forecasts of customer orders rather than the actual orders themselves 
in addition  as customers are increasingly seeking opportunities to reduce their lead times  we may be required to increase our inventory to meet customer demand 
we expect our cost of revenues to increase over time as a result of the expected increase in our sales volume 
although our cost of revenues as a percentage of sales has decreased over time  primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and economies of scale related to higher unit volumes  we expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of sales to increase in the future as a result of a reduction in the average sale price of our products and higher percentage of revenue deriving from sales of hca cards and switch systems  which generally yield lower gross margins 
this trend will depend on overall customer demand for our products  our product mix  competitive product offerings and related pricing and our ability to reduce manufacturing costs 
operational expenses research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees engaged in research and development  costs associated with computer aided design software tools  depreciation expense and tape out costs 
tape out costs are expenses related to the manufacture of new products  including charges for mask sets  prototype wafers  mask set revisions and testing incurred before releasing new products 
we anticipate these expenses will increase in future periods based on an increase in personnel to support our product development activities and the introduction of new products 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses may fluctuate over the course of a year based on the timing of our product tape outs 
we received grants from the ocs for several projects 
under the terms of these grants  if products developed from an ocs funded project generate revenue  we are required to pay a royalty of to of the net sales as soon as we begin to sell such products until of the dollar value of the grant plus interest at libor is repaid 
all of the grants we have received from the ocs have resulted in ic products sold by us 
we received no grants from the ocs during the years ended december  and we have received total grants from ocs in the amount of million 
as of december   we had concluded all our obligations in respect of royalties payable to the ocs 
the terms of ocs grants generally prohibit the manufacture of products developed with ocs funding outside of israel without the prior consent of the ocs 
the ocs has approved the manufacture outside of israel of our ic products  subject to an undertaking by us to pay the ocs royalties on the sales of our ocs supported products until such time as the total royalties paid equal of the amount of ocs grants 
under applicable israeli law  ocs consent is also required to transfer technologies developed with ocs funding to third parties in israel 
transfer of ocs funded technologies outside of israel is permitted with the 
table of contents approval of the ocs and in accordance with the restrictions and payment obligations set forth under israeli law 
israeli law further specifies that both the transfer of know how as well as the transfer of intellectual property rights in such know how are subject to the same restrictions 
these restrictions do not apply to exports of products from israel or the sale of products developed with these technologies 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees engaged in sales  marketing and customer support  commission payments to external sales representatives and charges for trade shows  promotions and travel 
we expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in sales and marketing personnel and increased commission payments 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees engaged in finance  human resources and administrative activities and charges for accounting and corporate legal fees 
we expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in personnel to meet the requirements associated with being a public company 
taxes on income our operations in israel have been granted approved enterprise status by the investment center of the israeli ministry of industry  trade and labor  which makes us eligible for tax benefits under the israeli law for encouragement of capital investments  under the terms of the approved enterprise program  income that is attributable to our operations in yokneam  israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of ten years commencing when we first generate taxable income after setting off our losses from prior years 
income that is attributable to our operations in tel aviv  israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of two years commencing when we first generate taxable income and will be subject to a reduced income tax rate generally  depending on the percentage of foreign investment in the company for the following five to eight years 
the company expected the approved enterprise tax holiday associated with its yokneam and tel aviv operations to begin in  but due to certain favorable tax rulings obtained during the year ended december   and revisions to the level of future taxable profit in israel  the tax holiday is now expected to begin in the yokneam tax holiday is expected to expire in and the tel aviv tax holiday is expected to expire between and the modification as to when the tax holiday is expected to begin resulted in the company recording additional deferred tax assets associated with research and development costs and net operating loss carryforwards that will offset anticipated taxable profits in israel during and critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  fair value of financial instruments  short term investments  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  warranty provision  share based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for further information on all of our significant accounting policies  please see note of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we account for our revenue under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenues from sales of products are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement with our customers typically includes freight on board 
table of contents shipping point  day payment terms  no right of return and no customer acceptance provisions 
we generally rely upon a purchase order as persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we determine whether collectibility is probable on a customer by customer basis 
when assessing the probability of collection  we consider the number of years the customer has been in business and the history of our collections 
customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial positions and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  no product is shipped and no revenue is recognized unless cash is received in advance 
for multiple element arrangements  that include a combination of hardware and services  such as post contract customer support  revenue is allocated to the separate elements based on fair value 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  the company defers the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
if the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  no revenue is recognized 
the amount and impact on our consolidated financial statements of undelivered elements has historically been insignificant 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts 
if we determine that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  we provide a specific allowance for credit losses to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis and our historical experience with each customer 
customers are subject to an ongoing credit review process that evaluates the customers financial positions 
we review and update our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
our bad debt expense totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
we believe that the carrying amounts of the financial instruments approximate their respective fair values 
when there is no readily available market data  we may make fair value estimates  which may not necessarily represent the amounts that could be realized in a current or future sale of these assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements 
sfas clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
sfas also requires that a fair value measurement reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available 
assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the model 
the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
short term investments we classify short term investment as available for sale securities 
we view our available for sale portfolio as available for use in current operations 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and we record temporary unrealized holding gains and losses as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we charge unrealized losses against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  the extent to which fair value is less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific identification method 

table of contents inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on net realizable value 
cost is determined for raw materials on a first in  first out basis  for work in process based on actual costs and for finished goods based on standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasted demand generally over six to nine months period and market conditions 
inventory reserves are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until it is either sold or scrapped 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets include equipment  furniture and fixtures  equity investment in a privately held company and intangible assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sfas  which requires that long lived assets held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
under sfas  if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the long lived assets is less than the carrying amount of such assets  an impairment loss would be recognized  and the assets would be written down to their estimated fair values 
we review for impairment on a regular basis 
as of december   we held a  investment in a privately held company 
we account for this investment under the cost method 
to determine if impairment exists  we monitor the privately held company s revenue and earnings trends relative to pre defined milestones and overall business prospects  the general market conditions in its industry and other factors related to its ability to remain in business  such as liquidity and receipt of additional funding 
during the fourth quarter of  we identified certain events or changes in circumstances indicating that the fair value of this investment had been negatively impacted and determined that the impairment of this investment was other than temporary 
as a result  we recorded a  impairment loss on this investment 
the impairment loss was included in other income expense on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  warranty provision we provide a limited warranty for periods of up to three years from the date of delivery against defects in materials and workmanship 
if a customer has a defective product  we will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge 
we record estimated warranty expenses at the time we recognize the associated product revenues based on our historical rates of return and costs of repair over the preceding month period 
in addition  we recognize estimated warranty expenses for specific defects at the time those defects are identified 
share based compensation the company has in effect stock incentive plans under which incentive stock options have been granted to employees and non qualified stock options have been granted to employees and non employee members of the board of directors 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees 
effective january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based upon their respective grant date fair values 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is principally recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service periods 
we have estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and that are freely transferable 
the black scholes model considers  among other factors  the expected life of the award and the expected volatility of 
table of contents our stock price 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and stock purchase rights under sfas r on a quarterly basis 
income taxes to prepare the company s consolidated financial statements  the company estimates its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax asset is based on its belief that it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which the company does not believe meets the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas the company s judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  tax planning strategies or other factors 
if the company s assumptions and consequently its estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of its worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region  the availability of tax credits and carryforwards  and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb financial accounting standards interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
upon implementation of fin  the company recognized no material adjustment to the january  accumulated deficit balance 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net benefit from provision for taxes on income net income comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
this increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased unit sales of approximately  and an increase in average selling prices of 
the increase in unit sales was primarily due to increases in sales to our tier one customers 
unit sales to hewlett packard increased by  to sun microsystems by and to qlogic by 
these were partially offset by a decrease in unit sales to cisco systems of and voltaire of 
the increase in average selling price was primarily due to a change in product mix  that is an increase in sales of our quad data rate qdr and double data rate ddr products for which we charge higher average selling prices 
revenues attributable to qdr products  which were introduced in the second quarter of  represented of total revenues in the year ended december  revenues attributable to ddr products represented and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the revenues are not necessarily indicative of future results due to market uncertainty and diminished expectations of slower global economic growth 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  gross margin increased to in the year ended december  from approximately in the year ended december  this increase in gross margin was primarily due to increased sales of qdr and ddr products for which we receive higher margins and to the conclusion of our ocs royalty obligation 
during we incurred royalty expenses of  compared to million in in addition  part of the gross margin improvement was due to a reduction in production costs associated with outsourced labor  raw materials and volume discounts 
gross margin for is not necessarily indicative of future results due to market uncertainty and diminished expectations of slower global economic growth 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher salary related expenses of approximately million associated with increased headcount and merit increases  an increase in share based compensation of approximately million primarily due to new option grants  an increase in new product expenses of approximately million primarily due to tape out costs  and increased depreciation and amortization of equipment  
table of contents software and intellectual property of approximately million arising from purchases of property  equipment and technology licenses 
we expect that research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to devote resources to develop new products  meet the changing requirements of our customers  expand into new markets and technologies and hire additional personnel

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher salary related expenses of approximately million associated with merit increases  an increase in share based compensation of approximately  primarily due to new option grants and an increase in trade show and advertising expenses of approximately  related to expanding our sales and marketing activities  partially offset by a decrease in external sales commission expenses of approximately  related to the adoption of a new plan 
for a further discussion of share based compensation included in sales and marketing expense  see share based compensation expense below 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily due to higher employee related expenses of approximately  associated primarily with increased headcount and merit increases  an increase in share based compensation of approximately  due to new option grants  an increase of approximately  in professional service fees and an increase of approximately  in audit fees  which was primarily attributable to sox section implementation costs 
share based compensation expense 
the following table presents details of total share based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of income year ended december  in thousands cost of goods sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative the amount of unearned share based compensation currently estimated to be expensed from through related to unvested share based payment awards at december  is million 
of this amount  million  million  million and million are currently estimated to be recorded in   and  respectively 
the weighted average period over which the unearned share based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
the increase in unearned share based compensation of million at december  from the million balance at december  was primarily the result of share based awards granted during including the grant of employee stock options to new employees  merit grants to existing employees and the accumulation of rights to purchase our ordinary shares by employees participating in our employee stock purchase program  offset in part by share based compensation of million expensed during if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
future share based compensation expense and unearned share based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 

table of contents other income  net 
other income  net consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
other income  net was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decline is primarily attributable to a decrease of million in interest income on investments in securities as a result of lower yields and a loss of  recognized as a result of the impairment of our equity investment in a privately held company 
benefit from provision for taxes on income 
provision for taxes was million for the year ended december  as compared to a benefit from taxes on income of million for the year ended december  in the year ended december   we released a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets of million primarily related to net operating losses in israel expected to be utilized during before the approved enterprise tax holiday was expected to begin 
in the year ended december   we recorded additional deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses expected to be utilized to offset israeli taxable profits during and due to a modification as to when the tax holiday would begin 
the million difference between the income from taxes recognized as a result of the release of the valuation allowance of million on certain deferred tax assets in offset by a net tax expense of million associated with taxable profits in israel during  net of the additional deferred tax assets recorded for the expected tax profits during and  was the primary reason for the change in our tax results 
in accordance with sfas  we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
due to the recent economic slowdown and its potential impact on our future profitability and the implementation of certain tax planning strategies  we currently expect the approved enterprise tax holiday to begin in comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
this increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased unit sales of approximately  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of 
the increase in unit sales was driven by broader adoption of infiniband and our products and resulted primarily from increased purchases by hewlett packard  voltaire and cisco  which accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenue for the year ended december  and increased purchases by network appliance  super micro computer and sun microsystems  which each accounted for less than of our revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in average sales prices was primarily attributed to the decline in average sales price of ics 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  gross margin increased to in the year ended december  from approximately in the year ended december  this increase in gross margin was primarily due to a reduction in production costs associated with outsourced labor  raw materials and volume discounts 
in addition  part of the gross margin improvement was due to increased sales of next generation double data rate ddr products for which we receive higher margins

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period less than beyond contractual obligations total year years years in thousands commitments under capital lease non cancelable operating lease commitments service commitments purchase commitments total at december   we have no contractual obligations expected to have an effect on our liquidity and cash flow in periods beyond five years 
for purposes of this table  purchase and service obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
in addition  we have purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the contractual obligation table excludes our fin liabilities because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of cash payment 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately  which would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate  if recognized

the intent of fsp fas is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r and other applicable accounting literature 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe that the implementation of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

sfas will change the accounting and reporting for minority interests  reporting them as equity separate from the parent entity s equity  as well as requiring expanded disclosures 
sfas r and sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe that the implementation of these standards will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of currency exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is to the israeli new shekel  or nis 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
in fiscal year  we used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of operating expenses denominated in nis 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income expense or as a component of accumulated oci and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses in the same period in which the hedged operating expenses are recognized 
see note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k included in item of this report 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the united states  recent market and economic conditions have been unprecedented and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower growth throughout  and have led to increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have continued subsequent to the year end and contributed to unprecedented levels of volatility 
as a result  the cost and availability of credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
concern about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specifically has led many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability  and the ability of our customers  to timely replace maturing liabilities  and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
this credit crisis may have a potential impact on the determination of the fair value of financial instruments or may result in impairments in the future should the value of certain investments suffer a decline which is 
table of contents determined to be other than temporary 
we do not currently believe that the impact of this credit crisis on the value of our marketable securities would be material or warrant a determination of other than a temporary write down 
interest rate fluctuation risk we do not have any long term borrowings 
our investments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term deposits and interest bearing investments in marketable securities with maturities of one year or less  consisting of commercial paper  government and non government debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we derive all of our revenues in us dollars 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency in all of our foreign locations 
however  a significant portion of our headcount related expenses  consisting principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  are denominated in new israeli shekels  or nis 
this foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the us dollar against the nis 
furthermore  we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in nis 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against the nis  we will experience a negative impact on our profit margins 
we believe that the rate of inflation in israel has not had a material impact on our business to date 
our cost in israel in us dollar terms will increase if inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the nis against the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind inflation in israel 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we have established a balance sheet and anticipated transaction risk management program 
currency forward contracts and natural hedges are generally utilized in this hedging program 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
our hedging program reduces  but does not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements see part ii  item a  risk factors 
if we were to experience a change in currency exchange rates  the impact on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions  would result in a loss before taxes of approximately  at december  there would also be an impact on future operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
at december   approximately million of our monthly operating expenses were denominated in nis 
as of december   the company had forward contracts in place that hedged future operating expenses of approximately million nis  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate as of december  the forward contracts cover future nis denominated operating expenses expected to occur over the next twelve months 
the company s derivatives expose it to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement 
the company seeks to mitigate such risk by limiting its counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across a number of major financial institutions 
however  under current market conditions  failure of one or more of these financial institutions is possible and could result in incurred losses
