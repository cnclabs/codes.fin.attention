item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized and profitable financial institution dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy 
since being organized in  we grew to become  prior to our initial public offering of stock in april  the nation s largest mutually owned savings and loan association based on total assets 
we credit our success to our continued emphasis on our primary values love  trust  respect  and a commitment to excellence  along with some fun 
our values are reflected in our pricing of loan and deposit products  as well as our home today program  as described below 
our values are further reflected in the broadway redevelopment initiative a long term revitalization program encompassing the three mile corridor of the broadway slavic village neighborhood in cleveland  ohio where our main office is located and the education programs we have established and or supported 
we intend to continue to support our customers 
the financial services industry continues to suffer high volatility and adverse financial conditions 
regionally high unemployment  widespread sub prime mortgage lending  slumping residential real estate values  illiquid capital and credit markets  and a general lack of confidence in the financial service sector of the economy as a result of recent bank failures present challenges for us 
management believes that the following matters are those most critical to our success controlling our interest rate risk exposure  monitoring and limiting our credit risk  maintaining access to adequate liquidity and alternative funding sources  and monitoring and controlling operating expenses 
controlling our interest rate risk exposure 
although followers of today s economic environment are intensely focused on housing and credit issues  historically our greatest risk has been interest rate risk exposure 
when we hold long term  fixed rate assets  funded by liabilities with shorter repricing characteristics  we are exposed to the potentially adverse impact of rising interest rates 
generally  and particularly over extended periods of time that encompass full economic cycles  interest rates associated with longer terms have been higher than interest rates associated with shorter terms 
this difference has been an important factor in the generation of net interest income for us and is fundamental to our operations 
we manage the risk of holding long term  fixed rate mortgage assets by moderating the attractiveness of our loan offerings  thereby controlling the level of additions new originations to our portfolio  and by periodically selling long term  fixed rate mortgage loans in the secondary market to reduce the amount of those assets held in our portfolio 
during the fiscal year ended september   we sold billion of long term  fixed rate mortgage loans compared to million and million  during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
at september   we retained approximately billion of long term  fixed rate mortgage loans in our mortgage loans held for investment portfolio 
while there is no current evidence to indicate that interest rate increases are imminent  should a rapid and substantial increase occur in general market interest rates  it is probable that prospectively  the level of our net interest income would be adversely impacted 
we can also manage interest rate risk with our equity lines of credit which had a net increase of to million during the fiscal year ended while equity lines of credit help manage interest rate risk there is an incremental credit risk associated with them which is described below 
monitoring and limiting our credit risk 
while  historically  we had been successful in limiting our credit risk exposure by generally imposing high credit standards with respect to lending  the recent confluence of dramatically unfavorable regional and macro economic events  coupled with our expanded participation in the second lien mortgage lending markets  has significantly refocused our attention with respect to credit risk 
in response to the evolving economic landscape  we have continuously revised and updated our quarterly analysis and evaluation procedures for each category of our lending with the objective of identifying and recognizing all appropriate credit impairments 
at september   more than of our assets consisted of residential real 
table of contents estate loans and equity loans and lines of credit  the overwhelming majority of which were originated to borrowers in the states of ohio and florida 
our analytic procedures and evaluations include specific reviews of all equity lines of credit that become or more days past due as well as specific reviews of all first mortgage loans and equity loans that become or more days past due 
in response to current market conditions  and in an effort to limit our credit risk exposure and improve the credit performance of new customers  we have tightened our credit criteria in evaluating a borrower s ability to successfully fulfill his or her repayment obligation and we have revised the design of many of our loan products to require higher borrower down payments  limited the products available for condominiums  and eliminated certain product features such as interest only adjustable rate loans  and loans above certain loan to value ratios 
one aspect of our credit risk concern relates to the high percentage of our loans that are secured by residential real estate in the states of ohio and florida  particularly in light of the highly publicized difficulties that have arisen with respect to the real estate markets in those states 
at september   approximately and of our residential  non home today and construction loans were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
the percentage of those loans delinquent days or more at september  were and  respectively  compared to for the non home today portfolio as a whole 
also  at september   approximately and of our equity loans and lines of credit were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
at september   the percentages of those loans delinquent days or more were and  respectively  compared to for the equity loans and lines of credit portfolio as a whole 
while we focus our attention on  and are concerned with respect to the resolution of all loan delinquencies  as these ratios illustrate  our highest concern is centered on loans that are secured by properties in florida 
as described in earlier sections of item business including non performing assets  delinquent loans  allowance for loan losses and allocation of allowance for loan losses and as further described in the allowance for loan losses portion of the critical accounting policies section that immediately follows this overview  additional details are provided regarding our loan portfolio composition  delinquency statistics  our methodology in evaluating our loan loss provisions and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
information presented in those sections generally indicates that across our portfolio  delinquency amounts and ratios will continue to increase 
as additional job losses are announced and unemployment levels continue to rise  particularly in ohio and florida  and as florida housing values continue to remain depressed due to prior overbuilding and speculation  which has resulted in considerable inventory on the market  we recognize that each of these factors is likely to result in increased delinquencies 
these factors are also indicative of additional credit risk  and in response we have continued to provide more loan loss provisions 
for the fiscal year ended september  our provision for loan losses was million compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
similarly  our allowance for loan losses has increased from million  or of loans  at september  to million  or of loans  at september  and to million  or of loans  at september  our residential home today loans are another area of credit risk concern 
although these loans total million at september  and comprise only of our total loan portfolio balance  they comprise of our total delinquencies and of our days or greater delinquencies 
at september   approximately and of our residential  home today loans were secured by properties in ohio and florida  respectively 
at september   the percentages of those loans delinquent days or more were and  respectively 
the disparity between the portfolio composition ratio and delinquency ratio reflects the nature of the home today loans 
prior to march  these loans were made to customers who  generally because of poor credit scores  would not have otherwise qualified for our loan products 
we do not offer  and have not offered  loan products frequently considered to be designed to target sub prime borrowers containing features such as higher fees or higher rates  interest only or negative amortization  or low initial payment features with adjustable interest rates 
our home today loan products  which prior to march  were made to borrowers whose credit profiles might be described as sub prime  generally contain the same features as loans offered to our non home today borrowers 
the overriding objective of our home today lending  just as it is with our non home today lending  is to create successful homeowners 
we have attempted 
table of contents to manage our home today credit risk by requiring that borrowers attend pre and post borrowing financial management education and counseling and that the borrowers be referred to us by a sponsoring organization with which we have partnered 
further  to manage the credit aspect of these loans  inasmuch as the majority of these buyers do not have sufficient funds for downpayments  some loans include private mortgage insurance 
at september   of home today loans include private mortgage insurance coverage 
from a peak balance of million at december   the total balance of the home today portfolio has slowly  but steadily  declined to million at september  this trend generally reflects the evolving conditions in the mortgage real estate market and the tightening of standards imposed by issuers of private mortgage insurance 
as part of our effort to manage credit risk  effective march   the home today underwriting guidelines are substantially the same as our traditional mortgage product 
inasmuch as most potential home today customers do not have sufficient funds for downpayments  the lack of available private mortgage insurance restricts our ability to extend credit 
unless and until lending standards and private mortgage insurance requirements loosen  we expect the home today portfolio to continue to decline in balance 
maintaining access to adequate liquidity and alternative funding sources 
for most insured depositories  customer and community confidence are critical to their ability to maintain access to adequate liquidity and to conduct business in an orderly fashion 
the company believes that maintaining high levels of capital is one of the most important factors in nurturing customer and community confidence 
accordingly  we have managed the pace of our growth in a manner that reflects our emphasis on high capital levels 
at september   the association s ratio of core capital to adjusted tangible assets a basic industry measure under which is deemed to represent a well capitalized status was 
also  at september   the company s ratio of total shareholders equity to total assets was 
we expect to continue to maintain a high capital ratio 
in managing its level of liquidity  the company monitors available funding sources  which include attracting new deposits  borrowing from others  the conversion of assets to cash and the generation of funds through profitable operations 
the company has traditionally relied on retail deposits as its primary means in meeting its funding needs 
at september   deposits totaled billion  while borrowings totaled million and borrowers advances and servicing escrows totaled million  combined 
in evaluating funding sources  we consider many factors  including cost  duration  current availability  expected sustainability  impact on operations and capital levels 
to attract deposits  we offer our customers attractive rates of return on our deposit products 
our deposit products typically offer rates that are highly competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other financial institutions 
we intend to continue this practice 
we preserve the availability of alternative funding sources through various mechanisms 
first  by maintaining high capital levels  we retain the flexibility to increase our balance sheet size without jeopardizing our capital adequacy 
effectively  this permits us to increase the rates that we offer on our deposit products thereby attracting more potential customers 
second  we pledge available real estate mortgage loans and investment securities with the federal home bank of cincinnati fhlb and the federal reserve bank of cleveland federal reserve 
at september   these collateral pledges support arrangements with the fhlb that provide for additional borrowing capacity of up to billion provided an additional investment in fhlb capital stock of up to million is made and up to million at the federal reserve 
third  we invest in high quality marketable securities that exhibit limited market price variability  and to the extent that they are not needed as collateral for borrowings  can be immediately and efficiently sold in the institutional market and converted to cash 
at september  our investment securities portfolio totaled million 
fourth  a portion of the residential first mortgage loans that we originate are highly liquid as they can be sold delivered to fannie mae 
at september   our mortgage loans held for sale totaled million 
finally  cash flows from operating activities have been a regular source of funds 
during the fiscal years ended september   and  cash flows from operations totaled million  million and million  respectively 
overall  while customer and community confidence can never be assured  the company believes that our liquidity is adequate and that we have adequate access to alternative funding sources 

table of contents monitoring and controlling operating expenses 
we continue to focus on managing operating expenses 
our annualized ratio of non interest expense to average assets was for the fiscal year ending as of september   our average assets per full time employee and our average deposits per full time employee were million and million  respectively 
based on industry statistics published by the office of thrift supervision  we believe that each of these measures compares favorably with the averages for our peer group 
our average deposits held at our branch offices million per branch office as of september  contribute to our expense management efforts by limiting the overhead costs of serving our deposit customers 
we will continue our efforts to control operating expenses as we use a portion of the capital we received in our april stock offering to grow our business 
our current focus is in broward county  florida  where we opened a full service branch in plantation in september followed by the relocation of the former north miami branch to hallandale in january we recently added two locations in broward county pembroke pines and coral springs  which reduce gaps in our footprint in that market area 
we also expect to continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our existing branch structure  particularly in northeast ohio  seeking opportunities to simultaneously improve our efficiency and the level of service to our customers 
we recently relocated one branch within cleveland s western most suburbs and consolidated two existing branches within cuyahoga county into one new  larger branch located within a mile or two of the consolidated branches 
while we devote a great deal of our attention to managing our operating expenses  certain costs are largely outside of our control 
one expense that has increased dramatically has been our federal deposit insurance premium and assessments  which increased from million during the fiscal year ended september  to million during the fiscal year ended september  on may   the fdic adopted a final rule imposing a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus tier capital as of june  approximately million of the increase reflects this emergency assessment levied as of june  and collected on september  the final rule also permits the board to impose an additional special assessment of up to basis points later in if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
however  on september  the fdic filed a notice of proposed rulemaking which was adopted as a final rule on november  and amended its assessment regulations to require insured institutions to prepay  on december   their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of calendar and for all of the calendar years  and the amount of the prepayment will generally be determined based upon an institution s assessment rate in effect on september  and will reflect a annualized growth factor applied to the institution s assessment base as well as an assessment rate increase of three cents per of deposits effective january  in recognition of the industry s current weakened condition  the prepayment is intended to preclude any additional special assessments during  however  such a prepayment requirement does not necessarily preclude the fdic from changing assessment rates or from revising the risk based assessment system  pursuant to the existing notice and comment rulemaking framework 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition and results of operations depend  and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments  are our policies with respect to our allowance for loan losses  mortgage servicing rights  income taxes  pension benefits and stock based compensation 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
the amount of the allowance is based on significant estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the 
table of contents high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions used and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses 
at september   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance would result in a million charge or credit  respectively  to income before income taxes 
as a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
management carefully reviews the assumptions supporting such appraisals to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
the evaluation has a specific and general component 
the specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as a problem loan through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system 
all such loans are evaluated individually  with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan 
specific allowances are established as required by this analysis 
the general component is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we also analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic concentrations 
historic loss factors used in determining an appropriate allowance level have been supplemented in the current fiscal year by a market valuation allowance that addresses more qualitative factors that impact potential losses 
the conditions evaluated include a combination of various market conditions  mainly a decrease in home values and an increase in unemployment rates  which have caused higher delinquencies and charge offs in the loan portfolio  increased foreclosure rates 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 
actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights represent the present value of the estimated future servicing fees expected to be received pursuant to the right to service loans in our loan servicing portfolio 
mortgage servicing rights are recognized as assets for both purchased rights and for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
the most critical accounting policy associated with mortgage servicing is the methodology used to determine the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
a number of estimates affect the capitalized value and include the mortgage loan prepayment speed assumption  the estimated prospective cost expected to be incurred in connection with servicing the mortgage loans  and the discount factor used to compute the present value of the mortgage servicing right 
the mortgage loan prepayment speed assumption is significantly affected by interest rates 
in general  during periods of falling interest rates  mortgage loans prepay faster and the value of our mortgage servicing assets decreases 
conversely  during periods of rising rates  the value of mortgage servicing rights generally increases due to slower rates of prepayments 
the estimated prospective cost expected to be incurred in connection with servicing the mortgage loans is deducted from the retained gross mortgage loan interest rate less amounts remitted to third parties investor pass thru rate  guarantee fee  mortgage insurance fee  etc 
servicing fee to determine the net servicing fee for purposes of capitalization computations 
to the extent that prospective actual costs incurred to service the mortgage loans differ from the estimate  our future results will be adversely or favorably impacted 
the discount factor selected to compute the present value of the servicing right reflects expected market place yield requirements 

table of contents the amount and timing of mortgage servicing rights amortization is adjusted monthly based on actual results 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform a valuation review of mortgage servicing rights for potential decreases in value 
this quarterly valuation review entails applying current assumptions to the portfolio classified by interest rates and  secondarily  by prepayment characteristics 
at september   the capitalized value of our right to service billion of loans for others was million  or of the serviced loan portfolio 
income taxes 
we consider accounting for income taxes a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
we use the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we must assess the realization of the deferred tax asset and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
during the fiscal year ended september   we increased the required deferred tax valuation allowance with respect to the expected carry forward portion of our million charitable contribution expense incurred in conjunction with the formation of the third federal foundation from million to million 
although we have determined a valuation allowance is not required for any other deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that those assets  nor the portion of deferred tax asset associated with the carryforward of our charitable contribution not subject to a valuation allowance  will be recognizable in the future 
pension benefits 
the determination of our obligations and expense for pension benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions could materially affect future pension obligations and expense 
stock based compensation 
we recognize the cost of associate and director services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation 
we estimate the per share value of option grants using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term 
these assumptions are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
the per share value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
in general  the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction from changes in the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term  and in the opposite direction as changes in expected dividend yield 
for example  the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock volatility increases  risk free interest rate increases  expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases 
the use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options 
comparison of financial condition at september  and total assets decreased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  the reduction in assets was the result of decreases in the mortgage loans held for sale portfolio and investment securities which were offset by an increase in other interest earning cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september   as we have retained our most liquid assets for subsequent reinvestment in investment securities and or loan products that provide higher yields along with longer maturities 
this increase 
table of contents is the result of successful deposit gathering programs combined with the cash flows from maturing investment securities and loan sales in the secondary market 
investment securities held to maturity decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  this decrease is a result of cash flows from securities repayments and maturities during the twelve month period being used to fund the retirement of short term debt and the repurchase of common stock as part of our stock repurchase program 
there were million in purchases of investment securities in the twelve month period ended september   which were only partially offset by principal paydowns 
there were no sales of investment securities 
paydowns on mortgage backed securities increased due to the historically low mortgage interest rates and can be expected to continue  although at perhaps a slower pace  as borrowers continue to take advantage of lower rates 
paydowns may  absent an increase in investment securities purchases  result in additional decreases in the balance of investment securities 
mortgage loans held for sale decreased million or  to million at september  from million at september  this change can be attributed to the volume of loan sales keeping pace due to favorable market conditions with the loans originated during the current fiscal year ended september  loans held for investment  net  increased million  or less than  to billion at september  from billion at september  mortgage loans in our investment portfolio increased million to billion at september  from billion at september  the increase in mortgage loans was offset by a million increase to million from million in our allowance for loan losses 
the increased allowance reflects the continued increase in the unprecedented level of net charge offs over the past few quarters and the uncertain economic times that face many of our loan customers 
a combination of various market conditions  mainly a decrease in home values and an increase in unemployment rates  have caused higher delinquencies and charge offs in the loan portfolio 
in an effort to manage interest rate risk  we continued to focus on increased equity line of credit originations  which had a net increase of million during the current fiscal year 
these equity line of credit originations do incrementally affect credit risk because the security received is a second lien 
residential mortgage loans decreased million during the current fiscal period  which reflected billion in sales during that time period 
through the sales of loans in the secondary market we can improve our interest rate risk position in the event of increases in market interest rates 
our portfolio of real estate owned increased million  or  to million at september   from million at september  while the balance of real estate owned continues to comprise less than of both our billion of total assets as well as our billion loan portfolio  the increase is nevertheless indicative of the current challenging economic environment and its negative impact on the residential housing market  which has been evidenced by increases in the balances of non performing loans and loan charge offs 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses upon transfer to real estate owned 
fair value is monitored quarterly and any subsequent decline in fair value of real estate owned is recorded as a loss and reported in other non interest expense 
if unemployment in ohio continues to rise in the future we expect the current high level of foreclosures will continue 
as a result  it is possible the balance of real estate owned will increase 
deposits increased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  the increase in deposits was primarily the result of a million increase in certificates of deposit combined with million increase in high yield savings accounts a subcategory of our savings accounts  offset by a million decrease in our high yield checking accounts 
other deposit products other savings accounts and other now accounts saw a net decrease in the current fiscal year 
we have focused on promoting the high yield savings accounts as well as high yield checking accounts as we believe that these types of deposit products provide a stable source of funds 
in addition  our high yield checking and high yield savings accounts are expected to reprice in a manner similar to our equity loan products  and  therefore  assist us in managing interest rate risk 

table of contents borrowed funds decreased million  or  to million at september  from at september  the million in borrowed funds consists of fixed rate fhlb advances with an average maturity of years 
using longer term advances helps reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the success of our deposit gathering  use of cash flows from the maturing investments in our securities portfolio  cash flows from the sale of loans in the secondary market and the net cash provided by our operating activities can be attributed to the decrease in borrowed funds 
the million increase in principal  interest and related escrows owed on loans serviced  to million at september  from million at september   is related to the timing of when payments have been collected from borrowers for loans we service for other investors and when those funds are remitted to the investors and to the appropriate taxing agencies 
the change can be attributed to an increase of million in principal and interest payments as resulting from increased prepayments and a million increase in retained tax payments collected from borrowers 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased million to million at september  from million at september  this change primarily reflects a million increase in the accruals related to our retirement and pension plans along with a million increase in a payable to the fdic as a result of the higher deposit insurance rates and to a lesser extent higher balances 
these were offset by decreases in a million payable related to the repurchase of common stock  the in transit status of million of real estate tax payments that have been collected from borrowers and are being remitted to various taxing agencies  and million in accrued expenses 
shareholders equity decreased million  to billion at september  from billion at september  this reflects million of net income during the current fiscal year reduced by million of repurchases of outstanding common stock and million in dividends paid on our shares of common stock other than the shares held by third federal savings  mhc and unallocated esop shares in the current fiscal year 
the remainder reflects adjustments related to the allocation of shares of our common stock related to the esop and stock compensation plans and adjustments to our accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable primarily to the change in our pension obligation 

table of contents analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income we earn on our interest earning assets and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities 
average balances and yields 
the following table sets forth average balance sheets  average yields and costs  and certain other information at and for the fiscal years indicated 
no tax equivalent yield adjustments were made  as the effect thereof was not material 
all average balances for the fiscal years and are daily average balances while fiscal year average balances are monthly average balances 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances  but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield

net income decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september  this change was attributed to increases in the provision for loan losses and non interest expenses partially offset by increases in both net interest income and non interest income 
interest income 
interest income decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the same period in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income resulted primarily from decreases in interest income from loans and mortgage backed securities along with a decrease in the interest received on federal funds 
during the current fiscal year there was thousand of interest income from federal funds sold compared to million in the fiscal year ended september  this was attributed to use of the federal reserve bank to hold overnight cash  and our cash position during the current fiscal year during which we were more frequently a borrower versus the prior fiscal year during which we were more frequently a lender 
excess cash was available to invest in the prior fiscal year due primarily to the remaining proceeds of our april initial public offering 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year as interest rates on adjustable rate securities reset to lower current rates and higher  fixed rate securities experienced accelerated paydowns 
the average balance of mortgage backed securities decreased million to million compared to million during the 
table of contents prior fiscal year 
there were million in purchases which partially offset principal paydowns in this portfolio 
paydowns on mortgage backed securities increased during the current fiscal year due to the historically low mortgage interest rates 
there were no sales of mortgage backed securities during the current fiscal year 
interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million from million when compared to the prior fiscal year 
this change can be attributed to an basis point decrease in the yield to from as historically low interest rates have increased the amount of refinance activity 
the decrease in the yield was partially offset by an million increase in the average balance of loans to billion compared to billion in the prior fiscal year as new loan production exceeded repayments and sales 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended from during the fiscal year ended the change resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense on now accounts  savings accounts and certificates of deposit offset by a small increase in interest expense on borrowed funds 
interest expense on now accounts  which include our high yield checking accounts  decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was caused primarily by a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on now accounts to during the fiscal year ended compared to during the fiscal year ended we decreased rates on deposits in response to decreases in short term market interest rates 
in addition  the average balance of now accounts decreased million  or  to billion compared to billion as existing customers continue to convert now accounts to certificates of deposit 
interest expense on savings accounts decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the yield to compared to 
in addition  the average balance of savings accounts decreased million  or  to billion during the current fiscal year  again reflecting customer preference for certificates of deposit in the current interest rate environment 
interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased million  or  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
the change was attributed to an basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on certificates of deposit to from partially offset by a million  or increase in the average balance to billion from billion as customers were attracted to the certainty of yields provided by certificates of deposit 
rates were adjusted on deposits in response to changes in general market rates as well as to changes in the rates paid by our competition on short term certificates of deposit 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to million for the same period in the prior fiscal year 
as net interest income increased  we experienced an improvement of our interest rate spread  which increased basis points to compared 
our net interest margin increased two basis points to compared to for fiscal year our average net interest earning assets decreased million  to billion during the current fiscal year compared to billion during the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of our using cash to fund stock repurchase programs and to pay stock dividends 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider past and current loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current economic conditions  volume and type of lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non performing and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance 

table of contents we recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the current fiscal year ended september  and a provision of million during the prior fiscal year 
the provisions recorded exceeded net charge offs of million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the increased provisions reflect the continued increase in the unprecedented level of net charge offs over the past few quarters and the uncertain economic times that face many of our loan customers 
a combination of various market conditions  mainly a decrease in home values and an increase in unemployment rates  have caused higher delinquencies and charge offs in the loan portfolio 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  to million during the current fiscal year period compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
fees and service charges  net of amortization decreased million  or  to million compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
this change was attributed to increased amortization on the mortgage servicing asset related to our sold loan portfolio 
increased amortization is the result of additions to the balance of the servicing asset  and increased paydowns due to increased refinancing activity as result of lower interest rates during the current fiscal year 
gains on the sale of loans increased million  to million from million during the prior fiscal year 
this was attributed to billion in loan sales compared to million in the twelve month period ended september  combined with falling interest rates in the current fiscal year 
declining interest rates generally result in higher gains on sales of loans 
loan sales are used by the company as a means of managing interest rate risk 
income loss on private equity funds decreased million to a loss of thousand during the current fiscal year  compared to income of million during the prior fiscal year 
this decrease primarily reflects the recognition of realized gains from disposition of private equity funds during the prior period versus the recognition of unrealized losses on remaining private equity fund investments during the current year 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended september  compared to million during the fiscal year ended september  marketing services decreased million  or  to million during the current fiscal year from million during the prior fiscal year 
the change in media services resulted from a reduction in the amount and the cost of advertising used in the current fiscal year as the voracity of promotional programs targeting equity lending products was moderated  particularly during the latter portion of the current fiscal year  pending the attainment of a more stable economic environment 
federal insurance premiums increased million  or  to million from million when compared to the prior fiscal year 
increased assessment rates  an emergency five basis point assessment  and to a lesser extent  increased deposit balances during the current fiscal year along with the use of available credits during the prior fiscal year resulted in the increased premium expense 
income tax expense 
the provision for income tax was million in the current fiscal year when compared to million during the prior fiscal year  reflecting a million decrease in pre tax income between the two years 
the provision for the current fiscal year included million of federal income tax provision and thousand of state income tax provision 
the million provision for income taxes for the prior fiscal year includes a million provision for state income tax 
state income tax expense in the current fiscal year decreased million when compared to the prior fiscal year as a result of lower pre tax income combined with the reversal of a prior fiscal year state tax accrual 
the state income tax provision is subtracted from income before income taxes when calculating the federal income tax provision 
our effective federal tax 
table of contents rate was for the current fiscal year when compared to for the prior fiscal year 
each of these rates is lower than the federal statutory rate of due to the tax exempt income related to bank owned life insurance 
the difference in the effective federal statutory tax rates this fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year is due to lower pretax income 
our effective tax rate is below the federal statutory rate primarily because of our ownership of bank owned life insurance 
comparison of operating results for the fiscal years ended september  and general 
net income increased million to million in the twelve months ended september  as compared to million in the twelve months ended september  this increase is attributed primarily to the million pre tax contribution expense in the prior year related to the formation of the third federal foundation 
other factors that significantly impacted our earnings for the twelve month periods are described below 
interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million in the twelve months ended september  from million in the same twelve month period ended september  the increase in interest income resulted from increases in interest income on loans and mortgage backed securities partially offset by a decrease in interest income on federal funds 
interest income on federal funds sold was million in the fiscal year ended  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease resulted from a million decrease in the average balance to million from million and lower market yields which were led by the actions of the federal reserve s open market committee  which lowered its federal funds target rate through a series of adjustments beginning in september and continuing through april the average yield on federal funds decreased basis points to from 
the lower average balance of federal funds reflects our deployment of lower yielding federal funds into higher yielding loan products and securities 
interest income on mortgage backed securities increased million  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the average balance of mortgage backed securities increased million to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the average balance resulted primarily from reinvestment of the proceeds from our public stock offering 
the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year 
interest income on loans increased million  or  to million from million when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase can be attributed to a million increase in the average balance of loans to billion when compared to billion in the prior fiscal year as we have deployed cash balances of federal funds into higher yielding loan products and have also reinvested net cash inflows from deposits and borrowings into loan products 
this increase in interest income on loans was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield during the current fiscal year to from in the prior fiscal year which resulted primarily from the reduction in the prime rate of interest that benchmarks the yield on our equity lines of credit loans 
dividend income on federal home loan bank stock decreased million to million in the current fiscal year when compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the average balance of federal home loan bank stock was million  compared to million in prior fiscal year 
the million decrease in the average balance of federal home loan bank stock was the result of a redemption of excess shares in march interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in the fiscal year the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense on now accounts which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on savings accounts 

table of contents interest expense on now accounts which includes our high yield checking accounts decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was caused by a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on now accounts to from in the prior fiscal year 
we decreased rates on deposits in response to decreases in short term market interest rates 
in addition  the average balance of now accounts decreased million  or  to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year as many customers converted their accounts to our new high yield savings products 
interest expense on savings accounts increased million  to million in fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was caused primarily by a million increase in the average balance to billion from million along with a basis point increase in the average rate we paid to in the current fiscal year 
the increases in both average rate and average balance resulted primarily from the introduction in early march of a new high yield savings account that offers depositors a competitive yield 
net interest income 
net interest income increased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the increase resulted primarily from the increase of million in average net interest earning assets  to billion in the current fiscal year from billion during the prior fiscal year  growth which was made possible by the capital raised from our initial public offering which was completed in april the increase in the average balance of net interest earning assets also favorably impacted our interest rate margin which increased to during the current fiscal year from during the last fiscal year 
moving in a contradictory manner however  was our net interest rate spread which decreased six basis points to for the current fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
that decrease resulted primarily from the turmoil in the financial markets related to the impact that losses on sub prime loans had on the ability of certain financial institutions to generate funding sources 
the challenges that those institutions faced in maintaining their funding sources  particularly in the wholesale markets  caused them to become extremely aggressive participants in the retail deposit gathering marketplace  and that aggression resulted in higher interest rates  particularly in shorter terms  offered to deposit customers 
in order to compete  retain customers and attract new customers  the company offered higher rates on its deposit products  and those higher rates had the net effect of preventing our cost of funds from decreasing as quickly as our yield on interest earning assets 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the twelve months ended september  and a provision of million for twelve months ended september  beginning as of june   with quarterly updates thereafter  the provision for loan losses reflect the results of our expanded loan level evaluation of equity lines of credit which are delinquent or more days 
the provisions recorded exceeded net charge offs of million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans receivable at september   compared to million  or of total loans receivable  at september  we increased the allowance for loan losses to address the increased risk related to an increase in non performing loans  higher foreclosure rates  slumping residential housing values and in response to the results of our expanded evaluation of equity lines of credit delinquent days or more 
non performing loans increased by million to million  or of total loans  at september  from million  or of total loans  at september  non interest income 
non interest income decreased million to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  we had net gains of million on loan sales in the current fiscal year  compared to thousand of gains in the prior fiscal year 
net income on private equity investments decreased million  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease primarily reflected the change in gains from the disposition of private equity fund investments in the current and prior fiscal years 
additionally  other non interest income decreased million  to million in the current fiscal year  from million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was due to a million gain recognized in connection with the sale  during fiscal year  of a commercial office building owned by our hazelmere subsidiary  a company that invests in commercial office buildings and leases them to 
table of contents unaffiliated parties 
rental income in the current fiscal year decreased million due to the sale of the aforementioned office building 
we also experienced a decrease of million due to the reduction in rebates from our official check provider when compared to the prior fiscal year 
non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the decrease resulted primarily from the million  pre tax charitable contribution to the foundation made in conjunction with our public stock offering in april offset by increases in salaries and employee benefit expense  in federal insurance premiums  state franchise tax and in other operating expenses 
federal insurance premiums increased million to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the use of available credits in the prior year kept the premiums paid lower when compared to the current year 
state franchise tax increased million  or to million from million in the same period last year 
state franchise tax in ohio  where our principal subsidiary operates  is calculated based on equity 
equity increased significantly as a result of the initial public stock offering and as a result our franchise tax liability increased 
real estate owned expense  net increased million  or  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
this change can be attributed to the expenses  disposition costs and losses associated with real estate owned parcels acquired through foreclosure 
the foreclosure rate was higher  consistent with delinquency trends 
costs and losses were greater due to deteriorating property conditions and slumping housing values  linked we believe to wholesale dumping of housing stock by troubled national mortgage lenders 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
costs associated with being a public company increased thousand  the provision for mortgage reinsurance claims at our captive insurance subsidiary increased thousand  expense to order credit reports increased thousand  and postage courier fees increased thousand 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million for the twelve months ended september   compared to million for the twelve months ended september   reflecting a million increase in pre tax income between the twelve month periods 
our effective tax rate was for the twelve months ended september  as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
our effective tax rate was below the federal statutory rate of in largely because of the beneficial effect of owning bank owned life insurance 
our effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate in because we established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million related to the utilization of our charitable contribution deduction carryforward which arose in connection with our million contribution to third federal foundation 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan sales  loan repayments  advances from the fhlb of cincinnati  borrowings from the federal reserve discount window and maturities and sales of securities 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain collateralized borrowings in the wholesale markets 
of course  in april  access to the equity capital markets had a dramatic impact on our liquidity as evidenced by the million net proceeds from our stock offering 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the association s asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of or greater which we compute as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged investment securities for which ready markets exist  divided by total assets 
for the fiscal year ended september   our liquidity ratio averaged 
we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of september  
table of contents we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are generally invested in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
because we originate a significant amount of loans that qualify for sale in the secondary market  our loans held for sale represent highly liquid assets 
at september   we had million of loans classified as held for sale 
during the fiscal year ended september   we sold billion of long term  fixed rate loans 
the placement of fannie mae and freddie mac under the control of the us treasury department in restored order and liquidity to that market and we expect to continue to be able to sell fixed rate loans 
investment securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at september  also  at september  we had borrowed million from the fhlb of cincinnati 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan commitments outstanding 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had billion in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled billion  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan sales  sales of investment securities  other deposit products  including certificates of deposit  federal home loan bank advances  borrowings from the federal reserve discount window or other collateralized borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
generally  we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activity is originating residential mortgage loans 
during the fiscal year ended september   we originated billion of loans  and during the fiscal year ended september   we originated billion of loans 
we purchased million of securities during the fiscal year ended september   and million during the fiscal year ended september  financing activities consist primarily of changes in deposit accounts and  to a lesser extent  federal home loan bank advances and borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
we experienced a net increase in total deposits of million during the fiscal year ended september  compared to a net increase of million during the fiscal year ended september  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlb of cincinnati and the federal reserve discount window  each of which provides an additional source of funds 
at september  we had million of fhlb of cincinnati advances and no outstanding borrowings from the federal reserve discount window  while at september  our borrowings  which again were only from the fhlb of cincinnati  totaled million 
during the fiscal year ended september   we had average outstanding advances with the fhlb of cincinnati of million and average outstanding borrowings from the federal reserve discount window of million as compared to average borrowings of million  all from the fhlb of cincinnati  during fiscal year at september  we had the ability to immediately borrow 
table of contents an additional million from the fhlb of cincinnati and million from the federal reserve discount window 
from the perspective of collateral value securing fhlb of cincinnati advances  our capacity limit for additional borrowings at september  was billion  subject to satisfaction of the fhlb cincinnati common stock ownership requirement 
to satisfy the common stock ownership requirement we would have to increase our ownership of fhlb cincinnati common stock by an additional million 
third federal savings and loan is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at september   third federal savings and loan exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
third federal savings and loan is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
the net proceeds from the stock offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal our financial condition and results of operations have been enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering  and have resulted in increased net interest earning assets and net interest income during the periods following completion of the offering in april however  due to the increase in equity that resulted from the net proceeds of our stock offering  our return on equity ratios have been adversely affected and can be expected to continue to be so affected prospectively 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we routinely enter into commitments to securitize and sell mortgage loans 
for additional information  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment  agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities and agreements with respect to investments 
the following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at september  the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total in thousands federal home loan bank advances operating leases purchase obligations certificates of deposit private equity investments total commitments to extend credit includes accrued interest payable at september  includes the unused portion of equity lines of credit of billion 

table of contents the company provides mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans in its own portfolio  including home today loans  and loans in its servicing portfolio through contracts with two primary mortgage insurance companies 
under these contracts  the company absorbs mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of loans  subject to a contractual limit  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premiums 
as of september   approximately million of mortgage loans in our portfolios was covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
at september   the maximum losses under the reinsurance contracts were limited to million 
the company has incurred thousand in losses under these reinsurance contracts and provided a liability for estimated losses totaling million as of september  management believes it has made adequate provision for estimated losses 
impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk has historically been interest rate risk 
in general  our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i securitizing and selling long term  fixed rate residential real estate mortgage loans  ii marketing adjustable rate loan products  including equity lines of credit  iii lengthening the weighted average remaining term of major funding sources  primarily by offering attractive interest rates on deposit products  particularly longer term certificates of deposit  iv investing in shorter to medium term investments and mortgage backed securities  and v maintaining high levels of capital 
during  and  billion  million and million  respectively  of long term  fixed rate mortgage loans were securitized and sold 
these sales were undertaken to improve our interest rate risk position in the event that market interest rates increased 
shortening the average maturity of our interest earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter term loans and investments  as well as loans and investments with variable rates of interest  helps to better match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
by following these strategies  we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases in market interest rates 
net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the office of thrift supervision provides all institutions that file a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of npv 
the office of thrift supervision simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
historically  the office of thrift supervision model estimated the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that the united states treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by to basis points in basis point increments 
however  in recent years  an npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
the office of thrift supervision provides us the results of the interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information we provide to the office of thrift supervision to estimate the sensitivity of our npv 

table of contents the table below sets forth  as of september   the office of thrift supervision s calculation of the estimated changes in the npv of the association that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated increase decrease in npv npv as a percentage of present value of assets npv ratio increase decrease basis points amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at september   in the event of an increase of basis points in all interest rates  the association would experience a decrease in npv 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the association would experience a decrease in npv 
the following table is based on the calculations contained in the previous table  and sets forth the change in the npv by regulation the association must measure and manage its interest rate risk for an interest rate shock of basis points  whichever produces the largest decline in npv but because current short term interest rates are so low  only measurements at basis points are available that result from the applicable rate shock  which is basis points at september  and basis points at september  at september  risk measure bp rate shock in and bp rate shock in pre shock npv ratio post shock npv ratio sesitivity measure in basis points 
table of contents the following table presents our internal calculations of the estimated changes in the association s npv at september  and that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
change in interest rates basis points npv as a percentage of present value of assets npv ratio at september  assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in npv 
modeling changes in npv require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv tables presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results 
additionally  both the estimates prepared by the ots as well as our internal estimates are significantly impacted by the numerous assumptions used in preparing the npv calculations 
in general  the assumptions used by the ots are  by necessity  more generic as their modeling framework must fit and be adaptable to all institutions subject to its regulation 
our internal model on the other hand  is tailored specifically to our organization which  we believe  improves the accuracy of our internally prepared npv estimates 
net interest income 
in addition to npv calculations  we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our internal net interest income model 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  we estimate what our net interest income would be for a twelve month period using office of thrift supervision pricing tables for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  and the bloomberg forward yield curve for assumptions as to projected interest rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates 
as of september   we estimated that our net interest income for the twelve months ending september  would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net interest income 
modeling changes in net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the interest rate risk information presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and 
table of contents assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
