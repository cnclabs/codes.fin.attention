item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying audited financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when goods are shipped from our production facilities or outside warehouses and the following four criteria have been met i the product has been shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
we record as deductions against sales all trade discounts  returns and allowances that occur in the ordinary course of business  when the sale occurs 
to the extent we charge our customers for freight expense  it is included in revenues 
the amount of freight costs charged to customers has not been material to date 
accounts receivable 
the majority of our accounts receivables are due from distributors domestic and international and retailers 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are most often due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we determine whether an allowance is necessary by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we do not accrue interest on accounts receivable past due 
allowance for inventory obsolescence 
we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market price 
we maintain an allowance for inventory obsolescence for losses resulting from inventory items becoming unsaleable due to expiration of product shelf life  loss of specific customers or changes in customers requirements 
based on historical and projected sales information  we believe our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could cause our customers purchasing requirements to change 
these changes could affect our ability to sell our inventory  therefore  the allowance for inventory obsolescence is reviewed regularly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
income taxes 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which could result in additional income tax expense 
upon the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 january   we recognized a liability of  with respect to our uncertain tax positions  including related interest or penalties  which resulted in a direct charge to retained earnings 
our federal and state tax returns are open to examination for the years through  however  the internal revenue service commenced an examination of our federal income tax returns for  and in recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  which will become effective for business combination transactions having an acquisition date on or after january  this standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date to be measured at their respective fair values 
the statement requires acquisition related costs  as well as restructuring costs the acquirer expects to incur for which it is not obligated at acquisition date  to be recorded against income rather than included in purchase price determination 
it also requires recognition of contingent arrangements at their acquisition date fair values  with subsequent changes in fair value generally reflected in income 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our company  as no acquisitions are currently contemplated 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 which will become effective for us january   with retroactive adoption of the statement s presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
this standard will require ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to be presented within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet but separate from the parent s equity 
it will also require the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest to be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated income statement 
certain changes in a parent s ownership interest are to be accounted for as equity transactions and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary is to be initially measured at fair value 
we do not anticipate the implementation of sfas no 
will significantly change the presentation of our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
 application of fasb statement no 
to fasb statement no 
and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements that address leasing transactions  which became effective for us on december  this fsp excludes fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases  and its related interpretive accounting pronouncements from the provisions of sfas no 
implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fsp no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays our january  effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until january  implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which amends and expands the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to require qualitative disclosure about objectives and strategies in using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about the underlying credit risk related contingent features in derivative agreements 
sfas no 
is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring transparency about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entity s financial statements  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
 and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect its financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  implementation of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
results of operations fifty two weeks ended december  compared with fifty two weeks ended december  we operate on a fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december fiscal years for the financial statements included herein are the fifty two week period ended december  and the fifty two week period ended on december  net sales for the fifty two weeks ended december  were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  for the fifty two weeks ended december  although sales increased in fiscal  our gross profit in fiscal decreased by  or  while our gross profit percentage decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the entire frozen dessert industry was subject to significant price increases to certain key ingredients and packaging  due mainly to supply shortages as a result of political events in certain foreign countries  the general economic situation here in the united states and the cost of petroleum  from which a number of our packaging items are produced 
this was partially offset by an increase of freight out expense  which was only marginal despite significant increases in the cost of fuel throughout most of  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this marginal increase is attributable in part to the fact that shipping our frozen dessert novelties from our new ice cream co packer in indiana to the west coast is more cost effective than shipping them from our third party mountville  pennsylvania warehouse or from our former frozen dessert novelties manufacturer s location  and in part because in some instances we increased the minimum size of orders to customers where we paid the freight  which reduced our shipping costs 
while we anticipate that our gross profit will increase due to increased unit sales and higher sales prices in  our expected gross profit percentage will not improve materially due to promotional allowances associated with the planned introduction of new products 
we also expect ingredient costs for certain key items and packaging costs to continue at their current high levels 
selling and warehousing expenses increased by  to  for fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was caused primarily by a  increase in payroll costs due to the hiring of an additional person in sales and an  increase in bad debt expense 
we anticipate that with the exception of commission expenses and outside warehouse rental expense  which are variable to sales  all other selling expenses in should remain relatively consistent with our expenses in marketing expenses increased by  in fiscal to  as compared to  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to a  increase in television advertising expense for a pilot program in one of our consumer markets and a  increase in newspaper advertising expense partially offset by a decrease in artwork and plates expense of  newspaper advertising expenses increased due to additional costs incurred for advertising in some new advertising venues 
we expect marketing expenses to decrease in fiscal product development expenses increased to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal the increase was caused primarily by increases in payroll costs of  lab costs and supplies of  and professional fees and outside services of  our management expects that product development costs in will remain consistent with fiscal costs 
general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal as compared with  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in stock based compensation expense as a result of the accounting charge associated with a modification and cash pay out for the redemption of a stock option  which was considered additional compensation expense for financial reporting purposes in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by increases in payroll costs of  and professional fees and outside services of  we anticipate that professional fees and outside services  which include legal and accounting fees  will increase in fiscal primarily due to the costs associated with compliance with the internal controls provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
our management expects that general and administrative expenses in will remain consistent with fiscal expenses 
overall  total operating expenses in fiscal increased to  an increase of  or  from total operating expenses in fiscal total operating expenses in fiscal were impacted by  in stock based compensation expense included in our general and administrative expenses for  the result of an accounting charge associated with a modification and cash pay out for the redemption of a stock option 
had we not incurred that charge  the increase in total operating expenses from to would have been  or 
income before income taxes decreased by  to  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal as a result of our reduced gross profit and higher operating expenses 
income taxes for the current fiscal period were  or of taxable income  compared to  or of taxable income  in fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal was due to permanent differences as well as an increase to our fin liability 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our working capital was  a decrease of  from december  our current and quick acid test ratios  both measures of liquidity  were and  respectively  at december  compared to and  respectively  at december  we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   and the cash flows expected from operations will be sufficient to support us for at least the next twelve months 
at december   accounts receivable decreased by  to  from december   reflecting an increase in cash collections and a slight reduction in sales in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december  the average number of days used to collect our gross accounts receivable in fiscal was days as compared to days in fiscal at december   inventories increased to  from  at december  the increase in our inventories is due to a buildup in finished goods levels to support our anticipated sales in accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased by  to  at december   from  at december   reflecting a reduction in our purchases of ingredients  packaging and finished goods in the fourth quarter 
our board of directors first instituted a share repurchase program in september which has to date authorized the repurchase of  shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares with a total cost of  or an average price of per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased an additional  shares for  or an average price of 
through march   we have repurchased an additional  shares for  bringing the total number of shares cumulatively purchased to  at a total cost of  or an average price of per share 
on february   our board of directors authorized us to enter into a transaction with steven kass  our chief financial officer  whereby mr 
kass surrendered  of his stock options that were expiring that month  in consideration for a purchase price of per share  reflecting a discount from the closing price of the common stock on february  after subtracting the underlying 
per share exercise price of the options  this resulted in a net buyback price to our company of per share  or  this is reflected as additional cash compensation expense to mr 
kass 
concurrently  mr 
kass exercised  options that were expiring on february  at an exercise price of 
per share  and  options that were expiring on july  at an exercise price of 
per share  consistent with the original terms of the grants 
the effect of these two transactions was a net cash outflow of the company to mr 
kass of  we have a  line of credit with wachovia bank 
any money borrowed under the line of credit will be at the prime rate of borrowing and any such loans will be secured by the assets of our company 
although management believes that we will be able to fund our operations during from current resources  there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so  and therefore  we established this facility to support short term cash flow constraints  if necessary 
this agreement will expire on april   but can be renewed for an additional one year term with the consent of both parties 
we intend to extend the facility 
there can be no assurances that this facility will be extended 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december  or december  cash flows year ended december  december  in thousands net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by financing activities  net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period  cash and cash equivalents at end of period  cash used in operating activities was  for the fiscal year ended december  compared with cash provided by operating activities of  for the fiscal year ended december  as the result of our continued investment in building inventories to support the seasonal aspect of our business and the change in production facilities 
during the year ended december   we paid bonuses to management of  and income taxes of  and in the year ended december   we paid bonuses to management of the  used in financing activities reflects the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
as a result of our use of  in operating activities and  in financing activities in the fiscal year ended december   our cash and cash equivalents declined by  to we believe that we will be able to fund our operations during the next twelve months with cash generated from operations and from borrowings on our line of credit 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements during the next twelve months 
contractual obligations we have no contractual obligations at december  inflation and seasonality we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding two years 
there can be no assurance  however  that our operating results will not be affected by inflation in the future 
our business is subject to minimal seasonal variations with slightly increased sales historically in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
we expect to continue to experience slightly higher sales in the second and third quarters  and slightly lower sales in the fourth and first quarters  as a result of reduced sales of nondairy frozen desserts during those periods 
market risk we will invest our excess cash  should there be any  in highly rated money market funds which are subject to changes in short term interest rates
