table of contents valuation of financial instruments financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased are recorded at fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
unrealized gains or losses are generally recognized in principal transactions in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the following is a summary of the fair value of major categories of financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  as of december  and december  in thousands of dollars december  december  financial financial instruments instruments financial sold  financial sold  instruments not yet instruments not yet owned purchased owned purchased corporate equity securities corporate debt securities us government  federal agency and other sovereign obligations mortgage and asset backed securities loans derivatives investments at fair value other fair value hierarchy we adopted fasb  fair value measurements fasb  as of the beginning of fasb defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
fasb maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the transparency of inputs as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date 
the nature of these financial instruments include cash instruments for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently  derivative instruments whose fair value have been derived using a model where inputs to the model are directly observable in the market  or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  and instruments that are fair valued using other financial instruments  the parameters of which can be directly observed 
level instruments that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date 
these financial instruments do not have two way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value  where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation 

table of contents the availability of observable inputs can vary for different products 
fair value is a market based measure  therefore  when market observable inputs are not available  our judgment is applied to reflect those judgments that a market participant would use in valuing the same asset or liability 
we use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date even in periods of market disruption or illiquidity 
greater judgment in valuation is required when inputs are less observable or unobservable in the marketplace and judgment must be applied in determining the appropriateness of available prices  particularly in assessing whether available data reflects current prices and or reflects the results of recent market transactions 
the valuation of financial instruments classified in level of the fair value hierarchy involves the greatest amount of management judgment 
in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which addresses the use of judgment in determining whether a transaction in a dislocated market represents fair value  the inclusion of market participant risk adjustments when an entity significantly adjusts observable market data based on unobservable inputs  and the degree of reliance to be placed on broker quotes or pricing services 
when a market for an asset is inactive  fsp fas provides for management to make adjustments to observable data in determining fair value 
our fair value measurement practices are consistent with the guidance in fsp fas valuation process for financial instruments financial instruments are valued at quoted market prices  if available 
for financial instruments that do not have readily determinable fair values through quoted market prices  the determination of fair value is based upon consideration of available information  including current financial information  restrictions on dispositions  fair values of underlying financial instruments and quotations for similar instruments 
certain financial instruments have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace 
for financial instruments whose inputs are based on bid ask prices  mid market pricing is applied and adjusted to the point within the bid ask range that meets our best estimate of fair value 
for offsetting positions in the same financial instrument  the same price within the bid ask spread is used to measure both the long and short positions 
the valuation process for financial instruments may include the use of valuation models and other techniques 
adjustments to valuations derived from valuation models may be made when  in management s judgment  either the size of the position in the financial instrument in a nonactive market or other features of the financial instrument such as its complexity  or the market in which the financial instrument is traded require that an adjustment be made to the value derived from the models 
an adjustment may be made if a financial instrument is subject to sales restrictions that would result in a price less than the quoted market price 
adjustments from the price derived from a valuation model reflect management s judgment that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would also consider in valuing that same financial instrument and are adjusted for assumptions about risk uncertainties and market conditions 
results from valuation models and valuation techniques in one period may not be indicative of future period fair value measurements 
cash products where quoted prices are available in an active market  cash products are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy and valued based on the quoted exchange price  which is generally obtained from pricing services 
level cash products are highly liquid instruments and include listed equity and money market securities and g government and agency securities 
cash products classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are based primarily on broker quotations  pricing service data from external providers and prices observed for recently executed market transactions 
if quoted market prices are not available for the specific security  then fair values are estimated by using pricing models  quoted prices of cash products with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models 
examples of cash products classified within level of the fair value hierarchy are corporate  convertible and municipal bonds and agency and non agency mortgage backed securities 
if there is limited transaction activity or less transparency to observe market based inputs to valuation models  cash products presented at fair value are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
fair values of cash products classified in level are generally based on an assessment of each underlying investment  cash flow models  market data of any recent comparable company transactions and trading multiples of companies considered comparable to the instrument being valued and incorporate assumptions regarding market outlook  among other factors 
cash products in this category include illiquid equity securities  equity interests in private companies  auction rate 
table of contents securities  commercial loans  private equity and hedge fund investments  distressed debt instruments and certain mortgage backed securities as little external price information is currently available for these products 
for distressed debt instruments and commercial loans  loss assumptions must be made based on default scenarios and market liquidity and prepayment assumptions must be made for mortgage backed securities 
derivative products exchange traded derivatives are valued using quoted market prices  which are generally obtained from pricing services  and are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
over the counter otc derivative products are generally valued using models  whose inputs reflect assumptions that we believe market participants would use in valuing the derivative in a current period transaction 
inputs to valuation models are appropriately calibrated to market data  including  but not limited to  yield curves  interest rates  volatilities  equity  debt and commodity prices and credit curves 
fair value can be modeled using a series of techniques  including the black scholes option pricing model and other comparable simulation models 
for certain otc derivative contracts  inputs to valuation models do not involve a high degree of subjectivity as the valuation model inputs are readily observable or can be derived from actively quoted markets 
otc derivative contracts classified in level include credit default swaps  interest rate swaps  foreign currency forwards  commodity swaps and option contracts  equity option contracts and to be announced securities 
derivative products that are valued based on models with significant unobservable market inputs are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
level derivative products include equity warrant and option contracts where the volatility of the underlying equity securities is not observable due to the terms of the contracts and the correlation sensitivity to market indices is not transparent for the term of the derivatives 
at december   the measurements of our cash products and derivative products at fair value were based on the following financial financial instruments sold  valuation basis instruments owned not yet purchased exchange closing prices recently observed transaction prices data providers pricing services broker quotes valuation techniques pricing information obtained from external data providers may incorporate a range of market quotes from dealers  recent market transactions and benchmarking model derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for comparable securities 
external pricing data is subject to evaluation for reasonableness using a variety of means including comparisons of prices to those of similar product types  quality and maturities  consideration of the narrowness or wideness of the range of prices obtained  knowledge of recent market transactions and an assessment of the similarity in prices to comparable dealer offerings in a recent time period 

table of contents certain cash products and derivative products trade infrequently and therefore have little price transparency 
as a result  we may use alternative valuation techniques or valuation models as methods for determining fair value 
when using alternative valuation techniques or valuation models  the following techniques are applied to different financial instruments classes financial instrument classes valuation techniques equity securities and convertible bonds valuations based on pending transactions involving the issuer or comparable companies  subsequent financings or recapitalizations  changes in financial ratios and cash flows of the underlying issuer and prices of comparable securities high yield corporate bonds valuations based on pending transactions involving the issuer or comparable companies  subsequent financings or recapitalizations  changes in financial ratios and cash flows of the underlying issuer and prices of comparable securities non agency mortgage backed and other asset backed securities benchmarked to yields from market prices for comparable securities and calibrated based on expected cash flow characteristics of the underlying assets auction rate securities internal methodology based on projected cash flows discounted for lack of liquidity for the securities corporate bank and other commercial loans and other receivables references to prices for other debt instruments of the same issuer  estimates of expected future cash flows incorporating assumptions regarding creditor default and or recovery investments in hedge funds  funds of funds and certain private equity funds net asset values  as adjusted for any redemption restrictions investments in certain private equity funds discounted cash flow techniques otc equity and commodity options and equity warrants black scholes and comparable simulation models interest rate  credit default  commodity and total return swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts modeling  primarily involving discounted cash flows  which incorporate observable inputs related to interest rate curves  commodity indices  equity prices and volatilities  foreign currency spot curves and credit spreads of the underlying credit 
table of contents level assets and liabilities level assets were million and million as of december  and december   respectively  and represented approximately and  respectively  of total assets measured at fair value 
level liabilities were million and million as of december  and december   respectively  and represented approximately and  respectively  of total liabilities measured at fair value 
at december  and  level financial instruments were comprised of the following asset and liability classes financial instruments sold  financial instruments owned not yet purchased december  december  december  december  in thousands corporate bonds loans and other receivables investments in hedge funds  fund of funds  and private equity funds mortgage and asset backed securities equity securities and warrants auction rate securities collateralized loan obligations derivative instruments total level financial instruments level financial instruments for which the firm bears no economic exposure level financial instruments for which the firm bears economic exposure during the year ended december   we had transfers of assets of million from level to level these reclassifications were primarily related to high yield corporate bonds as market quotes became less observable throughout the year due to less frequent or nominal market activity for the asset class and the opaqueness of observable credit spreads 
during the year ended december   we had transfers of assets of million from level to level these reclassifications were primarily related to high yield corporate bonds where trading activity observed and recently executed transactions provided transparency for purposes of determining fair values 
during the year ended december   we had net transfers of liabilities of million from level to level net losses on level assets of million for the year ended december  are attributed primarily to equity warrants due to declining underlying equity prices and increased market volatility  collateralized loan obligations due to widening corporate credit spreads during the quarter  certain trade claims due to increasing default probabilities and declines in valuations for investments in private equity and hedge funds 
net gains on level liabilities of million for the year ended december  are attributed to gains on short equity options due to decreases in underlying equity prices 
see note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the classification of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
controls over the valuation process for financial instruments our risk management department  independent of the trading function  plays an important role in determining that our financial instruments are appropriately valued and that fair value measurements are reliable 
this is particularly important where prices or valuations that require inputs are less observable 
in the event that observable inputs are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable 
these control processes include reviews of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by risk management personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks 

table of contents where a pricing model is used to determine fair value  recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model 
an independent price verification process  separate from the trading process  is in place to ensure that observable market prices and market based inputs are applied in valuation where possible 
goodwill as a result of acquisitions  we have acquired goodwill  of which the balance of million at december  is wholly attributed to our capital markets segment  which is our reporting unit under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
at least annually  we are required to assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the operating segment with its net book value 
periodically estimating the fair value of the capital markets segment requires significant judgment 
we estimate the fair value of the operating segment based on valuation methodologies we believe market participants would use  including consideration of control premiums for recent acquisitions observed in the marketplace 
we completed our annual impairment test as of september  and no impairment was identified 
during  the financial services sector and the equity markets in general were affected by declines in stock prices and by lack of liquidity 
our market capitalization declined below recorded book value at various points during the year  particularly in the second half of  though we believe that market capitalization as a fair value indicator should be considered in the context of a reasonable time frame and general market conditions 
we have updated our goodwill impairment assessment subsequent to our annual testing date and no impairment was identified as of december  the judgments applied in estimating the fair value of our operating segment have an impact on the evaluation of any impairment and continued weakness in the financial markets and broad economy could unfavorably affect our assessments in the future 
compensation and benefits the use of estimates is important in determining compensation and benefits expenses for interim periods 
a portion of our compensation and benefits represents discretionary bonuses  which are finalized at year end 
in addition to the level of net revenues  our overall compensation expense in any given year is influenced by prevailing labor markets  revenue mix and  through  our use of share based compensation programs 
we believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated annual discretionary bonuses among interim periods is in proportion to projected net revenues earned 
consequently  during the year we accrue compensation and benefits based on annual targeted compensation ratios  taking into account the guidance contained in fasb r regarding the timing of expense recognition for non retirement eligible and retirement eligible employees 
our fourth quarter of reflects changes in our interim estimates of total compensation and benefits we determine to be paid for the full year based on finalized levels of compensation 
business environment during the first half of  economic growth slowed and the us entered a recession 
the lessening of liquidity that began in accelerated during and the us markets experienced unprecedented challenges as credit further contracted  the downturn in economic growth broadened  and a number of major financial institutions faced serious problems 
concerns regarding future economic growth and corporate earnings  as well as illiquidity in the credit markets created challenging conditions for the equity markets which experienced significant broad based declines  with equity indices significantly lower at the end of as compared to the end of fixed income and equity markets experienced high levels of volatility  broad based declines in asset prices and further reduced levels of liquidity  particularly in the fourth quarter of the impact of these events created extreme uncertainty around company and asset values  creating a challenging environment for investment banking advisory businesses and sharply narrowing opportunities to distribute securities in the equity and debt capital markets 
the us dollar initially weakened against major currencies during the first part of  but recovered in the latter half of the year as the economic slowdown accelerated in non us economies in the second half of  with significant depreciation in the british pound and euro against the us dollar by year end 

table of contents the financial landscape has also been altered dramatically over the course of the year with the bankruptcy of lehman brothers holdings inc  acquisitions and consolidations of major financial institutions  the federal government assuming a conservatorship role of both the federal home loan mortgage corporation and the federal national mortgage association and the conversion of goldman sachs group  inc and morgan stanley into bank holding companies 
in early october  the emergency economic stabilization act of was enacted  which  among other matters  enables the us treasury to purchase mortgage related and other trouble assets from us financial institutions 
the us treasury has taken additional measures to provide liquidity to the capital markets and the us federal reserve reduced its federal funds target rate to a range of to  its lowest level since the yield on the year us treasury note declined to at the end of from at the beginning of the year 
markets outside of the us experienced similar conditions with foreign governments taking similar actions within their borders to provide liquidity to financial institutions  including reductions in benchmark interests by the central banks  and also  in some cases  assuming conservatorship roles over certain financial institutions 
growth declined across virtually all global economies and the equity indices across europe  asia and emerging markets ended notably lower for the year 
the results of our operations for reflect these challenging market factors  which contributed to declining inventory valuations and reduced levels of capital markets activity 
competitor consolidation and the destabilization of the financial markets during these periods have conversely had a positive impact on business prospects as we have seen new customer activity across many of our businesses 
however  a continuation of the volatile markets and unfavorable economic conditions of could have a material impact on our business and results of operations for the near term of and possibly subsequent years

as a result of the removal of the service requirements  we accelerated the expensing of any remaining unamortized share based compensation costs in december with respect to previously granted awards on the modification date  with a total compensation cost of million 
prior to this modification  restricted stock and rsus awarded to employees were generally subject to continued service and employment requirements with the grant date fair value of these awards amortized as compensation expense over the required service period  which was typically five years 
as part of our annual compensation process  we granted approximately million shares of restricted stock and rsus to employees in december as these year end awards contain termination provisions comparable to the terms of the overall approved compensation strategy  we recognized the full grant date fair value expense associated with these restricted stock and rsus awards of million immediately upon grant date in the current year 
we believe these changes to share based compensation more economically manage our overall employee compensation commensurate with the related production of revenues by our businesses 
excluding the impact of modifications to our share based compensation awards and severance costs  the higher ratio of compensation expense to net revenues for as compared to results primarily from weaker than anticipated revenue production from certain business lines in which a minimum level of compensation costs are necessary in order to maintain appropriate personnel levels for competitiveness  as well as commission based compensation paid in respect of revenue production in certain divisions where revenues include substantial trading losses 
additionally  while we have sizably reduced our employee headcount at year end as compared to the beginning of  during the year we made significant hires both domestically and internationally in connection with expanding our mortgage  corporate bond and international equity trading capabilities  which temporarily increases compensation costs as production revenues build 
these key hires allow us to selectively take advantage of the dislocation in the markets in certain sectors and enhance our business mix and product offering capabilities 
v 
compensation and benefits expense  including the amortization of previously awarded restricted stock and rsus increased million  or  to a total of million as compared to million for employee headcount increased from  at december  to  at december  the increase in compensation and benefits expense was driven by increased business activities and growth initiatives  both domestically and internationally 
specifically  during we hired certain senior level employees as part of our growth initiatives 
compensation and benefits expense for also reflects an increase in amortization expense of share based awards from prior years as compared to as compensation policy changes in caused greater amounts of share based awards to be issued to senior level employees as compared to cash compensation 
additional information relating to issuances pursuant to our employee share based compensation plans is contained in consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity on page  share based compensation included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  and compensation plans included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
non compensation expense v 
non compensation expenses were million for  a increase as compared to  which reflects increased technology and communications costs consistent with our expanding business activities and trading platforms  as well as other significant costs incurred in included within other non interest expenses are million in non recoverable legal fees for investment banking transactions that did not close and other bad debt expense items for which we have fully reserved at year end 
additionally  during we recognized costs incurred in the unwinding of securities lending transactions with lehman brothers  inc and landsbankinn as counterparties and other credit losses attributed to exposures from lehman brothers totaling approximately million and we recognized reorganization costs for fixed asset write offs and lease exit costs of million as part of our announced office closings and other structural changes

the change in effective tax rates in and rate is due to the minority interest holdings in jhyh which are not taxed at the jefferies group level  a decrease in state and local income taxes and return to provision adjustments for amounts previously deemed to be non deductible 
minority interest minority interest consists of third party interests in jhyh effective april  and our consolidated asset management funds 
minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries was million for compared to minority interest in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries of million for and million for for the year ended december   the decrease in earnings attributable to minority interest holders from is primarily due to net losses for recognized by jefferies high yield holdings  llc  which is consolidated by us

these policies are determined by the nature of our day to day business operations  business growth possibilities  regulatory obligations  and liquidity requirements 
recent market conditions have been  and continue to be  volatile  with tightening in the availability of funding with illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
lending within the interbank market has been reduced and concerns as to counterparty stability have led to further reduction in available borrowings from institutional investors and lenders 
we have no scheduled maturities on our long term borrowings until  nominal short term borrowings and significant cash balances on hand 
we continue to actively manage our liquidity profile and counterparty relationships given current credit market conditions 
our actual level of capital  total assets  and financial leverage are a function of a number of factors  including  asset composition  business initiatives  regulatory requirements and cost availability of both long term and short term funding 
we have historically maintained a highly liquid balance sheet  with a substantial portion of our total assets consisting of cash  highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables  arising principally from traditional securities brokerage activity 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in financing and managing our business

of the million of uncommitted lines of credit  million is unsecured and million is secured 
secured amounts are collateralized by a combination of customer  non customer and firm securities 
letters of credit are used in the normal course of business mostly to satisfy various collateral requirements in lieu of depositing cash or securities 

table of contents liquidity management policies the primary goal of our liquidity management activities is to ensure adequate funding over a range of market environments 
the key objectives of the liquidity management framework are to support the successful execution of our business strategies while ensuring sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress 
our liquidity management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations without material franchise or business impact 
the principal elements of our liquidity management framework are the funding action plan and the cash capital policy 
funding action plan 
the funding action plan models a potential liquidity contraction over a one year time period 
our funding action plan model scenarios incorporate potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event  including  but not limited to  the following a repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year and no incremental unsecured debt issuance  b maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral  c higher margin requirements on or lower availability of secured funding  d client cash withdrawals  e the anticipated funding of outstanding investment commitments and f certain accrued expenses and other liabilities and fixed costs 
cash capital policy 
we maintain a cash capital model that measures long term funding sources against requirements 
sources of cash capital include our equity  preferred stock and the non current portion of long term borrowings 
uses of cash capital include the following a illiquid assets such as buildings  equipment  goodwill  net intangible assets  exchange memberships  deferred tax assets and certain investments  b a portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment ie  margin requirements and c drawdowns of unfunded commitments 
we seek to maintain a surplus cash capital position 
our equity capital of  million  mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock of million and long term borrowings debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than months of  million comprise our total capital of  million as of december   which exceeded cash capital requirements

tangible book value per share equals tangible stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding 
pro forma tangible book value per share equals tangible stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding adjusted for outstanding restricted stock units 
outstanding restricted stock units  which give the recipient the right to receive common shares at the end of a specified deferral period  are granted in connection with our share based employee incentive plans and include both awards that contain future service requirements and awards for which the future service requirements have been met 
tangible stockholders equity  tangible book value per share  pro forma book value per share and pro forma tangible book value per share are non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance that includes adjustments to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  or for which there is no specific gaap guidance 
we calculate tangible stockholders equity as stockholders equity less intangible assets  specifically goodwill 
goodwill is subtracted from stockholders equity in determining tangible stockholders equity as we believe that goodwill does not constitute an operating asset  which can be deployed in a liquid manner 
we calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible stockholders equity by common stock outstanding 
we calculate pro forma book value per share as stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding adjusted for outstanding restricted stock units 
we calculate pro forma tangible book value per share by dividing tangible stockholders equity by common shares outstanding adjusted for outstanding restricted stock units 
we believe the adjustment to shares outstanding for outstanding restricted stock units reflects potential economic claims on our net assets enabling shareholders to better assess their standing with respect to our financial condition 
valuations of financial companies are often measured as a multiple of tangible stockholders equity  inclusive of any dilutive effects  making these ratios  and changes in these ratios  a meaningful measurement for investors 
on december  we granted  shares of restricted stock as part of year end compensation

at december   contractual interest payment obligations related to our senior long term debt are million for each of the years through  million for and  million for all of the remaining periods after we rely upon our cash holdings and external sources to finance a significant portion of our day to day operations 
access to these external sources  as well as the cost of that financing  is dependent upon various factors  including our debt ratings 
our current debt ratings are dependent upon many factors  including industry dynamics  operating and economic environment  operating results  operating margins  earnings trend and volatility  balance sheet composition  liquidity and liquidity management  our capital structure  our overall risk management  business diversification and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate 
deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings thereby increasing the cost of obtaining funding and impacting certain trading revenues  particularly where collateral agreements are referenced to our external credit ratings

adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible stockholders equity 
adjusted assets excludes certain assets that are considered self funded and  therefore  of lower risk  which are generally financed by customer liabilities through our securities lending activities 
we view the resulting measure of adjusted leverage as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services companies 
risk management risk is an inherent part of our business and activities 
the extent to which we properly and effectively identify  assess  monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our activities is critical to our financial soundness and profitability 
we seek to identify  assess  monitor and manage the following principal risks involved in our business activities market  credit  operational  legal and compliance  new business  reputational and other 
risk management is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
our risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are fluid in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
market risk 
the potential for changes in the value of financial instruments is referred to as market risk 
our market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from a change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  commodity prices and foreign exchange rates  along with the level of volatility 
interest rate risks result primarily from exposure to changes in the yield curve  the volatility of interest rates  and credit spreads 
equity price risks result from exposure to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities  equity baskets and equity indices 
commodity price risks result from 
table of contents exposure to the changes in prices and volatilities of individual commodities  commodity baskets and commodity indices 
we make dealer markets in equity securities  debt securities and commodities 
we attempt to hedge our exposure to market risk by managing our net long or short positions 
due to imperfections in correlations  gains and losses can occur even for positions that are hedged 
position limits in trading and inventory accounts are established and monitored on an ongoing basis 
each day  consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to various levels of management  which enable management to monitor inventory levels and results of the trading groups 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that we would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of financial instruments  such as securities and derivatives  held by us fails to perform its contractual obligations 
we follow industry practices to reduce credit risk related to various trading  investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
we adjust margin requirements if we believe the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
liabilities to other brokers and dealers related to unsettled transactions ie  securities failed to receive are recorded at the amount for which the securities were purchased  and are paid upon receipt of the securities from other brokers or dealers 
in the case of aged securities failed to receive  we may purchase the underlying security in the market and seek reimbursement for losses from the counterparty in accordance with standard industry practices 
operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in our operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in our internal control processes 
our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies 
in addition  the transactions we process have become increasingly complex 
if any of our financial  accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems  we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity  financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
these systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings 
the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses 
we also face the risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions 
any such failure or termination could adversely affect our ability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located 
this may include a disruption involving electrical  communications  transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code  and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  this potentially could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our  our clients  our counterparties or third parties operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
legal and compliance risk 
legal and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  anti money 
table of contents laundering and record keeping 
we also maintain an anonymous hotline for employees or others to report suspected inappropriate actions by us or by our employees or agents 
new business risk 
new business risk refers to the risks of entering into a new line of business or offering a new product 
by entering a new line of business or offering a new product  we may face risks that we are unaccustomed to dealing with and may increase the magnitude of the risks we currently face 
we review proposals for new businesses and new products to determine if we are prepared to handle the additional or increased risks associated with entering into such activities 
reputational risk 
we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is an important aspect of minimizing legal and operational risks 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business activities 
we seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards 
other risk 
other risks encountered by us include political  regulatory and tax risks 
these risks reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions 
in an effort to mitigate these risks  we continuously review new and pending regulations and legislation and participate in various industry interest groups

fsp fas specifically addresses the use of judgment in determining whether a transaction in a dislocated market represents fair value  the inclusion of market participant risk adjustments when an entity significantly adjusts observable market data based on unobservable inputs  and the degree of reliance to be placed on broker quotes or pricing services 
fsp fas was effective immediately upon issuance and did not have an effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
fsp fas and fin r in december  the fasb issued fsp fas and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities fsp fas and fin r 
fsp fas and fin r require public entities to provide additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets and require public enterprises to provide additional

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use a number of quantitative tools to manage our exposure to market risk 
these tools include inventory position and exposure limits  on a gross and net basis  scenario analyses  stress tests and other analytical tools that measure the potential effects on our trading net revenues of various market events  including  but not limited to  a large widening of credit spreads  a substantial decline in equities markets and significant moves in selected emerging markets  and risk limits based on a summary measure of risk exposure referred to as value at risk 
value at risk we estimate value at risk var using a model that simulates revenue and loss distributions on all financial instruments by applying historical market changes to the current portfolio 
using the results of this simulation  var measures potential loss of trading revenues at a given confidence level over a specified time horizon 
we calculate var over a one day holding period measured at a confidence level which implies that  on average  we expect to realize a loss of daily trading revenue at least as large as the var amount on one out of every twenty trading days 
var is one measurement of potential loss in trading revenues that may result from adverse market movements over a specified period of time with a selected likelihood of occurrence 
as with all measures of var  our estimate has substantial limitations due to our reliance on historical performance  which is not necessarily a predictor of the future 
consequently  this var estimate is only one of a number of tools we use in our daily risk management activities 
var is a model that predicts the future risk based on historical data 
we could incur losses greater than the reported var because the historical market prices and rates changes may not be an accurate measure of future market events and conditions 
in addition  the var model measures the risk of a current static position over a one day horizon and might not predict the future position 
when comparing our var numbers to those of other firms  it is important to remember that different methodologies could produce significantly different results the var numbers below are shown separately for interest rate  equity  currency and commodity products  as well as for our overall trading positions  excluding corporate investments in asset management positions  using a historical simulation approach 
the aggregated var presented here is less than the sum of the individual components ie  interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk  equity risk and commodity price risk due to the benefit of diversification among the risk categories 
diversification benefit equals the difference between aggregated var and the sum of vars for the four risk categories 
the following table illustrates the var for each component of market risk

for the var numbers reported above  a one day time horizon and confidence level were used 
average var of million during decreased from the million average during due mainly to a decrease in exposure to equity prices 
var levels were elevated for a period of time after we acquired million common shares of leucadia national corp 
in april 
the following table presents our daily var over the last four quarters performance graph var back testing the comparison of daily actual revenue fluctuations with the daily var estimate is the primary method used to test the efficacy of the var model 
back testing is performed at various levels of the trading portfolio  from the holding company level down to specific business lines 
a back testing exception occurs when the daily loss exceeds the daily var estimate 
results of the process at the aggregate level demonstrated outliers when comparing the one day var with the back testing profit and loss in a confidence one day var model usually should not have more than twelve out of days back testing exceptions on an annual basis 
back testing profit and loss is a subset of actual trading revenue and includes only the profit and loss effects relevant to the var model  excluding fees  commissions and certain provisions 
we compare the trading revenue with var for back testing purposes because var assesses only the potential change in position value due to overnight movements in financial market variables such as prices  interest rates and volatilities under normal market conditions
