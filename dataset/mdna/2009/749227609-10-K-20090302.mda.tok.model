table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rait financial trust manages a portfolio of real estate related assets  provides a comprehensive set of debt financing options to the real estate industry and invests in real estate related assets 
our income is generated primarily from interest income from our investments  net of any financing costs  or net interest margin  fee income from originating and managing assets and rental income from our investments in real estate assets 
we continue to face challenging and volatile market conditions that began in the second half of  including significant disruptions in the credit markets  abrupt and significant devaluations of assets directly or indirectly linked to the real estate finance markets  and the attendant removal of liquidity  both long and short term  from the capital markets 
more recently  global recessionary economic conditions have developed and the capital markets have become even more volatile 
we cannot predict with any certainty the potential impact on our financial performance of contemplated or future government interventions in financial markets 
we seek to position rait to be able to take advantage of opportunities once market conditions improve and to maximize shareholder value over time 
to do this  we will continue to focus on managing our investment portfolios to reposition non performing assets and maximize cash flows  taking advantage of our commercial real estate platform to invest in the distressed commercial real estate debt market  reducing our leverage through additional purchases of our debt  managing the size and cost structure of our business to match today s operating environment  and developing new financing sources intended to maintain and increase our adjusted earnings and reit taxable income 
in the current economic environment  we are seeking to effectively manage and service our investment portfolios with a goal of continuing to generate cash flow from our securitizations and our investments 
we expect to continue to focus our efforts on our commercial real estate portfolio  while we expect our other portfolios to continue to generate significant cash flow 
given this environment  we continue to review investment opportunities within our own capital structure  such as collateral exchanges with our securitizations  to seek to improve the credit profile of  and maximize the distributions from  our securitizations 
we expect to enhance our ability to earn asset management and servicing fees in the future 
while our collateral management fees were reduced in by the increasing redirection of our subordinated management fees from securitizations due to the performance of the underlying collateral  we continued to earn substantial senior management fees and see opportunities for growth in this area 
in  we experienced lower asset originations and  accordingly  lower origination fees 
our return from originating new investments may increasingly be in the form of fees under the terms of new financing arrangements we develop  such as co investment and joint venturing strategies 
we originated a smaller amount of new investments in due to the economic conditions and the limited availability of new capital discussed above 
we expect our rate of originating new investments to remain lower than historical levels 
we continue to look for new investment opportunities  including investments in the distressed commercial real estate debt market 
during  we reduced our leverage and eliminated our exposure to short term repurchase debt subject to margin calls 
we also have repurchased  and expect to continue to repurchase  our discounted debt 
we will also continue to seek and develop alternative financing sources while focusing on enhancing our liquidity 
during the years ended december  and  we generated adjusted earnings per diluted share of and  respectively  total loss per diluted share of and  respectively  and gross cash flow of 
table of contents million and million  respectively 
our gaap net losses in the years ended december  and were primarily caused by the following allowance for losses 
we increased our allowance for losses to million as of december  from million as of december  the provision for losses recorded during the year ended december  was million and resulted from increased delinquencies in our residential mortgage loans and increased non performing loans in our commercial real estate portfolios 
performance in our commercial real estate portfolio has deteriorated during as of december   we had million of non performing loans  an increase of million from million of non performing loans as of december  worsening economic conditions  reduced occupancy  lack of liquidity and  in some cases  bankruptcy by our borrowers  has caused the increase in our non performing loans and the related increase in our allowance for losses 
we increased our allowance for losses on our commercial real estate portfolio to million as of december  from million as of december  during the year ended december   delinquencies in our residential mortgage portfolios increased by million  or  to million as of december  compared to million as of december  during this same period  house prices across the united states declined dramatically coupled with a steady and significant increase in loan foreclosures 
as a result of these trends  we increased our allowance for losses on our residential mortgages to million as of december  from million as of december  changes in fair value of financial instruments 
during  the change in fair value of our financial instruments fluctuated significantly from historical levels due to the continuing turmoil in the credit markets 
the change in fair value of our financial instruments was a net decrease of million during the year ended december   before minority interest allocations of million 
this change was comprised of a decrease in the fair value of our financial assets totaling billion  a decrease in the fair value of our financial liabilities totaling billion and a decrease in the fair value of our interest rate derivatives totaling million 
due to the volatility of the financial markets  we are unable to predict with any level of certainty the future changes in the fair value of our financial instruments 
asset impairments 
we recorded asset impairments of million during the year ended december  these asset impairments were comprised of million associated with investments in securities whose cash flows were reduced during from collateral defaults  million associated with intangible assets  and million associated with direct real estate investments where the expected recovery value of the property has diminished below our investment basis 
our commercial real estate loans are our primary investment portfolio generating million  or  and million  or  of our gross cash flow during the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  we originated million and  million  respectively  of new commercial real estate loans 
worsening economic conditions have subjected borrowers under our commercial real estate loans to financial stress  which has increased the number of loans on non accrual and caused us to increase our allowance for losses 
we continue to actively monitor and manage these loans 
where it is likely to enhance our returns  we consider restructuring loans  including restructuring that results in our consolidation of the underlying property 
as we continue to pursue ways of improving our overall recovery and repayment on these loans  we may experience temporary reductions in net investment income and cash flow 
cmbs financing has become less available as a source of refinancing for our borrowers  which slowed the pace of refinancing by our borrowers while also creating new lending opportunities for us 
the us government sponsored entities fannie mae and freddie mac continue to provide financing for the acquisition and refinancing of multi family properties  which may positively impact our loans collateralized by multi family properties 
liquidity for other commercial property types remains limited since banks are hesitant to lend and the securitization market for commercial real estate assets effectively has ceased 
a substantial portion of our commercial real estate portfolio will mature in we expect that we will restructure increasing numbers of loans in the event our borrowers cannot obtain sources of refinancing upon maturity 

table of contents our portfolio of residential mortgages generated million  or  and million  or  of our gross cash flow during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have seen the delinquency rates in our residential mortgage portfolio increase  which resulted in increases in our loan loss reserves and the number and amount of loans on non accrual status 
our portfolio of trups generated million  or  and million  or  of our gross cash flow during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we continue to experience credit deterioration of trups issuers 
this credit deterioration adversely affects the cash flow we receive from our securitizations and the fair value of their collateral 
we continue to seek remedies and other means of restructuring our trups so as to improve the overall recovery in future periods 
in january  taberna viii and taberna ix did not receive interest payments from a borrower which resulted in the re direction of cash flow to repay principal of senior debt in each of these securitizations 
while we believe we have made appropriate adjustments to the valuation of our investments and our provision for losses in our residential mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios  future operations may be adversely affected by similar conditions in our investment portfolio 
adoption of sfas no 
prior to january   we recorded certain of our investments in securities and derivatives at fair value 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   we adjusted the carrying amounts of certain investments in securities  certain cdo notes payable  certain derivative instruments and other assets and liabilities to fair value resulting in an increase to shareholders equity of billion on january  subsequent to january   we reflect the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  with all changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
the following table summarizes the cumulative net fair value adjustments through december  for the specific financial assets and liabilities we elected for the fair value option under sfas no 
dollars in thousands fair value adjustments as of december  sfas no 
fair value adjustments on january  sfas no 
fair value adjustments during the year ended december  cumulative fair value adjustments as of december  assets investments in securities deferred financing costs  net of accumulated amortization liabilities trust preferred obligations cdo notes payable derivative liabilities other liabilities fair value adjustments before allocation to minority interest allocation of fair value adjustments to minority interest cumulative effect on shareholders equity prior to january   trading securities were classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
accordingly  the election of the fair value option under sfas no 
for trading securities did not change their carrying value and resulted in a reclassification of million from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to retained earnings deficit on january  
table of contents through december   the cumulative effect of the fair value adjustments recorded on each financial asset and liability selected for the fair value option under sfas no 
was a net increase in shareholders equity of million 
this net increase in shareholders equity may reverse through earnings as an unrealized loss in the future 
for example  in the event our cdo notes payable were to recover some or all of their par amount  at a speed that exceeds any recovery of par amount by our investments in securities  the difference in the respective par amount recoveries could adversely affect earnings 
given the market conditions referred to above and the volatility in interest rates and the credit performance of our underlying collateral  we cannot determine whether further fluctuations in the fair value of our assets and liabilities subject to sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial performance 
trends that may affect our business the following trends may affect our business credit  capital markets and liquidity risk 
we expect that the credit events that occurred during  which have significantly reduced market liquidity and limited our financing strategies  will continue to significantly limit our ability to finance investments in our targeted asset classes for the foreseeable future 
we expect that these events may cause additional covenant defaults  increased delinquencies or missed payments from issuers of trups  our portfolio of commercial real estate loans or from our portfolio of residential mortgage loans 
this will likely cause reductions in our net investment income  increases in our provision for losses  decreases in the fair value of our assets  increases in our asset impairments and may reduce the cash flows we receive from our securitizations 
to finance investments in our commercial loan portfolio in the future  management will seek to structure match funded financing opportunities through the use of restricted cash in  and through the reinvestment of repayment amounts received under  our current securitizations and through loan participations  bank lines of credit  joint venture opportunities and other methods that preserve our capital while making investments that generate an attractive return 
interest rate environment 
interest rates experienced significant volatility during the year ended december  continued volatility in interest rates may impact the fair value of our investments and or the net investment income generated by those investments in the future 
we do not expect that an increase or decrease in interest rates would dramatically impact our net investment income generated by our residential mortgage and commercial and mezzanine loan portfolios 
our investments in residential mortgages have been financed through the issuance of mortgage backed securities that bear interest at rates with similar terms as those of the underlying residential mortgages  effectively match funding our investments with our liabilities 
in the case of investments in commercial and mezzanine loans  we use floating rate line of credit borrowings and long term floating rate cdo notes payable to finance our investments 
to the extent the quantity of fixed rate commercial and mezzanine loans are not directly offset by matching fixed rate cdo notes payable  we utilize interest rate derivative contracts to convert our floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities  effectively match funding our assets with our liabilities 
our investments in securities are comprised of trups  subordinated debentures  unsecured debt securities and cmbs held by our consolidated cdo entities 
these securities bear fixed and floating interest rates 
a large portion of these fixed rate securities are hybrid instruments  which convert to floating rate securities after a five or ten year fixed rate period 
we have financed these securities through the issuance of floating rate and fixed rate cdo notes payable 
a large portion of the cdo notes payable are floating rate instruments  and we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert this floating rate debt into fixed rate debt during the period in which our investments in securities are paid at a fixed coupon rate 
by using this hedging strategy  we believe we have effectively match funded our assets with liabilities during the fixed rate period of our investments in securities 
an increase or decrease in interest rates will generally not impact our net investment income generated by our 
table of contents investments in securities 
however  an increase or decrease in interest rates will affect the fair value of our investments in securities  which will generally be reflected in our financial statements as changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
prepayment rates 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise  but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict 
prepayment rates on our assets also may be affected by other factors  including  without limitation  conditions in the housing  real estate and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on adjustable rate and fixed rate loans 
if interest rates begin to fall  triggering an increase in prepayment rates in our residential mortgage and commercial loan portfolio  our net investment income may decrease 
however  the lack of financing alternatives may cause loans to extend and provide an opportunity to increase the net investment income 
while interest rates have decreased substantially during  prepayment rates have not increased due to the lack of mortgage financing in the current economic and credit environments 
residential housing prices  delinquency rates and lending 
in recent periods  home values have declined  the number of mortgage defaults has been increasing and the availability of residential mortgage financing has been declining substantially 
increasing foreclosure activity is resulting from underwater mortgages on which the balance owed is more than the current value of the property  and defaults on loan payments by homeowners due to adjustments of the payment amount or the effect of economic conditions on the homeowner 
the federal government has proposed a plan intended to address residential housing issues 
legislation has also been proposed to change federal bankruptcy law so that judges can unilaterally reduce the mortgage debt owed by borrowers in bankruptcy proceedings 
we cannot predict the impact of this plan or proposal on us in general or our residential mortgage portfolio in particular 
commercial real estate lack of liquidity and reduced performance 
the market for cmbs and other sources of financing for commercial real estate has contracted severely  creating increased risk of defaults upon the maturity of loans due to the lack of sources of refinancing 
due to current economic conditions  the multi family  office and retail sectors of commercial real estate are seeing increased vacancy levels and reduced rents 
we cannot predict the severity of future increases in vacancy levels and reductions of rent 
critical accounting estimates and policies we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of how we report our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on the judgment of our management 
our financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for investment income 
we recognize interest income from investments in debt and other securities  residential mortgages  commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans on a yield to maturity basis 
upon the acquisition of a loan at a discount  we assess the portions of the discount that constitutes accretable yields and non accretable differences 
the accretable yield represents the excess of our expected cash flows from the loan over the amount we paid for the loan 
that amount  the accretable yield  is accreted to interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
many of our commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans provide for the accrual of interest at specified rates which differ from current payment terms 
interest income is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible 
management evaluates loans for non accrual status each reporting period 
payments received for loans on non accrual status are applied to principal until the loan is removed from 
table of contents non accrual status 
past due interest is recognized on non accrual loans when they are removed from non accrual status and are making current interest payments 
for investments that we did not elect to record at fair value under sfas no 
 origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized to net investment income  using the effective interest method  over the contractual life of the underlying loan security or loan  in accordance with sfas no 
for investments that we elected to record at fair value under sfas no 
 origination fees and direct loan costs are recorded in income and are not deferred 
we recognize interest income from interests in certain securitized financial assets on an estimated effective yield to maturity basis 
management estimates the current yield on the amortized cost of the investment based on estimated cash flows after considering prepayment and credit loss experience 
investments 
we invest in debt securities  residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other types of real estate related assets 
we account for our investments in securities under sfas no 
 and designate each investment as a trading security  an available for sale security  or a held to maturity security based on our intent at the time of acquisition 
under sfas no 
 trading securities are recorded at their fair value each reporting period with fluctuations in fair value reported as a component of earnings 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
see fair value of financial instruments 
our estimate of fair value is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions and management assumptions 
upon the sale of an available for sale security  the realized gain or loss on the sale will be recorded as a component of earnings in the respective period 
held to maturity investments are carried at amortized cost at each reporting period 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
see recent accounting pronouncements 
in applying sfas no 
 we classified certain of our available for sale securities as trading securities on january  trading securities are carried at their estimated fair value  with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
we account for our investments in subordinated debentures owned by trust vies that we consolidate as available for sale securities 
these vies have no ability to sell  pledge  transfer or otherwise encumber the trust or the assets of the trust until such subordinated debenture s maturity 
we account for investments in securities where the transfer meets the criteria as a financing under sfas no 
 at amortized cost 
our investments in security related receivables represent securities that were transferred to issuers of cdos in which the transferors maintained some level of continuing involvement 
we account for our investments in residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other loans at amortized cost 
the carrying value of these investments is adjusted for origination discounts premiums  nonrefundable fees and direct costs for originating loans which are amortized into income on a level yield basis over the terms of the loans 
mortgage related receivables represent loan receivables secured by residential mortgages  the legal title to which is held by our consolidated securitizations 
these residential mortgages were transferred to the consolidated securitizations in transactions accounted for as financings under sfas no 
mortgage related receivables maintain all of the economic attributes of the underlying residential mortgages and all benefits or risks of that ownership inure to the trust subsidiary 
we use our judgment to determine whether an investment in securities has sustained an other than temporary decline in value 
if management determines that an investment in securities has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings  and we establish a new cost basis for the investment 
our evaluation of an other than temporary decline is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that we consider in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the estimated fair value of the investment in relation to our cost basis  the financial condition of the related entity  and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the fair value of the investment 

table of contents allowance for losses 
we maintain an allowance for losses on our investments in residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other loans 
our allowance for losses is based on management s evaluation of known losses and inherent risks  for example  historical and industry loss experience  economic conditions and trends  estimated fair values  the quality of collateral and other relevant factors 
specific allowances for losses on our commercial and mezzanine loans are established for impaired loans based on a comparison of the recorded carrying value of the loan to either the present value of the loan s expected cash flow  the loan s estimated market price or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
our allowance for loss on residential mortgage loans is evaluated collectively for impairment as the mortgage loans are homogenous pools of residential mortgages 
the allowance is increased by charges to operations and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
transfers of financial assets 
we account for transfers of financial assets under sfas no 
as either sales or financings 
transfers of financial assets that result in sales accounting are those in which the transfer legally isolates the transferred assets from the transferor  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and no condition both constrains the transferee s right to pledge or exchange the assets and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor  and the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
if the transfer does not meet these criteria  the transfer is accounted for as a financing 
financial assets that are treated as sales are removed from our accounts with any realized gain loss reflected in earnings during the period of sale 
financial assets that are treated as financings are maintained on the balance sheet with proceeds received from the legal transfer reflected as securitized borrowings  or security related receivables 
derivative instruments 
we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings 
certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets 
the principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we measure each derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts at fair value and record such amounts in our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  derivatives not designated as hedges  or for derivatives for which we elected the fair value option under sfas no 
 the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the changes in the fair value of the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income 
changes in the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings 
fair value of financial instruments 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which requires additional disclosures about our assets and liabilities that we measure at fair value 
as defined in sfas no 
 fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
where available  fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters 
where observable prices or inputs are not available  valuation models are applied 
these valuation techniques involve management estimation and judgment  the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity for disclosure purposes 
beginning in january  assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value 
hierarchical levels  as defined in sfas no 
and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities are as follows level valuations are based on unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
the types of assets carried at level fair value generally are equity securities listed in active markets 
as such  valuations of these investments do not entail a significant degree of judgment 

table of contents level valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly 
fair value assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are unsecured reit note receivables  commercial mortgage backed securities  or cmbs  receivables and certain financial instruments classified as derivatives where the fair value is based on observable market inputs 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset 
generally  assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are trups and subordinated debentures  trust preferred obligations and cdo notes payable where observable market inputs do not exist 
the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of investment  whether the investment is new  whether the investment is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market  and the current market condition 
to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
accordingly  the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  for disclosure purposes  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
we use prices and inputs that management believes are current as of the measurement date  including during periods of market dislocation 
in periods of market dislocation  the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments 
this condition could cause an instrument to be transferred from level to level or level to level many financial institutions have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace 
bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others are willing to pay for an asset 
ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others are willing to accept for an asset 
for financial instruments whose inputs are based on bid ask prices  we do not require that fair value always be a predetermined point in the bid ask range 
our policy is to allow for mid market pricing and adjusting to the point within the bid ask range that results in our best estimate of fair value 
fair value for certain of our level financial instruments is derived using internal valuation models 
these internal valuation models include discounted cash flow analyses developed by management using current interest rates  estimates of the term of the particular instrument  specific issuer information and other market data for securities without an active market 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the impact of our own credit spreads is also considered when measuring the fair value of financial assets or liabilities  including derivative contracts 
where appropriate  valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors  including bid ask spreads  credit quality and market liquidity 
these adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are based on observable inputs where available 
management s estimate of fair value requires significant management judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions  the availability of specific issuer information and management s assumptions
